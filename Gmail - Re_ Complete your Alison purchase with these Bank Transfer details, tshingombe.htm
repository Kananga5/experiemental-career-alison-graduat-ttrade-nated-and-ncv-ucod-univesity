theories or models of development boldly assert that certain changes
happen to virtually every person on the planet, and often at relatively
predictable points in life.&nbsp;<br>A theory may assert that toddlers
acquire a spoken language, or that teenagers form a sense of personal
identity. Individuals who do not experience these developments would be
rare, though not necessarily disabled as a result. Other theories
propose developmental changes that are more limited, claiming only that
the changes happen to some people or only under certain conditions.&nbsp;<br><b>Example:</b><br>Developing
a female gender role does not happen to everyone, but only to the
females in a population, and the details vary according to the family,
community or society in which a child lives.</div></div></span><span role="tabpanel" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135gmail-mat-tab-content-0-1" aria-labelledby="mat-tab-label-0-1"></span></div></span></span></div></div>

understand this point, imagine two children of about the same age who
have dramatically very different childhood experiences - for example,
one who grows up in poverty and another who grows up financially
well-off.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_108.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In what sense can we say that these two children experience the same underlying developmental changes as they grow up?&nbsp;<br>And how much should they even be expected to do so?&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Developmental
psychology highlights the “sameness” or common ground between these two

refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple sources and
multiple effects. The faster and simpler the change is, the more likely
it is to be called “learning” instead of development.<br>Students’ development matters for teachers, but the way it matters depends partly on how schooling is organised.&nbsp;<br>Developmental trends in human beings vary in two important ways. Developmental trends differ in:</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">1. Their generality<br>2. How strictly they are sequenced and hierarchical</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
some views of development, changes are thought to happen in a specific
order and to build on each other like a sort of “staircase” model of
development (Case, 1991, 1996).&nbsp;<br>In other views of development,
change happens, but not with a sequence or end point that is uniform.
This sort of change is more like a “kaleidoscope” than a staircase
(Levinson, 1990; Lewis, 1997; Harris, 2006).&nbsp;</div></span></div></div>

it may be tempting to think that physical development is the concern of
physical education teachers only, it is actually a foundation for many
academic tasks, e.g. it is important to know whether children can
successfully manipulate a pencil or how long students can be expected to
sit still without discomfort.&nbsp; <br>At all class levels, it is important
to have a sense of students’ health needs related to their age or
maturity, if only to know who may become ill, and with what illness, and
to know what physical activities are reasonable and needed.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
table below shows typical height and weight for well-nourished, healthy
students. The figure shows averages for several ages, but it does not
show the diversity among children, e.g. at age 6, the average boy or
girl is about 115cm tall, but some are 109cm and others are 125cm.
Average weight at age 6 is about 20kg, but ranges between about 16kg and

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The social developments that are most obviously relevant to classroom life fall into three main areas:<br>1.

Changes in sense of rights and responsibilities</div></span><span style="max-width:41%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As with cognitive development, each of these areas has a broad, well-known theory (and theorist).<br>This theory provides a framework for thinking about how the area relates to teaching.&nbsp;

though, a young infant is in no position to control or influence a

about how much to trust or mistrust the mother’s helpfulness.&nbsp;<br>It is
as if the baby asks, “If I demand food (or sleep or a clean diaper) now,
will my mother actually be able to help me meet this need?”<br>Hopefully,
between the two of them, mother and child resolve this choice in favour
of the baby's trust: the mother proves herself at least “good enough”
in her attentiveness, and the baby risks trusting mother's motivation

nearly a century, educators and psychologists have debated the nature
of intelligence, and more specifically whether intelligence is just one
broad ability or can take more than one form.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_086.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Many
classical definitions of the concept have tended to define intelligence
as a single broad ability that allows a person to solve or complete
many sorts of tasks, or at least many academic tasks like reading,
knowledge of vocabulary, and the solving of logical problems (Garlick,
2002).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There
is research evidence of such a global ability, and the idea of general
intelligence often fits with society’s everyday beliefs about
intelligence. Partly for these reasons, an entire mini-industry has
grown up around publishing tests of intelligence, academic ability, and
academic achievement.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">But
there are also problems with defining intelligence as one general
ability. One way of summing up the problems is to say that conceiving of
intelligence as something general tends to put it beyond teachers’
influence.&nbsp;

indeed similarities woven among the differences in students, but also
differences woven among students’ commonalities.&nbsp; <br>Field dependence

styles affect students’ behaviours and preferences in school and
classrooms.&nbsp;<br><br>Field dependent persons tend to work better in
groups, it seems, and to prefer “open-ended” fields of study like
literature and history.&nbsp;<br><br>Field independent persons tend to work better alone and to prefer highly analytic studies like math and science.&nbsp;<br><br>Other
cognitive styles are impulsivity and reflectivity. As the names imply,
an impulsive cognitive style is one in which a person reacts quickly,
but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is
the opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer
errors.&nbsp;

tests of general ability or of school achievement.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_086.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">More

to a common impression, students who are gifted or talented are not
necessarily awkward socially, less healthy, or narrow in their
interests-in fact, quite the contrary (Steiner &amp; Carr, 2003). They
also come from all economic and cultural groups.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Ironically,

the gifted and talented usually involves a mixture of acceleration and
enrichment of the usual curriculum (Schiever &amp; Maker, 2003).
Acceleration involves either a child skipping a class level, or else the
teacher redesigning the curriculum within a particular class level so
that more material is covered faster.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Either
strategy works, but only up to a point: children who have skipped a
class usually function well in the higher classes, both academically and
socially. Unfortunately skipping classes cannot happen repeatedly
unless the teacher, parents, and the student themselves are prepared to
live with large age and maturity differences within single classrooms.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There
is no guarantee that instruction in the new, higher-level classroom
will be any more stimulating than it was in the former, lower-level
classroom.&nbsp;<br>Redesigning the curriculum is also beneficial to the
student, but impractical to do on a widespread basis; even if teachers
had the time to redesign their programs, many non-gifted students would
be left behind as a result.

an impulsive cognitive style is one in which a person reacts quickly,
but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is
the opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer
errors.&nbsp;
<span><div><h4>Introduction to Gender Differences</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Gender
roles are the patterns of behaviours, attitudes and expectations
associated with a particular sex - with being either male or female.<br>For
clarity, psychologists sometimes distinguish gender differences, which
are related to social roles, from sex differences, which are related
only to physiology and anatomy.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:52%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Using this terminology, gender matters in teaching more than sex.&nbsp;<br>Although
there are many exceptions, boys and girls do differ on average in ways
that parallel conventional gender stereotypes and that affect how the
sexes behave at school and in class.
<span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
thinking about these differences, it should be kept in mind that they
refer to average trends and that there are numerous individual
exceptions.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Every
teacher knows of individual boys who are not athletic, for example, or
of particular girls who are especially restless in class.&nbsp;<br><br>The
individual differences mean, among other things, that it is hard to
justify providing different levels of support or resources to boys than
to girls for sports, athletics, or physical education.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
differences also suggest, though, that individual students who
contradict gender stereotypes about physical abilities may benefit from
emotional support or affirmation from teachers, simply because they may
be less likely than usual to get such affirmation from elsewhere

when relaxing socially, more often gravitate to large groups. Whether
on the playground, in a school hallway, or on the street, boys’ social
groups tend literally to fill up a lot of space, and often include
significant amounts of roughhousing as well as organised and
“semi-organised” competitive games or sports.&nbsp; <br>Girls, for their
part, are more likely to seek and maintain one or two close friends and
to share more intimate information and feelings with these individuals.&nbsp;<br><br>To
the extent that these gender differences occur, they can make girls
less visible or noticeable than boys, at least in leisure play
situations where children or youth choose their companions freely.&nbsp;

spite of most teachers’ desire to be fair to all students, it turns out
that they sometimes distribute praise and criticism differently to boys
and girls.&nbsp;The differences are summarised in the table below:</div></span><span><table><tbody><tr><td style="width:23%"><b>Types of response from teacher</b></td><td style="width:33%"><b>Boys</b></td><td style="width:43%"><b>Girls</b></td></tr><tr><td style="width:23%">Praises</td><td style="width:33%">Correct knowledge</td><td style="width:43%">"Good" or compliant behaviour</td></tr><tr><td style="width:23%">Overlooks or ignores</td><td style="width:33%">"Good" or compliant behaviour; Incorrect knowledge</td><td style="width:43%">Misbehaviour;&nbsp;Correct knowledge</td></tr><tr><td style="width:23%">Critisises</td><td style="width:33%">Misbehaviour</td><td style="width:43%">Incorrect knowledge</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_086.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
tendency is to praise boys more than girls for displaying knowledge
correctly, but to criticise girls more than boys for displaying
knowledge incorrectly (Golombok &amp; Fivush, 1994; Delamont, 1996).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Another
way of stating this difference is by what teachers tend to overlook:
with boys, they tend to overlook wrong answers, but with girls, they
tend to overlook right answers.&nbsp;<br><br>The result (which is probably
unintended) is a tendency to make boys’ knowledge seem more important
and boys themselves more competent. A second result is the other side of
this coin: a tendency to make girls’ knowledge less visible and girls
themselves less competent.

boys tend to be more active than girls, and by the same token more
restless if they have to sit for long periods. They are also more prone
than girls to rely on physical aggression if they are frustrated.<br><br>During
the first two or three years of formal school, gross motor skills
develop at almost the same average rate for boys and girls.&nbsp;<br><br>In
thinking about these gender differences, it should be kept in mind that
they refer to average trends and that there are numerous individual
exceptions.&nbsp;<br><br>There are social, academic and cognitive differences in gender roles that affect classroom life on a day-to-day basis

practice of facilitation is one of the most misunderstood notions in
the Scrum Master's responsibilities. Regardless of experience level, the
art of facilitation is a critical talent that even the most seasoned
Scrum Masters must constantly polish and hone. More often than not, a
Scrum Master's ability to help the team as an effective facilitator can
have an <b>impact on the team's overall success</b>.</div></span><span style="max-width:54%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Facilitation is <b>the
art and craft of enabling individuals and groups to discuss issues and

you want to be a great facilitator? If so, you'll need to learn
particular skills in order to become one. Unfortunately, numerous myths
about facilitation can deter you from pursuing it as a career. Some can
also cause you to focus on the wrong topics, reducing the efficacy of
your facilitation.<br>Seven key facilitation skills have been compiled in this topic to help you become a great facilit</div></span>
<span><div><h4>Master the Facilitation Mindset</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:97%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Most
facilitators struggle to master the facilitating attitude. This, in
turn, has an impact on their facilitation abilities. Keep this in mind
if you want to become a reliable facilitator: <b>"be the guide, not the hero."</b><br><b><br></b><br>Too often, facilitators believe they are <i>superior and smarter than the teams</i> they are guiding, which has a <b>negative impact on how they provide assistance</b>.
Instead of assisting a group to accomplish their best job, they
demonstrate their abilities by solving difficulties, which is not
something a facilitator should do.<b><br></b></div></span><span style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_131.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:64%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">With the correct facilitation mindset, you can become an <b>active listener</b>, tune into the requirements of your group, and ensure the process progresses quickly. This allows individuals to <i>develop their own thoughts and ask questions</i> rather than being overwhelmed by yours</div></span>
<div><div id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135gmail-page_main"><span><div><h4>Improve Time Management</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">When
workshops, meetings, and training courses go on, participants lose
interest. As a result, good facilitators ensure that the process <b>moves at the appropriate pace</b> while keeping team participation. To accomplish this, you must first understand how to <i>properly manage time</i> at a workshop, meeting, or training session.</div></span><span style="max-width:43%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">You can begin by implementing a time-boxing strategy, in which you allocate only <b>the amount of time required to accomplish a specific action</b>. For example, you may assign a quiz with a time limit of 15 to 20 minutes to participants.&nbsp;<br><br>When the timer goes off, the group must submit their quizzes, allowing you to go to the next step.</div></span><span style="max-width:48%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_154.png" alt="Timebox for Scrum Meeting Based on Sprint Length"><div> Timebox for Scrum Meeting Based on Sprint Length </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Time management not only guarantees that the momentum continues throughout the workshop, but it also <b>motivates </b>and keeps your team motivated.</div></span></div></div>
<span><div><h4>Shortcut Circular Discussions</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:55%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Circular discussions should be avoided wherever possible. Why?

<span><div><h4>Keep Energy Levels High</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Energy is essential in facilitating because it <i>enhances team engagement and ensures participants do their best</i> throughout the process. As a facilitator, you should <b>keep the energy level in the room high at all times</b>, especially if the workshop or meeting is lengthy and involves several steps.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Failure to do so results in teams becoming <i>bored, frustrated, stressed, and fatigued</i> before the process is completed.</div></span><span style="max-width:43%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">To keep energy levels high, introduce <b>physical activities</b> such as taking a five-minute walk or clapping to keep your group focused.<br><br>These
exercises stimulate the brain while providing participants with a
much-needed break from lengthy conversations and discussions.</div></span>
<span><div><h4>Limit Team Politics and Groupthink</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:36%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_068.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:55%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Meetings and workshops can easily degenerate into political debates in which <b>the most senior or loudest participant</b> wields all of the power and<b> influences the other participants</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, conversations <b>spin out of control</b>, and everyone has a different understanding of the process, affecting the ultimate outcome.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Great facilitators put an end to team politics and groupthink by <b>cultivating a collaborative environment</b> in which <i>everyone </i>shares
ideas, engages in debates, and brainstorms. They ensure that no
participant is superior to another and put an end to lengthy off-topic
arguments.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">It is crucial to recognize that handling team politics can be <i>challenging</i>, but by <b>asserting authority</b>, you can bring everyone back on course and continue the workshop or meeting

<span><div><h4>Lesson Summary</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>The <b>Definition of Done</b>
 (DoD) enforces transparency&nbsp;of the process, of the Increment, 
where we are, where we are going, and about planning a Sprint.</li><li>The "<b>Now, Next, Future</b>"&nbsp;technique can help a team create an initial DoD and improve it over time.</li><li>Tips
for creating better Sprint Goals include avoiding compound Sprint
goals, avoiding&nbsp;micromanagement with Sprint goals,&nbsp; making the Sprint
goal <b>measurable</b>, ensuring team consensus creating goals that achieve business impact, and making it focused on reducing risk.<br></li><li>Techniques that can help you get a PBI to "<b>Done</b>"
sooner include applying the DoD to every PBI, breaking PBIs down to
smaller items trying a one-day Sprint, and including the Development
Team in Product Backlog refinement.</li><li>Scrum is not designed to
help you build and release more "stuff" faster. Instead, it helps you
maximize the value you create for your customers and your organization
by frequently delivering a product, measuring the results, and then
learning and adapting to <b>wring more value out of the product</b>.<br></li><li>A
Product Owner will foster a product mindset across the organization
by&nbsp;creating alignment within the Development Team and among stakeholders
on the direction of the product and how value is defined.<br></li><li>Benefits from <b>Product Backlog refinement activities</b>
include&nbsp;Increased transparency, clarification of value, breaking things
into consumable pieces, reduction of dependencies, forecasting,
and&nbsp;Incorporation of learning.</li><li>A Product Owner ensures that there is a healthy Product Backlog of "<b>just enough</b>" refined work understood by the Development Team.</li></ul></div></span>

Students with visual impairments have difficulty seeing even with
corrective lenses. Most commonly the difficulty is related to
refraction, tunnel vision or sensitivity to light in general.&nbsp;<br>Students with visual impairments often show some of the same signs as students with simple, common nearsightedness.&nbsp;<br>The three main strategies for teaching students with hearing loss are:<br>1. Take advantage of the student’s residual hearing.<br>2. Use visual cues liberally.&nbsp;<br>3.

teachers, learning usually refers to things that happen in schools or
classrooms, even though every teacher can of course describe examples of
learning that happen outside of these places.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_192.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Teachers’ perspectives on learning often emphasize the following three ideas:<br><b>1. Curriculum content and academic achievement&nbsp;</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>2. Sequencing and readiness</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>3. The importance of transferring learning to new or future&nbsp;situations&nbsp;</b>
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Sometimes
teachers tend to emphasise whatever is taught in schools deliberately,
including both the official curriculum and the various behaviours and
routines that make classrooms run smoothly.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_086.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
practice, defining learning in this way often means that teachers
equate learning with the major forms of academic achievement -
especially language and mathematics - and to a lesser extent musical
skill, physical co-ordination or social sensitivity (Gardner, 1999,
2006).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:59%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
the classroom, there is a lot of learning that takes place alongside
the explicit learning of the curriculum. This is called incidental
learning and it occurs without the teacher or learner deliberately
trying to make it happen.&nbsp;<br>Teachers often see this incidental
learning and welcome it in their classroom.&nbsp;But their responsibility for
curriculum goals more often focuses their efforts on what students can
learn through conscious, deliberate effort.</div></span>

is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals’
observable behaviours: changes in what people say or do.&nbsp;<br>At some point we all use this perspective, whether we call it ‘behaviourism’ or something else.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbP-U4jKllJcmy0sELsvbTtRgrppEWxdM9SRC9m-L7ZAtdQcUavt1cLaf2m" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Example:&nbsp;</b><br><br>When
a person learns how to drive a car, he or she may be concerned
primarily with whether he or she can actually do the driving, not with
whether he or she can describe or explain how to drive.&nbsp;
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
the previous example about learning to drive, focusing attention on
behaviour instead of on ‘thought’ may have been desirable at that
moment, but not necessarily desirable indefinitely or all of the time.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Even
as a beginner, there are times when it is more important to be able to
describe how to do an activity rather than actually be able to do it.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:47%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Focusing
on behaviour is not necessarily less desirable than focusing on
students’ inner changes such as gains in their knowledge or their
personal attitudes.&nbsp;<br>Focusing on behaviour is merely looking at one form of learning: outward learning.&nbsp;<br>If you are teaching, you will need to attend to all forms of learning in students, whether inward or outward.&nbsp;
<span><div><h4>Operant Conditioning</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Operant
conditioning is one of many behaviourist perspectives. It focuses on
how the consequences of behaviour affect the behaviour over time. It
begins with the idea that certain consequences tend to make certain
behaviours happen more frequently.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbP-U4jKllJcmy0sELsvbTtRgrppEWxdM9SRC9m-L7ZAtdQcUavt1cLaf2m" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Example:&nbsp;</b><br>If
a teacher compliments a student for a good comment made during a
discussion, there is more of a chance that the teacher will hear further
comments from the student in the future.&nbsp;

observed the behaviour of some tame laboratory rats.&nbsp;He and his
assistants put them in a cage that only contained a lever and a tray
just big enough to hold a small amount of food.&nbsp; The image shows the
basic set-up, which is sometimes nicknamed a ‘Skinner Box’.<br><br>At
first the rat would sniff and ‘putter around’ the cage at random, but
sooner or later it would find the lever and eventually happen to press
it. The lever released a small pellet of food, which the rat would
promptly eat.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:28%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_178.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Gradually
the rat would spend more time near the lever and press the lever more
frequently, getting food more frequently.&nbsp;Eventually the rat would spend
most of its time at the lever and eating its fill of food.&nbsp;The rat had
‘discovered’ that the consequence of pressing the lever was to receive
food.&nbsp;<br>Skinner called the changes in the rat’s behaviour an example
of operant conditioning, and gave special names to the different parts
of the process.&nbsp;He called the pellets the reinforcement and the
lever-pressing the operant (because it operated on the rat’s
environment).&nbsp;

<span><div><h4>Operant Conditioning and Students’ Learning </h4></div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Since
the original research about operant conditioning used animals, it is
important to ask whether operant conditioning also describes learning in
human beings.</div></span><span style="max-width:28%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_126.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_086.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There
are countless classroom examples of consequences affecting students’
behaviour in ways that resemble operant conditioning.&nbsp;However, the
process certainly does not account for all forms of student learning

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Consider
the following examples showing operant conditioning in action. In the
examples, the operant behaviour tends to become more frequent on
repeated occasions.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbP-U4jKllJcmy0sELsvbTtRgrppEWxdM9SRC9m-L7ZAtdQcUavt1cLaf2m" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Examples:</b><br><b><br></b><br>A
young boy makes a silly face (the operant) at another child sitting
next to him. Classmates sitting around them giggle in response (the
reinforcement).<br>A child who is usually very restless sits for five
minutes doing an assignment (the operant). The teacher compliments him
for working hard (the reinforcement).</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
process of operant conditioning is widespread in classrooms - probably
more widespread than teachers realise.&nbsp;This fact makes sense, given the
nature of public education.&nbsp;<br>To a large extent, teaching is about
making certain consequences (like praise or marks) depend on students’
engaging in certain activities (like reading material or doing
assignments)</div></span>
<span><div><h4>Further Key Concepts about Operant Conditioning</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There are further key concepts associated with operant conditioning.&nbsp;<br>These
can be confusing because the ideas have names that sound rather
ordinary, but have special meanings within the framework of operant
conditioning.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:center"><b>Extinction</b><br><b>Generalisation</b><br><b>Discrimination</b><br><b>Schedule of reinforcement&nbsp;<br></b></div></span>

schedule of reinforcement refers to the pattern or frequency by which
reinforcement is linked with the operant. If a teacher praises his
student for his work, does he do it every time or only sometimes?
Frequently or only once in a while?&nbsp;<br>Behavioural psychologists found
that partial or intermittent schedules of reinforcement generally cause
learning to take longer, but also cause extinction of learning to take
longer.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:28%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_038.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">This
dual principle is important for teachers because so much of the
reinforcement they give is partial or intermittent. Typically a teacher
can compliment a student a lot of the time, but there will inevitably be
occasions when the teacher cannot do so he or she is busy elsewhere in
the classroom.&nbsp;</div></span></div></div>

main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by
mentally organising and reorganising new information or experiences.&nbsp;<br>The
 organisation happens partly by relating new experiences to prior 
knowledge that is already meaningful and well understood.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>John Dewey</b><br>John Dewey (1859-1952) is a well-known educational philosopher of the early twentieth century associated with constructivism.<br>Although
Dewey did not use the term constructivism in most of his writing, his
point of view relates strongly to constructivism. He discussed in detail
the implications of constructivism for educators.&nbsp;

birds and conversations about birds.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
assimilation and accommodation about birds and other flying objects
operate over time, the child does not just revise and add to his
vocabulary, but also adds and remembers relevant new experiences and
actions.&nbsp;From these collective revisions and additions the child
gradually constructs whole new schemata about birds, butterflies, and
other flying objects.</div></span><span style="max-width:88%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_107.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">This

involved with the learner might assist in assimilating or accommodating
information. &nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">His
theory is therefore often considered less about learning and more about

early expression of this viewpoint came from the American psychologist
Jerome Bruner (1960, 1966, 1996) who became convinced that students
could usually learn more than was traditionally expected as long as they
were given appropriate guidance and resources.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Instructional
 scaffolding is the phrase that Bruner used to describe the support that
 learners should be given as they learn.&nbsp;<br>Instructional
scaffolding literally means a temporary framework like the ones used to
construct buildings, which allows a much stronger structure to be built
within it.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Bruner
believes in the importance of providing guidance in the right way and
at the right time. When scaffolding is provided correctly, students
appear to be more competent and they learn more
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Lev Vygotsky</b><br><br>Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, proposed similar ideas to Bruner’s ideas about social constructivism.&nbsp;<br>Vygotsky’s

relationships with others who are more capable, knowledgeable or expert
than the learner.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Vygotsky
made the reasonable proposal that when a child (or novice) is learning a

accompanied and helped by an expert than if performing alone - though
still not as well as the expert.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbP-U4jKllJcmy0sELsvbTtRgrppEWxdM9SRC9m-L7ZAtdQcUavt1cLaf2m" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Example:&nbsp;</b><br><b><br></b><br>A

The relationship between learning and long-term &nbsp;development&nbsp;</b><br>In
general, psychological constructivism emphasises the way that long-term
development determines a child’s ability to learn, rather than the
other way around.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
earliest stages of a child’s life are thought to be rather self-centred
and to be dependent on the child’s sensory and motor interactions with
the environment.&nbsp;<br>When acting or reacting to his or her surroundings,
the child has relatively little language skill initially. This
circumstance limits the child’s ability to learn in the usual,
school-like sense of the term.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
development proceeds, of course, language skills improve and hence the
child becomes progressively more ‘teachable’ and in this sense more able
to learn. But whatever the child’s age, ability to learn waits or
depends upon the child’s stage of development.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">From
this point of view, a primary responsibility of teachers is to provide a
very rich classroom environment, so that children can interact with it
independently and gradually make themselves ready for verbal learning.&nbsp;
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Alternatively,
social constructivists emphasise the importance of social interaction
in stimulating the development of the child.&nbsp;<br>Language and dialogue
therefore are primary, and development is seen as happening as a result -
the converse of the sequence by psychological constructivists.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Obviously
a child does not begin life with a lot of initial language skill, but
this fact is why interactions need to be scaffolded by more experienced
experts, i.e. people capable of creating a zone of proximal development
in their conversations and other interactions.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:59%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
the preschool years, the experts are usually parents. After the child
begins school, the experts broaden to include teachers.&nbsp;<br>A teacher’s
primary responsibility is therefore to provide very rich opportunities
for dialogue, both among children and between individual children and
the teacher.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>The role of generalisations and abstractions during development</b><br>Psychological
constructivism tends to see a relatively limited role for abstract or
hypothetical reasoning in the life of children, and even in the
reasoning of youth and many adults. &nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Abstract
thinking, according to psychological constructivism, emerges relatively
slowly and relatively late in development, after a person accumulates
considerable experience. &nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Social
constructivism sees abstract thinking emerging from dialogue between a
relative novice (a child or youth) and a more experienced expert (a
parent or teacher).&nbsp;<br>The more this type of dialogue occurs, then the
more the child can acquire abstract thinking skills. The dialogue must,
of course, honour a child’s need for intellectual scaffolding or a zone
of proximal development.&nbsp;
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b> The mechanism by which development occurs</b><br><b><br></b><br>In
psychological constructivism, development is thought to happen because
of the interplay between assimilation and accommodation - between when a
child or youth can already understand or conceive of, and the change
required of that understanding by new experiences.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Acting together, assimilation and accommodation continually create new states of cognitive equilibrium.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">A
teacher can therefore stimulate development by provoking cognitive
dissonance (conflict) deliberately, e.g. by confronting a student with
sights, actions or ideas that do not fit with the student's existing
experiences and ideas.&nbsp;<br>In practice the dissonance is often
communicated verbally, by posing questions that are new or that students
may have misunderstood in the past.&nbsp;<br>Dissonance can also be provoked
through pictures or activities that are unfamiliar to students, e.g.
students could engage in community service projects that brings them in
contact with people who they had previously considered ‘strange’ or
different from themselves.

strategy that teachers often find helpful is to organise the content to

to select and devise learning activities that are better tailored to
students’ cognitive abilities and/or promote better dialogue.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">One
of the most widely used frameworks for organising content is a
classification scheme proposed by the educator Benjamin Bloom.</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_179.png" alt=""></div></span>

activities that truly target students’ zone of proximal development.

main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by
mentally organising and reorganising new information or experiences.&nbsp;<br>John Dewey is an educational philosopher of the early twentieth century associated with constructivism.<br>Jean
Piaget described learning as interplay between two mental activities
called assimilation and accommodation. For Piaget, assimilation and
accommodation work together to enrich a child’s thinking and to create
cognitive equilibrium.</div></span></div></div>
cial constructivism (or socio-cultural theory) focuses on the
relationships and interactions between a learner and other individuals
who are more knowledgeable or experienced.&nbsp;<br>Instructional scaffolding
is the phrase that the American psychologist Bruner used to describe
the support that learners should be given as they learn.&nbsp;<br>Lev
Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, proposed similar ideas to Bruner’s
ideas about social constructivism. Vygotsky’s writing focused on how a
child’s or novice’s thinking is influenced by relationships with others
who are more capable, knowledgeable or expert than the learner.&nbsp;<br>The
theoretical differences between social constructivism and psychological
constructivism are related to three ideas in particular:<br>1. The relationship between learning and long-term development of the child<br>2. The role of generalisations and abstractions during development<br>3. The mechanism by which development occurs

the reason for this is because disabilities are essentially ambiguous.&nbsp;<br>Naming
and describing ‘types’ of them implies that disabilities are relatively
fixed, stable and distinct, like different kinds of fruit or
vegetables.&nbsp;

in educational laws have affected the work of teachers by creating
three new expectations in relation to special education. These
expectations are:<br>- To provide alternative methods of assessment for students with disabilities.&nbsp;<br>- To arrange a learning environment that is as normal or as ‘least restrictive’ as possible.<br>- To participate in creating individual educational plans for students with disabilities.&nbsp;<br>In
the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to
gathering information about a student in order to identify the strengths
of the student and to decide what special educational support, if any,
the student needs.&nbsp;

learning disability is a specific impairment of academic learning that
interferes with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a
student’s academic performance significantly.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:53%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">A learning disability shows itself as a major discrepancy between a student’s ability and some feature of achievement.&nbsp;<br>The student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking or doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once.&nbsp;
<div><div id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552gmail-page_main"><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">A
learning problem is not considered a learning disability if it stems
from physical, sensory or motor handicaps or from generalised
intellectual impairment (or mental retardation).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">It
is also not a learning disability if the learning problem really
reflects the challenges of learning English as a second language.&nbsp;<br>Genuine
learning disabilities are the learning problems left over after these
other possibilities are accounted for or excluded.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Typically,
a student with a learning disability has not been helped by teachers’
ordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind
academically.&nbsp;<br>What counts as an ‘ordinary effort’, of course, differs among teachers, schools and students.&nbsp;<br>Most
importantly, though, a learning disability relates to a fairly specific
area of academic learning, e.g. a student may be able to read and
compute well enough but not be able to write.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Learning disabilities are by far the most common form of special educational need.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbP-U4jKllJcmy0sELsvbTtRgrppEWxdM9SRC9m-L7ZAtdQcUavt1cLaf2m" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Example:&nbsp;</b><br>In
the United States, learning disabilities account for half of all
students with special educational needs and anywhere from 5% to 20% of
all students, depending on how the numbers are estimated (United States
Department of Education, 2005; Ysseldyke &amp; Bielinski, 2002).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Students
with learning disabilities are so common, in fact, that most teachers
regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school year,
regardless of the class level they teach.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Defining
Learning Disabilities Clearly -&nbsp;With so many students defined as having
learning disabilities, it is not surprising that the term itself
becomes ambiguous in the truest sense of ‘having many meanings
With so many expressions of learning disabilities, it is not surprising
that educators sometimes disagree about their nature and about the kind
of help students need as a consequence.&nbsp;<br>Such controversy may be
 inevitable because learning disabilities by definition are learning 
problems with no obvious origin.&nbsp;<br>Common
to all educators though is a belief that a variety of strategies for
helping students with learning disabilities should be experimented with.

depending not only on the nature of the disability, of course, but also
on the concepts or theory of learning being used.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:59%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">This
case study looks at a girl with a learning disability called Sarah. She
adds two-digit numbers as if they were one digit numbers.&nbsp;<br>Stated
more formally, Sarah adds two-digit numbers without carrying digits

hundreds column. &nbsp;</div></span>

out of the six problems are done correctly, even though Sarah seems to
use an incorrect strategy systematically on all six problems.&nbsp;

possible approach to assist Sarah is based on the behaviourist theory.
It seems that Sarah was rewarded so much for adding single-digit numbers
(3+5, 7+8 etc.) correctly that she generalised this skill to adding
two-digit problems.&nbsp;<br>Changing Sarah’s behaviour is tricky since the
desired behaviour (borrowing correctly) rarely happens and therefore
cannot be reinforced very often. It might help for the teacher to reward
behaviours that compete directly with Sarah’s inappropriate strategy.&nbsp;<br>The
teacher might reduce credit for simply finding the correct answer and
increase credit for a student showing her the work of carrying digits
forward correctly. Or the teacher might discuss Sarah’s maths work with
Sarah frequently, so as to create more occasions when she can praise
Sarah for working problems correctly.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Reflective Learning</b><br><br>Part
of Sarah’s problem may be that she is thoughtless about doing her
maths. The minute she sees numbers on a worksheet, she stuffs them into
the first arithmetic procedure that comes to mind. Her learning style
seems too impulsive and not reflective enough.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_128.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:47%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
a solution, the teacher could encourage Sarah to think out loud when
she completes two-digit problems-literally get her to ‘talk her way
through’ each problem

Sarah has in fact learned how to carry digits forward, but not learned
the procedure well enough to use it reliably on her own.<br>In that case
her problem can be seen in the constructivist terms. Sarah has lacked
appropriate mentoring from someone more expert than herself, someone who
can create a ‘zone of proximal development’ in which she can display
and consolidate her skills more successfully.&nbsp;<br>She still needs
mentoring or ‘assisted coaching’ more than independent practice.The
teacher can arrange some of this in much the way she encourages to be
more reflective, either by working with Sarah herself or by arranging
for a classmate or even a parent volunteer to do so.&nbsp;

hearing or in vision, or more rarely in both.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_035.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:52%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">These

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Hearing Loss</b><br>A
child can acquire a hearing loss for a variety of reasons, ranging from
disease early in childhood, to difficulties during childbirth, to
reactions to toxic drugs. In the classroom, however, the cause of the
loss is virtually irrelevant because it makes little difference in how
to accommodate a student’s educational needs.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:58%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">More
important than the cause of the loss is its extent. Students with only
mild or moderate loss of hearing are sometimes called hearing impaired
or hard of hearing. Only those with nearly complete loss are called
deaf.&nbsp;<br>As with other sorts of disabilities, the milder the hearing
loss, the more likely it is that the student is in a regular classroom,
at least for part of the day.&nbsp;

how the participation structures affected classroom communication for
Kelvin Seifert as he taught one particular topic - children's play -
over a twenty-year period (2009). The topic was part of a
university-level course for future teachers.<br>During this time,
Kelvin's goals about the topic remained the same: to stimulate students'
thinking about the nature and purposes of play. But over time he tried
several different structures of participation, and students' ways of
communicating changed as a result.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_034.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">To

used this structure of participation not because he believed on

widely by his fellow university teachers.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_105.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In some ways the lecture proved&nbsp;effective:</div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Kelvin covered the material efficiently (in about 20 minutes)</li><li>He related the topic to other ones in the course</li><li>He defined and explained all key terms clearly</li><li>He did his best to relate the material to what he thought were students' own interests</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt="">
<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">ut there were also some <b>negative signs</b>. In spite of their courtesy, few students lingered after class to talk about children's play or to ask questions.<br>Worst
yet, few students chose children's play as a term paper topic, even
though it might have made a highly interesting and enjoyable one.<br>On
the final exam few seemed able to relate concepts about play to their
own experiences as teachers or leaders of recreational activities.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_105.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There was an even more <b>subtle problem</b>. The lecture about play focused overtly on a topic (play) that praised action, intrinsic motivation, and self-choice.<br>But
by presenting these ideas as a lecture, Kelvin also implied an opposite
message unintentionally: that learning is something done passively, and
that it follows an intellectual path set only by the teacher.<br>Even
the physical layout of the classroom sent this message - desks faced
forward, as if to remind students to look only at the person lecturin</div></span>

of these problems, Kelvin modified his approach after a few years of
teaching to include more asking of questions which students were invited
to answer.<br>This turned the lecture on children's play into something
more like a series of explanations of key ideas, interrupted by asking
students to express their beliefs, knowledge, or experience about
children's play.<br>Asking questions and inviting brief responses was
reassuring because it gave indications of whether students were
listening and understanding the material.<br>Questions served both to<b> motivate </b>students to listen and to<b> assess </b>how much and how well they knew the material.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In

several more years of teaching, Kelvin quit lectures altogether, even
ones interspersed with questions and answers. He began simply leading
general discussions about children’s play.<br>Instead of outlining
detailed content, he now just made concise notes that listed issues
about children’s play that students needed to consider.<br>The shift in
participation structure led to several major changes in communication
between teacher and students as well as among students.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_105.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Since students&nbsp;spoke more freely&nbsp;than before, it became easier to see whether they cared about the topic.<br>Now,

projects. Needless to say, these changes were all to the good.

found, for example, that certain students spoke more than their share
of the time - almost too freely, in fact, in effect preventing more
hesitant students from speaking.&nbsp;<br></li><li><br></li><li>Sometimes,
too, it seemed as if certain students did not listen to others’
comments, but instead just passed the time waiting for their turn to
speak, their hands propped permanently in the air.&nbsp;<br></li><li><br></li><li>Meanwhile
there were still others who passed the time apparently hoping not to
speak; they were busy doodling or staring out the window.</li><li><br></li><li>Furthermore,

control, discussions often did not cover all of the ideas about
children’s play that Kelvin considered important.&nbsp;

the time he had taught about children’s play for twenty years, Kelvin
had developed enough concerns about discussion as a communication
strategy that he shifted approach again.&nbsp;<br>This time he began using a form of <b>collaborative group work</b>:
small teams of students carrying out projects on aspects of children’s
play that interested them, making observations of children at play,
reporting on their results to the class, and writing a common report
about their work.<br>Kelvin hoped that by giving students a common focus, communication among them would improve.<br>Conversations
would deal with the tasks at hand, students would necessarily listen to
each other, and no one could afford either to dominate talk excessively
or to fall silent.</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_132.jpg" alt=""></div></span></div></div>

most teachers and students, at least when they are in a classroom and
“doing school”. (Communication outside of school is a different matter:
then teachers as well as students may speak, listen, and behave quite
differently!)&nbsp;<br>As you might suppose, the extent and balance among the
features varies depending on grade level, curriculum area, and
personalities of students or teachers. But failing to use a classroom
register at all can easily create communication problems.</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_Nbrbf3oM9qqPCAzlenkHOeDm8FiHIQsmLtjpwROGQNwxS1wwCJBuj72orOT" alt=""></div></span></div></div>

of course, is by whether the student is looking at and concentrating on
you and your comments.&nbsp;<br>But this clue is not foolproof; everyone has
had moments of staring at a speaker while daydreaming, only to realize
later that they have not heard anything that the speaker said.&nbsp;<br>It is
sometimes important, therefore, to probe more actively how much
students are&nbsp;actually understanding&nbsp;during lessons or other activities.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_190.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
explaining a new topic, for example, you can check for understanding by
asking preliminary questions connecting the topic to students’ prior
experiences and knowledge about the topic.&nbsp;<br>Note that this strategy
combines qualities of both instruction and conversation, in the sense
that it involves combining “test” questions, to which you already know
the answer, with real questions, to which you do not.

kindergarten children the teacher might reasonably ask both of the
following:</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Teacher: <i>Which of these objects that I have do you expect will sink and which ones will float?</i> (A test question - the teacher already will know the answer.)</li><li>Teacher: <i>What other things have you seen that float?

that this zone has two important features, both of which contribute to
children’s thinking. One is that it stimulates students’ thinking (by

for the student to say more.<br>In general any communication strategy
will help students become more articulate if it&nbsp;both allows and
invites&nbsp;further comment and elaboration on their ideas.&nbsp;<br>Taken
together, the invitations closely resemble a description of class
discussion, though they can actually be used singly at any time during
teaching.

A central task of teaching is to know what these are and to <b>transform </b>the most general goals into specific objectives and tasks for students.&nbsp;<br>A
lot of the clarification and specification of goals needs to happen
before a cycle of instruction actually begins, but the benefits of
planning happen throughout all phases of teaching.&nbsp;<br>If students know
precisely what they are supposed to learn, they can focus their
attention and effort more effectively. If the teacher knows precisely
what students are supposed to learn, then the teacher can make better
use of class time and choose and design assessments of their learning
that are more fair and valid. In the long run everyone benefits.<br><br>At
the most general or abstract level, the goals of education include
important philosophical ideas like “developing individuals to their
fullest potential” and “preparing students to be productive members of
society”.&nbsp;<br>Few teachers would disagree with these ideas in principle,
though they might disagree about their wording or about their relative
importance.&nbsp;<br>As a practical matter, however, teachers might have
trouble translating such generalities into specific lesson plans or
activities for the next day’s class.&nbsp;

it mean, for example, that a language arts teacher should ask students
to write an essay about their personal interests, or does it mean that
the teacher should help students learn to write as well as possible on
any topic, even ones that are not of immediate interest?&nbsp;<br>What exactly should a teacher do, from day to day, to “prepare students to be productive members of society” as well?&nbsp;<br><br>Answers
to questions like these are needed to plan instruction effectively. But

this information is referred to as the&nbsp;scope and sequence for a
curriculum. A curriculum framework document is like a standards
statement in that it does not usually provide a lot of detailed
suggestions for daily teaching.&nbsp;<br>It differs from a standards
statement, though, in that it analyzes each general standard in a
curriculum into more specific skills that students need to learn, often a
dozen or more per standard.&nbsp;<br>The language or terminology of a
framework statement also tends to be somewhat more concrete than a
standards statement, in the sense that it is more likely to name
behaviors of students - things that a teacher might see them do or hear
them say.<br>Sometimes, but not always, it may suggest ways for
assessing whether students have in fact acquired each skill listed in
the document.

skills. Note also that the excerpt names observable <b>behaviors </b>of students. Click on the following tabs to explore a curriculum framework.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><i>Extract

curriculum frameworks and guides like the ones described previously,
how do you choose and formulate actual learning objectives?&nbsp;<br>Basically there are two approaches:<br>Start by selecting topics that you want students <b>to know</b> (the cognitive approach)<br>Start with what you want students<b> to do </b>(the behavioral approach)<br>In
effect the cognitive approach moves from the general to the specific,
and the behavioral approach does the opposite. Each approach has
advocates, as well as inherent strengths and problems. In practice,
teachers often combine or alternate between them in order to give
students some of the advantages of each.
<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">onsider

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Using a strictly cognitive approach to planning, therefore, a teacher’s job has two parts.&nbsp; First she must<b> identify</b>,
find, or choose a manageable number of general goals - perhaps a half
dozen or so. (Sometimes these can be taken or adapted from a curriculum
framework document.)&nbsp;<br>Then the teacher must think of a handful of <b>specific examples</b>
or behavioral indicators for each goal - a half dozen or so of these as
well. The behavioral indicators clarify the meaning of the general
goal, but are not meant to be the only way that students might show
success at learning.<br>Then, at last, <b>thoughtful planning</b> for individual lessons or activities can begin.&nbsp;<br>This approach works especially well for learning goals that are <b>relatively long-term</b>,
that is, goals that take many lessons, days, or weeks to reach. During
such long periods of teaching, it is impossible to specify the exact,
detailed behaviors that every student can or should display to prove
that he or she has reached a general goal.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">It

<span><div><h4>Bloom's Taxonomy</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
levels form a loose hierarchy from simple to complex thinking, at least
when applied to some subjects and topics. When planning for these
subjects it can therefore be helpful not only for insuring diversity
among learning objectives, but also for sequencing materials.&nbsp;<br>In
learning about geography, for example, it may sometimes make sense to
begin with information about specific places or societies (knowledge and
comprehension), and work gradually toward comparisons and assessments
among the places or societies (analysis and synthesis).</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_027.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Such
a sequence does not work well, however, for all possible topics or
subjects. To learn certain topics in mathematics, for example, students
may sometimes need to start with general ideas (like “What does it mean
to multiply?”) than with specific facts (like “How much is 4 x 6?”)
(Egan, 2005).&nbsp;<br><br>At other times, though, the reverse sequence may
be preferable. Whatever the case, a taxonomy of cognitive objectives,
like Bloom’s, can help to remind teachers to set a variety of objectives
and to avoid relying excessively on just one level, such as simple
recall of factual knowledge (Notar, et al., 200</div></span>

far variety among students has been ignored. Yet their diversity is a
reality that every teacher recognizes. Whatever goals and plans are
made, some students learn the material sooner or better than others. <br>For
any given goal or objective, some students need more time than others
in order to learn. And any particular teaching strategy will prove more
effective with some students than others.&nbsp;<br><br>Effective teaching
requires&nbsp;differentiated instruction&nbsp;- providing different materials,
arrangements, and strategies with different students. The
differentiation can include unique structural arrangements in the
school, such as special tutoring for individuals or special classes for
small groups needing particular extra help.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Differentiation

of the more widely used approaches for differentiating instruction is
called response to intervention (or RTI). Like other forms of
differentiation, RTI begins with the premise that students differ widely
in how they learn and the extent of their learning.&nbsp; <br>It also
assumes that a central part of teaching is to respond to these
differences, and to do so as promptly as possible. To achieve this
purpose, RTI programs typically frame educational interventions around
three levels called tiers. Click on the following tabs to further

discussion of instructional planning so far has described goals and
objectives as if they are selected primarily by educators and teachers,
and not by students themselves. The assumption may be correct in many
cases, but there are problems with it.&nbsp;<br>One problem is that choosing
goals and objectives for students, rather than by students, places a
major burden on everyone involved in education - curriculum writers,
teachers, and students.<br><br>The curriculum writers have to make sure
that they specify standards, goals, and objectives that are truly
important for students to learn (what if it really does not matter, for
example, whether a science student learns about the periodic table of
the elements?).&nbsp;<br><br>Teachers have to make sure that students
actually become motivated to learn the specified goals and objectives,
even if the students are not motivated initially.&nbsp;<br>Students have to master pre-set goals and objectives even if they might not have chosen them personally.&nbsp;

critics of education have argued that these requirements can be serious
impediments to learning (Kohn, 2004). The problems are widespread and
especially noticeable in two forms of teaching.&nbsp;<br>One is with the
youngest students, who may especially lack patience with an educational
agenda set by others (Kohn, 1999; Seitz, 2006).&nbsp;<br>The other is with
culturally diverse classrooms, where students and their families may
hold a variety of legitimate, but unconventional expectations about what
they should learn (J. Banks &amp; C. Banks, 2005).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
response to concerns like these, some educators advocate planning
instruction around goals set or expressed either by students themselves
or by the cultures or communities with which students identify.&nbsp;<br>Their suggestions vary in detail, but can be organized into two broad categories:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Emergent Curriculum

is an all-encompassing set of values, beliefs, practices and customs of
a group or community - its total way of life. Cultures may be shared
widely, even by much if not all of an entire nation, or they may be
shared by relatively few, such as a small community within a large
city.&nbsp;<br>Sometimes the term culture is even applied to the way of life
of an individual family or of a specialized group in society; some might
argue, for example, that there is a culture of schooling shared by
teachers, though not necessarily by all students.

that individuals will be punctual (or on time), whereas in others

succeed instructional plans require a variety of resources, like the
ones discussed in the previous module. But they also require more: they
need to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;with students’ prior experiences and knowledge.<br><br>Sometimes
the connections can develop as a result of using the Internet, taking
field trips, or engaging in service learning, particularly if students
are already familiar with these activities and places.&nbsp;<br>More often
than not, though, teachers need to find additional ways to connect
curriculum with students’ experiences - ways that fit more thoroughly
and continuously into the daily work of a class.</div></span>
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Fortunately,
such techniques are readily at hand; they simply require the teacher to
develop a habit of looking for opportunities to use them.&nbsp;<br>Among the possibilities are four that deserve special mention:&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Modeling behavior and modeling representations of ideas.</li><li>Activating prior knowledge already familiar to students.<br></li><li>Anticipating preconceptions held by students.<br></li><li>Providing guided and independent practice.<br></li></ul></div></span><span><div><h4>Modeling</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The

meanings can link </div></span>

desired new behavior or skill, as when a teacher or classmate
demonstrates polite behaviors or the correct solution to a math
problem.&nbsp;<br>In this case the teacher or classmate models the desired
behavior, either deliberately or in the course of other ongoing
activity. Students observe the modeled behavior and (hopefully) imitate
it themselves.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Research
repeatedly shows that modeling desired behaviors is an effective way to
learn new behaviors, especially when the model is perceived as
important (like the teacher), similar to the learner (like a student’s
best friend), or has a warm, positive relationship with the learner
(like the teacher or the student’s friend) (Bandura, 2002; Gibson,
2004).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Modeling

term that refers to encouraging students to recall what they know
already about new material being learned. Various formats for activating
prior knowledge are possible.&nbsp;<br>When introducing a unit about how
biologists classify animal and plant species, for example, a teacher can
invite students to discuss how they already classify different kinds of
plants and animals.<br>Having highlighted this informal knowledge, the
teacher can then explore how the same species are classified by
biological scientists, and compare the scientists’ classification
schemes to the students’ own schemes.&nbsp;<br>The activation does not have
to happen orally, as in the previous example; a teacher can also ask
students to write down as many distinct types of animals and plants that
they can think of, and then ask students to diagram or map their
relationships - essentially creating a concept map.&nbsp;<br>Whatever the
strategy used, activation helps by making students’ prior knowledge or
experience conscious and therefore easier to link to new concepts or
information.</div></span></div></div>

and ideas from students’ lives has been the main focus.&nbsp;<br>In studying
human growth in a health class, for example, a teacher might ask
students to bring photos of themselves as a much younger child. In this

learning to self-regulated learning - or put differently, from practice
that is relatively guided to practice that is relatively independent.

to the student’s outward behaviors. This is the perspective of
behaviorism, which is sometimes used as a way to think about the
learning process.<br>In its most thorough-going form, behaviorism
focuses almost completely on what can be directly seen or heard about a
person’s behavior, and has relatively few comments about what may lie
behind (or “underneath” or “inside”) the behavior.<br>When it comes to
motivation, this perspective means minimizing or even ignoring the
distinction between the inner drive or energy of students, and the
outward behaviors that express the drive or energy. The two are
considered the same, or nearly so.<br>Equating the inner and the outward
might seem to violate common sense. How can a student do something
without some sort of feeling or thought to make the action happen?<br>This
very question has led to alternative models of motivation that are
based on cognitive rather than behaviorist theories of learning.
However, considering the advantages of a behaviorist perspective on

the circumstances of teaching can limit teachers’ opportunities to

the multiple demands of teaching can limit the time needed to determine
what the behaviors mean. If a student asks a lot of questions during
discussions, for example, is he or she curious about the material
itself, or just wanting to look intelligent in front of classmates and
the teacher?&nbsp;<br>In a class with many students and a busy agenda, there
may not be a lot of time for a teacher to decide between these
possibilities. In other cases, the problem may not be limited time as
much as communication difficulties with a student.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Consider
a student who is still learning English, or who belongs to a cultural
community that uses patterns of conversation that are unfamiliar to the

for example, that a student learns by operant conditioning to answer
questions during class discussions: each time the student answers a

you can also think of it in terms of motivation: the likelihood of the
student answering questions (the motivation) is increasing because of

<span><div><h4>Cautions about Behavioral Perspectives on Motivation</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
was mentioned, behaviorist perspectives about motivation do reflect a
classroom reality: that teachers sometimes lack time and therefore must
focus simply on students’ appropriate outward behavior. But there are
nonetheless cautions about adopting this view.</div></span><span style="max-width:17%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:71%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">An
obvious one is the&nbsp;ambiguity&nbsp;of students’ specific behaviors; what
looks like a sign of one motive to the teacher may in fact be a sign of
some other motive to the student (DeGrandpre, 2000).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>If
a student looks at the teacher intently while she is speaking, does it
mean the student is motivated to learn, or only that the student is

the teacher, or that student comes from a family or cultural group where

concern about behaviorist perspectives, including operant conditioning,
is that it leads teachers to ignore students’ choices and preferences,
and to “play God” by making choices on their behalf (Kohn, 1996).</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">According
to this criticism, the distinction between “inner” motives and
expressions of motives in outward behavior does not disappear just
because a teacher (or a psychological theory) chooses to treat a motive
and the behavioral expression of a motive as equivalent
<span style="max-width:76%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">tudents
usually do know what they want or desire, and their wants or desires
may not always correspond to what a teacher chooses to reinforce or
ignore. This is the issue of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.
Approaches that are exclusively behavioral, it is argued, are not
sensitive enough to students’ intrinsic, self-sustaining motivations.</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">There
is truth to this allegation if a teacher actually does rely on
rewarding behaviors that she alone has chosen, or even if she persists
in reinforcing behaviors that students already find motivating without
external reinforcement.&nbsp;<br><br>In those cases reinforcements can
backfire: instead of serving as an incentive to desired behavior,
reinforcement can become a reminder of the teacher’s power and of
students’ lack of control over their own actions.&nbsp;
<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">
classic research study of intrinsic motivation illustrated the problem
nicely. In the study, researchers rewarded university students for two
activities - solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines - that they
already found interesting. Some of the students, however, were paid to
do these activities, whereas others were not.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:76%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Under
these conditions, the students who were paid were less likely to engage
in the activities following the experiment than were the students who
were not paid, even though both groups had been equally interested in
the activities to begin with (Deci, 1971).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The extrinsic reward of payment, it seemed, interfered with the intrinsic reward of working the puzz

way motives vary is by the kind of goals that students set for
themselves, and by how the goals support students’ academic
achievement.&nbsp;<br>As you might suspect, some goals encourage academic

main concern is to learn the material as well as possible because she
finds it interesting and because she believes it will be useful to her
in later courses, perhaps at university. Hers is a <b>mastery goal</b> because she wants primarily to learn or master the material.&nbsp;
<span><div><h4>Goals that Contribute to Motivation</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As you might imagine, mastery, performance, and performance-avoidance goals often are not experienced in pure form, but in <b>combinations.</b><br>If
you play the clarinet in the school band, you might want to improve
your technique simply because you enjoy playing as well as possible -
essentially a mastery orientation. But you might also want to look
talented in the eyes of classmates - a performance orientation. Another
part of what you may wish, at least privately, is to avoid looking like a
complete failure at playing the clarinet.<br>One of these motives may predominate over the others, but they all may be present.

goals tend to be associated with enjoyment of learning the material at
hand, and in this sense represent an outcome that teachers often seek
for students. By definition therefore they are a form of <b>intrinsic motivation</b>.&nbsp;<br>As such mastery goals have been found to be better than performance goals at sustaining students’ interest in a subject.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_027.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
one review of research about learning goals, for example, students with
primarily mastery orientations toward a course they were taking not
only tended to express greater interest in the course, but also
continued to express interest well beyond the official end of the
course, and to enroll in further courses in the same subject
(Harackiewicz, et al., 2002; Wolters, 2004).

goals, on the other hand, imply extrinsic motivation, and tend to show
the mixed effects of this orientation. A positive effect is that
students with a performance orientation do tend to get higher grades
than those who express primarily a mastery orientation.&nbsp; <br>The
advantage in grades occurs both in the short term (with individual
assignments) and in the long term (with overall grade point average when
graduating).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">But
there is evidence that performance-oriented students do not actually
learn material as deeply or permanently as students who are more mastery
oriented (Midgley, Kaplan, &amp; Middleton, 2001).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">A
possible reason is that measures of performance - such as test scores -
often reward relatively shallow memorization of information and
therefore guide performance-oriented students away from processing the
information thoughtfully or deeply.<br>Another possible reason is that a
performance orientation, by focusing on gaining recognition as the best
among peers, encourages competition among peers. Giving and receiving
help from classmates is thus not in the self-interest of a
performance-oriented student, and the resulting isolation limits the
student’s learning.
<span><div><h4>ncouraging Mastery Goals</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Even
though a degree of performance orientation may be inevitable in school
because of the mere presence of classmates, it does not have to take
over students’ academic motivation completely.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Teachers
can encourage mastery goals in various ways, and should in fact do so
because a mastery orientation leads to more sustained, thoughtful
learning, at least in classrooms, where classmates may sometimes debate
and disagree with each other (Darnon, Butera, &amp; Harackiewicz, 2006).</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">How
can teachers do so? One way is to allow students to choose specific
tasks or assignments for themselves, where possible, because their
choices are more likely than usual to reflect prior personal interests,
and hence be motivated more intrinsically than usual.&nbsp;<br>The limitation
of this strategy, of course, is that students may not see some of the
connections between their prior interests and the curriculum topics at
hand. In that case it also helps for the teacher to look for and point
out the relevance of current topics or skills to students’ personal
interests and goals.

was mentioned, failure-avoidant goals by nature undermine academic
achievement. Often they are a negative byproduct of the competitiveness
of performance goals (Urdan, 2004).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">If
a teacher (and sometimes also fellow students) put too much emphasis on
being the best in the class, and if interest in learning the material
as such therefore suffers, then some students may decide that success is
beyond their reach or may not be desirable in any case. The alternative
- simply avoiding failure - may seem wiser as well as more feasible.<br><br>Once
a student adopts this attitude, he or she may underachieve more or less
deliberately, doing only the minimum work necessary to avoid looking
foolish or to avoid serious conflict with the teacher.&nbsp;<br>Avoiding failure in this way is an example of <b>self-handicapping</b>
- deliberate actions and choices that the reduce chances of success.
Students may self-handicap in a number of ways; in addition to not
working hard, they may procrastinate about completing assignments, for
example, or set goals that are unrealistically high.
<span><div><h4>Social Goals</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Most
students need and value relationships, both with classmates and with
teachers, and often (though not always) they get a good deal of positive
support from the relationships. But the effects of social relationships
are complex, and at times can work both for and against academic
achievement.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">If
a relationship with the teacher is important and reasonably positive,
then the student is likely to try pleasing the teacher by working hard
on assignments (Dowson &amp; Mclnerney, 2003). Note, though, that this
effect is closer to performance than mastery; the student is primarily
concerned about looking good to someone else.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_105.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">If,
on the other hand, a student is especially concerned about
relationships with peers, the effects on achievement depend on the
student’s motives for the relationship, as well as on peers’ attitudes.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Desiring
to be close to peers personally may lead a student to ask for help
from, and give help to peers - a behavior that may support higher
achievement, at least up to a point.&nbsp;<br>But desiring to impress peers with skills and knowledge may lead to the oppo
<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
abilities and achievement motivation of peers themselves can also make a
difference, but once again the effects vary depending on the context.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Low
achievement and motivation by peers affects an individual’s academic
motivation more in elementary school than in high school, more in
learning mathematics than learning to read, and more if there is a wide
range of abilities in a classroom than if there is a more narrow range
(Burke &amp; Sass, 2006).</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
spite of these complexities, social relationships are valued so highly
by most students that teachers should generally facilitate them, though
also keep an eye on their nature and their consequent effects on
achievement. Many assignments can be accomplished productively in
groups, for example, as long as the groups are formed thoughtfully.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Relationships
can also be supported with activities that involve students or adults
from another class or from outside the school, as often happens with
school or community service projects. These can provide considerable
social satisfaction and can sometimes be connected to current curriculum
needs (Butin, 2005).&nbsp;
<span><div><h4>The main points from this module are as follows:</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>Behaviorism: </b>thinking of motivation not as something “inside” a student driving their behavior, but as equivalent to their outward behavior.</li><li><b>Operant conditioning</b>
can be reframed in terms of motivation, by thinking of answering the
question as the motivation, and of the teacher as the motivator.&nbsp;</li><li>If teaching from the<b> behaviorist perspective</b>,
it is important to remember that what looks like a sign of one motive
to the teacher may easily be a sign of a different motive to the
student.<br></li><li>As <b>extrinsic rewards</b> often seem to undermine intrinsic motivation, they should be used selectively and thoughtfully.<br></li><li><b>Mastery goals </b>are a form of intrinsic motivation, when a student wishes to learn or master new material.<br></li><li><b>Performance goals</b>
are a form of extrinsic motivation, when a student wishes to look
successful, and perform well in the eyes of peers and teachers.

addition to holding different kinds of goals - with consequent
differences in academic motivation - students show obvious differences
in levels of interest in the topics and tasks of the classroom.&nbsp;<br>Suppose
that two high school classmates, Frank and Jason, both are taking
chemistry, and specifically learning how to balance chemical equations.

As the example implies, when students learn from interest they tend to
devote more attention to the topic than if they learn from effort (Hidi
&amp; Renninger, 2006).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
 finding is not surprising since interest is another aspect 
of&nbsp;intrinsic motivation&nbsp;- energy or drive that comes from 
within.<br>A
distinction between effort and interest is often artificial, however,
because the two motives often get blended or combined in students’
personal experiences.&nbsp;<br>Most people can remember times when they
worked at a skill that they enjoyed and found interesting, but that also
required effort to learn. The challenge for teachers is therefore to
draw on and encourage students’ interest as much as possible, and thus
keep the required effort within reasonable bounds - neither too hard nor
too easy.</div></span></div></div>
<span><div><h4>Situational Interest versus Personal Interest</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Students’ interests vary in how deeply or permanently they are located within students.<b> Situational interests</b>
are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate
situation. Unusual sights, sounds, or words can stimulate situational
interest. <br>A teacher might show an interesting image on the overhead
projector, or play a brief bit of music, or make a surprising comment in
passing. At a more abstract level, unusual or surprising topics of
discussion can also arouse interest when they are first introduced.</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_112.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Personal interests</b>&nbsp;are
relatively permanent preferences of the student, and are usually
expressed in a variety of situations. In the classroom, a student may
(or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities,
or subject matter.&nbsp;<br>Outside class, though, he or she usually has
additional personal interests in particular no
<span><div><h4>Benefits of Personal Interest</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
general, personal interest in an academic topic or activity tends to
correlate with achievement related to the topic or activity.</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
you might suppose, a student who is truly interested is more likely to
focus on the topic or activity more fully, to work at it for longer
periods, to use more thoughtful strategies in learning - and to enjoy
doing so (Hidi, 2001; Hidi &amp; Renninger, 2006). Small wonder that the
student achieves more!&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Note, though, a <b>persistent ambiguity</b>
about this benefit: it is often not clear whether personal interest
leads to higher achievement, or higher achievement leads to stronger
interest. Either possibility seems plausible. Research to sort them out,
however, has suggested that at least some of the influence goes in the
direction from interest to achievement.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">When

(e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend

<span><div><h4>Motives Related to Attributions</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Attributions
are perceptions about the causes of success and failure. Suppose that
you get a low mark on a test and are wondering what caused the low
mark.&nbsp;<br>You can construct various explanations for - make various
attributions about - this failure. Maybe you did not study very hard;
maybe the test itself was difficult; maybe you were unlucky; maybe you
just are not smart enough.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:16%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:71%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Each
explanation attributes the failure to a different factor. The
explanations that you settle upon may reflect the truth accurately - or
then again, they may not. What is important about attributions is that
they reflect personal beliefs about the sources or causes of success and

about the student’s personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the
beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation (Bandura,
1977, 1986, 1997).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Self-efficacy</b>
is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or
of reaching a specific goal. Note that the belief and the action or goal
are specific.&nbsp;<br>Self-efficacy is a belief that you can write an
acceptable term paper, for example, or repair an automobile, or make
friends with the new student in class. These are relatively specific
beliefs and tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Self-efficacy is not about whether you believe
that you are intelligent in general, whether you always like working
with mechanical things, or think that you are generally a likeable
person.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">These
more general judgments are better regarded as various mixtures of
self-concepts (beliefs about general personal identity) or of
self-esteem (evaluations of identity). They are important in their own
right, and sometimes influence motivation, but only indirectly (Bong

They are <b>self-constructed</b>, meaning that they are personally developed perceptions.&nbsp;<br>There
can sometimes therefore be discrepancies between a person’s
self-efficacy beliefs and the person’s abilities. You can believe that
you can write a good term paper, for example, without actually being
able to do so, and vice versa: you can believe yourself incapable of
writing a paper, but discover that you are in fact able to do so.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In

possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy. The
optimum level seems to be either at or slightly above true capacity
(Bandura, 1997). Large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability
can create motivational problems for the individual.

may sound like a uniformly desirable quality, but research as well as
teachers’ experience suggests that its effects are a bit more
complicated than they first appear.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Self-efficacy has three main effects, each of which has both a “dark” or undesirable side and a positive or desirable side:</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_112.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Choice of tasks</li><li>Persistence at tasks

first effect is that self-efficacy makes students more willing to
choose tasks where they already feel confident of succeeding. This
effect is almost inevitable, given the definition of the concept of
self-efficacy, it has also been supported by research on self-efficacy
beliefs (Pajares &amp; Schunk, 2001).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">For
teachers, the effect on choice can be either welcome or not, depending
on circumstances. If a student believes that he or she can solve
mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the
mathematics homework that the teacher assigns.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately the
converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is
incapable of math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math
homework (perhaps telling himself, “What’s the use of trying?”),
regardless of the student’s actual ability in math.
<span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">nce
self-efficacy is self-constructed, furthermore, it is also possible for
students to miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and the
misperceptions themselves can have complex effects on students’
motivations.&nbsp;<br>From a teacher’s point of view, all is well even if
students overestimate their capacity but actually do succeed at a
relevant task anyway, or if they underestimate their capacity, yet
discover that they can succeed and raise their self-efficacy beliefs as a
result.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">All
may not be well, though, if students do not believe that they can
succeed and therefore do not even try, or if students overestimate their
capacity by a wide margin, but are disappointed unexpectedly by failure
and lower their self-efficacy beliefs.
<span><div><h4>Persistence at Tasks</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:23%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_155.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">A second effect of high self-efficacy is to increase a <b>persistence</b>
at relevant tasks. If you believe that you can solve crossword puzzles,
but encounter one that takes longer than usual, then you are more
likely to work longer at the puzzle until you (hopefully) really do
solve it.<br><br>This is probably a desirable behavior in many
situations, unless the persistence happens to interfere with other, more
important tasks (what if you should be doing homework instead of
working on crossword puzzles?).<br><br>If you happen to have low
self-efficacy for crosswords, on the other hand, then you are more
likely to give up early on a difficult puzzle.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Giving
up early may often be undesirable because it deprives you of a chance
to improve your skill by persisting. Then again, the consequent lack of
success because of giving up may provide a useful </div></span>

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
with choosing tasks, the effects of self-efficacy vary from one
individual to another and one situation to another. The teacher’s task

helplessness was originally studied from the behaviorist perspective of
classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman
(1995).<br>The studies used a somewhat “gloomy” experimental procedure
in which an animal, such as a rat or a dog, was repeatedly shocked in a
cage in a way that prevented the animal from escaping the shocks.&nbsp;<br>In
a later phase of the procedure, conditions were changed so that the
animal could avoid the shocks by merely moving from one side of the cage
to the other. Yet frequently they did not bother to do so! Seligman
called this behavior learned helplessness.

<span><div><h4>The main points from this module are as follows:</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>Self-efficacy</b> is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal.</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Three&nbsp;main<b> effects</b>&nbsp;of self-efficacy &nbsp;are:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ol><li><b>Choice of tasks</b>&nbsp;- self-efficacy makes students more willing to choose tasks where they already feel confident of succeeding</li><li><b>Persistence at tasks</b>&nbsp;- self-efficacy increases &nbsp;persistence at relevant tasks</li><li><b>Response to failure&nbsp;</b>-

helplessness is a perception of complete lack of control in mastering a

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">he main <b>sources</b> of self-efficacy are:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Prior experiences of mastering tasks</li><li>Watching others’ mastering tasks</li><li>Messages or “persuasion” from others</li><li>Emotions related to stress and discomfort<br></li><li>These can be influenced by teachers.</li></ul></div></span>

sense suggests that human motivations originate from some sort of inner
“need”. Everyone thinks of themselves as having various “needs”, a need
for food, for example, or a need for companionship - that influence
their choices and activities.&nbsp; <br>This same idea also forms part of
some theoretical accounts of motivation, though the theories differ in
the needs that they emphasize or recognize</div></span>
<span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">For example,<b> Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</b>
can be seen as an illustration of motivations that function like needs
which influence long-term personal development. According to Maslow,
individuals must satisfy physical survival needs before they seek to
satisfy needs of belonging, they satisfy belonging needs before esteem
needs, and so on.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
theory, too, people have both deficit needs and growth needs, and the
deficit needs must be satisfied before growth needs can influence
behavior (Maslow, 1970).</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_063.png" alt="">

recent theory of motivation based on the idea of needs
is&nbsp;self-determination theory,&nbsp;proposed by the psychologists Edward Deci
and Richard Ryan (2000), among others.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The theory proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_190.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Autonomy - &nbsp;the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior<br></li><li>Competence - the need to feel capable or skilled<br></li><li>Relatedness - the need to feel connected or involved with others<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Note
that these needs are all psychological, not physical; hunger, for
example, is not on the list. They are also about personal growth or
development, not about deficits that a person tries to reduce or
eliminate.&nbsp; <br>Unlike food (in behaviorism) or safety (in Maslow’s
hierarchy), you can never get enough of autonomy, competence, or
relatedness. You (and your students) will seek to enhance these
continually throughout life.

key idea of self-determination theory is that when persons (such as you
or one of your students) feel that these basic needs are reasonably
well met, they tend to perceive their actions and choices to be
intrinsically <b>motivated or “self-determined”.&nbsp;</b></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
that case they can turn their attention to a variety of activities that
they find attractive or important, but that do not relate directly to
their basic needs. Among your students, for example, some individuals
might read books that you have suggested, and others might listen
attentively when you explain key concepts from the unit that you happen
to be teaching.&nbsp;<br>If one or more basic needs are not met well,
however, people will tend to feel coerced by outside pressures or
external incentives. They may become preoccupied, in fact, with
satisfying whatever need has not been met and thus exclude or avoid
activities that might otherwise be interesting, educational, or
important. If the persons are students, their learning will suffer.
<span><div><h4>Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
principle, a student can experience self-determination even if the
student must, for example, live within externally imposed rules of
appropriate classroom behavior. To achieve a feeling of
self-determination, however, the student’s basic needs must be met -
needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. <br>In motivating
students, then, the bottom line is that teachers have an interest in
helping students to meet their basic needs, and in not letting school
rules or the teachers’ own leadership styles interfere with or block
satisfaction of students’ basic needs.

may be the ideal for most teachers and students, of course, but the
reality is usually different. For a variety of reasons, teachers in most
classrooms cannot be expected to meet all students’ basic needs at all
times.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>One reason is the sheer number of students, which makes it impossible to attend to every student perfectly at all times.&nbsp;</li><li>Another
reason is teachers’ responsibility for a curriculum, which can require
creating expectations for students’ activities that sometimes conflict
with students’ autonomy or makes them feel (temporarily) less than fully
competent.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Still another reason is students’ personal
histories, ranging from divorce to poverty, which may create needs in
some individuals which are beyond the power of teachers to remedy.<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The result from<b> students’ point of view</b>
is usually only a partial perception of self-determination, and
therefore a simultaneous mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.</div></span><span style="max-width:17%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:71%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Self-determination theory recognizes this reality by suggesting that the

<span><div><h4>Using Self-Determination Theory in the Classroom</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">What
are some teaching strategies for supporting students’ needs?
Educational researchers have studied this question from a variety of
directions, and their resulting recommendations converge and overlap in a
number of ways.&nbsp;<br>For convenience, the recommendations can be grouped according to the basic need that they address:</div></span><span style="max-width:17%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_112.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:65%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Supporting autonomy in learners</li><li>Supporting the need for competence</li><li>Supporting the need to relate to other

major part of supporting autonomy is to give students choices wherever
possible (Ryan &amp; Lynch, 2003). The choices that encourage the
greatest feelings of self-control, obviously, are ones that are about
relatively major issues or that have relatively significant consequences
for students, such as whom to choose as partners for a major group
project.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">But
choices also encourage some feeling of self-control even when they are
about relatively minor issues, such as how to organize your desk or what
kind of folder to use for storing your papers at school.&nbsp;<br><br>It is
important, furthermore, to offer choices to all students, including
students needing explicit directions in order to work successfully;
avoid reserving choices for only the best students or giving up offering
choices altogether to students who fall behind or who need extra help.&nbsp;<br>All students will feel more self-determined and therefore more motivated if they have choices of some sort.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Teachers can also support students’ autonomy more directly by<b> minimizing external rewards </b>(like
grades) and comparisons among students’ performance, and by orienting
and responding themselves to students’ expressed goals and interests.<br>In
teaching elementary students about climate change, for example, you can
support autonomy by exploring which aspects of this topic have already
come to students’ attention and aroused their concern.</div></span><span style="max-width:64%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The point of the discussion would not be to find out “who knows the most” about this topic, but to<b> build and enhance </b>students’ intrinsic motivations as much as possible.&nbsp;<br>In
reality, of course, it may not be possible to succeed at this goal
fully - some students may simply have no interest in the topic, for
example, or you may be constrained by time or resources from
individualizing certain activities fully.&nbsp;<br>But any degree of attention to students’ individuality, as well as any degree of choice, will support students’ autonomy.
<span><div><h4>Supporting the Need for Competence</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:76%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting
activities which are challenging but nonetheless achievable with
reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, &amp; Thrash,
2004).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Although
few teachers would disagree with this idea, there are times when it is
hard to put into practice, such as when you first meet a class at the
start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar with their
backgrounds and interests.&nbsp;<br>But there are some strategies that are

most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting
activities which are challenging but nonetheless achievable with
reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, &amp; Thrash,
2004).&nbsp;<br>Although few teachers would disagree with this idea, there
are times when it is hard to put into practice, such as when you first
meet a class at the start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar
with their backgrounds and interests

It proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:<br></li><li><b>Autonomy -</b> the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior<br></li><li><b>Competence -</b> the need to feel capable or skilled<br></li><li><b>Relatedness </b>- the need to feel connected or involved with others<br></li><li>According

value of a task is assessed by its importance, interest to the student,
usefulness or utility, and the cost in terms of effort and time to
achieve it.&nbsp;<br>Expectation of success is assessed by a student's
perception of the difficulty of a task. Generally a middling level of
difficulty is optimal for students; too easy, and the task seems trivial
(not valuable or meaningful), and too hard, and the task seems unlikely
to succeed and in this sense useless.&nbsp;<br>Authenticity refers to how
much a task relates to real-life experiences of students; the more it
does so, the more it can build on students' interests and goals, and the
more meaningful and motivating it becomes.

as its name implies, is about administrative rules or routines needed
to accomplish tasks in a classroom. It happens, for example, when the
teacher says, <i>“When you are done with your spelling books, put them in the bins at the side of the room”</i>, or when a student asks, <i>“Do you want us to print our names at the top of page?"</i></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_151.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Procedural
talk provides information that students need to coordinate their
activities in what can be a relatively crowded space - the classroom -
and under conditions in which time may be relatively short or tightly
scheduled. It generally keeps activities organized and flowing
smoothly.&nbsp;<br>Procedural talk is not primarily about removing or
correcting unwanted behavior, although certain administrative procedures
might sometimes annoy a particular student, or students might sometimes
forget to follow a procedure.&nbsp;<br>Instead it is intended to provide the guidance that students need to coordinate with each other and with the teacher.
<span><div><h4>Control Talk</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><b>Control talk</b>
is about preventing or correcting misbehaviors when they occur,
particularly when the misbehaviors are not because of ignorance of
procedures. It happens, for example, when a teacher says, <i>“Jill, you were talking when you should have been listening”,</i> or <i>“Jason, you need to work on your math instead of doodling.</i>”</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_109.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Most
control talk originates with the teacher, but students sometimes engage
in it with each other, if not with the teacher. One student may look at
a nearby classmate who is whispering out of turn and quietly say,&nbsp;<i>“Shhh!”</i>&nbsp;in an attempt to silence the behavior. Or a student may respond to being teased by a classmate by saying simply,&nbsp;<i>“Stop it!”&nbsp;</i><br>Whether
originating from the teacher or a student, control talk may not always
be fully effective. But its purpose is, by definition, to influence or
control inappropriate behavio</div></span>

with the third, control talk, in the same remark or interaction. For
example, a teacher may ask a content-related question as a form of
control talk.<br>She may, for example, ask,&nbsp;<i>“Jeremy, what did you think of the film we just saw?”</i>&nbsp;The
question is apparently about content, but the teacher may also be
trying to end Jeremy’s daydreaming and to get him back on task - an
example of control talk.&nbsp;<br><br>Or a teacher may state a rule:&nbsp;<i>“When one person is talking, others need to be listening.”</i>&nbsp;The rule is procedural in that it helps to coordinate classroom dialogue, but it may also control inattentive behavior.

signal their authority, some examples include:&nbsp;nominating, terminating,
and interrupting speakers; marking importance or irrelevance; asking
"test" questions and evaluating students' responses; using enunciation
and grammar that formalizes the environment.</li><li><b>Students </b>also
use communication in the classroom to guide content and procedures, but
are limited in how much they can do this.&nbsp;Some examples are:&nbsp;agenda

and teachers express themselves non-verbally in all conversations, so
freely and automatically in fact, that this form of communication can
easily be overlooked.</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_138.jpg" alt=""></div></span></div></div>

<span><div><h4>ye Contact</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">One important non-verbal behavior is <b>eye contact</b>, which is the extent and timing of when a speaker looks directly at the eyes of the listener.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">For
example, in conversations between friends of equal status most native
speakers of English tend to look directly at the speaker when listening,
but to avert their gaze when speaking (Kleinke, 1986).&nbsp;<br><br>In fact,
re-engaging in eye contact often signals that a speaker is about to
finish a turn and is inviting a response from the listener.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_112.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:83%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Conversations
follow different rules if they involve someone of greater authority
talking with someone of lesser authority, such as between a teacher and a
student.<br><br>In that case, the person in authority signals greater status by gazing directly at the
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">For
students unused to continuous eye contact, it can feel like the teacher
is staring excessively, intrusively, or inappropriately; an ironic
effect can be for the student to feel more self-conscious rather than
more engaged, which was intended.<br>For similar reasons, inexperienced 
or first-time teachers can also feel uncomfortable with gazing at 
students continuously.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:11%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Nevertheless
research about the effects of eye contact suggests that it may help
anyone, whether a student or a teacher, to remember what they are seeing
and hearing (Mason, Hood, &amp; Macrae, 2004).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Communication problems result less from eye contact as such than from <b>differences in expectations </b>of
eye contact.&nbsp;If students' expectations differ very much from the
teacher's, one party may misinterpret the other party's motivations.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:77%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Among
some non-white ethnic groups, for example, eye contact follows a
pattern that reverses the conventional white, English-language pattern:
they tend to look more intently at a partner when talking, and avert
gaze when listening (Razack, 1998).
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
that case one person may interpret the direct gaze as an invitation to
start talking, when really it is an invitation to stop talking.<br>Eventually the conversational partner may find himself interrupting too much, or simply talking too long at a turn.</div></span><span style="max-width:58%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The
converse can also happen: if the first person looks away, the partner
may take the gesture as inviting the partner to keep listening, when
really the first person is inviting the partner to start talking.
Awkward gaps between comments may result.<br><br>In either case, if the conversational partners are a teacher and student, rapport may deteriorate gradually.<br>In
the first case, the teacher may even conclude, wrongly, that the
student is socially inept because the student interrupts so much.<br>In the second case, the teacher may conclude - also wrongly - that the student is very shy or even lacking in language skill.
<span><div><h4>Wait Time</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Another important non-verbal behavior is <b>wait time</b>, which is the pause between conversational turns. Wait time marks when a conversational turn begins or ends.<br>For example, if a teacher asks a question the wait time both allows and prompts students to formulate an appropriate response.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Studies
on classroom interaction generally show that the wait time in most
classes are remarkably short - less than one second (Good &amp; Brophy,
2002).<br><br>Unfortunately wait times this short can actually interfere
with most students' thinking; in one second, most students either
cannot decide what to say or can only recall a simple, automatic fact
(Tobin, 1987).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Increasing
wait times to several seconds has several desirable effects: students
give longer, more elaborate responses, they express more complex ideas,
and a wider range of students participate in discussion.
<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">with
eye contact, preferred wait times vary both among individuals and among
groups of students, and the differences in expected wait times can
sometimes lead to awkward conversations.<br>Though there are many
exceptions, girls tend to prefer longer wait times than boys - perhaps
contributing to an impression that girls are unnecessarily shy or that
boys are self-centered or impulsive.</div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NYOf3oP-5g_rC5YjuXBHf4vFvAWSS3aV5C7ZBjxyRD87OFZkeNeCRyOZu1f" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:82%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Students
from some ethnic and cultural groups tend to prefer a a much longer
wait time than is typically available in a classroom, especially when
English is the student's second language (Toth, 2004).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Therefore,

negative wait time is meant to signal lively interest in the

comments, however, may regard overlapping comments as rude
interruptions, and may also have trouble getting chances to speak.<br><br>Even
though longer wait times are often preferable, they do not always work
well with certain individuals or groups.&nbsp; For teachers, the most widely
used advice is to match wait time to the students' preferences as
closely as possible, regardless of whether these are slower or faster
than what the teacher normally prefers.<br>To the extent that a teacher
and students can match each other's pace, they will communicate more
comfortably and fully, and a larger proportion of students will
participate in discussions and activities.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:10%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_105.png" alt="">

two people interact, the physical space or distance between them -
their social distance - often indicates something about how intimate or
personal their relationship is (Noller, 2006).<br>Social distance also
affects how people describe others and their actions; someone who
habitually is more distant physically is apt to be described in more
general, abstract terms than someone who often approaches more closely
(Fujita, et al., 2006).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
white American society, a distance of approximately half a meter to a
meter is what most people prefer when talking face-to-face with a
personal friend.<br>The closer end of this range is more common if the
individuals turn sideways to each other, as when riding on an elevator;
but usually the closest distances are reserved for truly intimate
friendships, such as between spouses.</div></span></div></div>

Data Protection Officer (DPO) role is an important GDPR innovation and a
cornerstone of the GDPR’s accountability-based compliance framework. In
addition to supporting an organisation’s compliance with the GDPR, DPOs
will have an essential role in acting as intermediaries between
relevant stakeholders (e.g. supervisory authorities, data subjects, and
business units within an organisation). <br>The DPO will have
professional standing, independence, expert knowledge of data protection
and, to quote the GDPR, be ‘involved properly and in a timely manner’
in all issues relating to the protection of personal data.</div></span><span style="max-width:24%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_139.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
DPC recommends that all organisations who will be required by the GDPR
to appoint a DPO should do this as soon as possible and well in advance
of May 2018. With the authority to carry out their critical function,
the Data Protection Officer will be of pivotal importance to an
organisation’s preparations for the GDPR and meeting the accountability
obligations.</div></span></div></div>

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A

is important to note that DPOs are not personally responsible where an
organisation does not comply with the GDPR. The GDPR makes it clear that
it is the controller or the processor who is required to ensure and to
be able to demonstrate that the processing is in accordance with the
GDPR. Data protection compliance is ultimately the responsibility of the

authorities and bodies include national, regional and local
authorities, but the concept typically also includes a range of other
bodies governed by public law.<br>It is recommended, as a good practice,
that private organisations carrying out public tasks or exercising
public authority should designate a DPO.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Core
activities can be defined as the key operations necessary to achieve an
organisation’s (controller or processor’s) goals. For example, a
private security company which carries out surveillance of private
shopping centres and/or public spaces using CCTV would be required to
appoint a DPO as surveillance is a core activity of the company.&nbsp;<br>On
the other hand, it would not be mandatory to appoint a DPO where an
organisation undertakes activities such as payroll and IT support as,
while these involve the processing of personal data, they are considered
ancillary rather than core activities.

<span><div><h4>3. Data Collection and Retention Policies</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">If your organisation will be holding personal data for longer periods, you should be aware of your obligations under <b>Article 5</b>(1)(e)
as both a data controller and a data processor with regard to data
retention.&nbsp;The essence of the storage limitation principle under the
GDPR is slightly different to the existing principle under the Data
Protection Directive.&nbsp;<br><br>In summary, personal data should not be
retained in identifiable form for longer than is necessary in relation
to the purposes for which such data is processed.&nbsp;A pragmatic approach
to retention is simply to delete the data once the purpose for which it
was processed has ceased.&nbsp;Data collection and retention should be
assessed against business needs and minimised, either by not collecting
unnecessary data, by deleting data, or by rendering it anonymous.<br><br>Microenterprises should:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Define
and implement a data collection policy. The policy should detail the
categories of personal data collected and the purposes for collection.</li><li>Define
and implement a data retention policy. This policy should detail the
retention period for personal data collected and measures taken to
ensure deletion or if applicable, the techniques to render the data
non-identifiable.<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">These
policies should be communicated to all employees and periodic reviews
should be conducted to ensure that personal data is handled correctly
when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.
<span style="max-width:73%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">ith
regard to retention policies, if you intend to further process personal
data for the purposes of archiving, scientific or historical research,
or statistical purposes, you should ensure appropriate safeguards are in
place to ensure the rights and this processing does not impede freedoms
of data subjects.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">In
particular, these safeguards should ensure that technical and
organisational measures are in place to ensure respect for the principle
of data minimisation.<br>A documented retention policy should offer
guidance and provide a framework for employees to manage information
across its lifecycle so that your company complies with the laws and
regulations pertaining to data management. A retention policy should
apply to both physical and digital formats.

Microenterprises should:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Define
the responsibilities of the data controller and data processor and
ensure that processing is carried out on foot of a written agreement
detailing the appropriate technical security and organisational measures
to be applied by the data processor specifically in relation to the
personal data processing operations.</li><li>Obtain sufficient
guarantees regarding the security measures applied by processors acting
on their behalf and periodically review to ensure that the terms of the
written agreement are being adhered to.<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A practical way for a microenterprise to obtain sufficient guarantees and ensure compliance is to:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Use
a data processor that has vendor certification, appropriate IT
qualifications and/or certification, or the appropriate certification
from a relevant certifying body such as the International Organization
for Standardization or the Payment Card Industry.</li><li>Have formal
project completion / change management sign off procedures in place to
ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented and that
changes/updates are performed.</li><li>Have data processors provide
regular reports on the management of the ICT systems and following up to
ensure that work is carried out.<br></li><li>Review security measures
periodically to ensure they are up to date, this can be especially
prevalent when utilising Cloud-Based environments (see the next Topic in
the course).</li></ul></div></span>

Becoming Aware</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:91%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">It
is imperative that key personnel in your organisation are aware that
the law is changing to the GDPR, and start to factor this into their
future planning. They should start to identify areas that could cause
compliance problems under the GDPR.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:43%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_189.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:49%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Initially,
data controllers should review and enhance their organisations risk
management processes, as implementing the GDPR could have significant
implications for resources; especially for more complex organisations.
Any delay in preparations may leave your organisation susceptible to
compliance issues following the GDPR’s introduction.
<span><div><h4>2. Becoming Accountable</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Make an inventory of all personal data you hold and examine it under the following headings:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Why are you holding it?</li><li>How did you obtain it?<br></li><li>Why was it originally gathered?<br></li><li>How long will you retain it?<br></li><li>How secure is it, both in terms of encryption and accessibility?<br></li><li>Do you ever share it with third parties and on what basis might you do so?<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">This
is the first step towards compliance with the GDPR’s accountability
principle, which requires organisations to demonstrate (and, in most
cases, document) the ways in which they comply with data protection
principles when transacting business. The inventory will also enable
organisations to amend incorrect data or track third party disclosures
in the future, which is something that they may be required to do.
<span><div><h4>3. Communicating with Staff and Service Users</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Review
all current data privacy notices alerting individuals to the collection
of their data. Identify any gaps that exist between the level of data
collection and processing your organisation engages in, and how aware
you have made your customers, staff and services users of this fact. If
gaps exist, set about redressing them using the criteria laid out in ‘2:
Becoming Accountable’ above as your guide.<br>Before gathering any
personal data, current legislation requires that you notify your
customers of your identity, your reasons for gathering the data, the
use(s) it will be put to, who it will be disclosed to, and if it’s going
to be transferred outside the EU.&nbsp;<br>Under the GDPR, additional
information must be communicated to individuals in advance of
processing, such as the legal basis for processing the data, retention
periods, the right of complaint where customers are unhappy with your
implementation of any of these criteria, whether their data will be
subject to automated decision making and their individual rights under
the GDPR. The GDPR also requires that the information be provided in
concise, easy to understand and clear language.
<span style="max-width:13%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_140.png" alt=""></div></span><span><div><h4>4. Personal Privacy Rights</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">You
should review your procedures to ensure they cover all the rights
individuals have, including how you would delete personal data or
provide data electronically and in a commonly used format.<br>Rights for individuals under the GDPR include:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Subject access</li><li>To have inaccuracies corrected<br></li><li>To have information erased<br></li><li>To object to direct marketing<br></li><li>To restrict the processing of their information, including automated decision-making<br></li><li>Data portability<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">On
the whole, the rights individuals will enjoy under the GDPR are the
same as those under the Acts, but with some significant enhancements.
Organisations who already apply these principles will find the
transition to the GDPR less difficult.&nbsp; <br><u><b>Review your current procedures</b>.</u></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>How would your organisation react if it received a request from a data subject wishing to exercise their rights under the GDPR?</li><li>How long to locate (and correct or delete) the data from all locations where it is stored?<br></li><li>Who will make the decisions about deletion?<br></li><li>Can
your systems respond to the data portability provision of the GDPR, if
applicable where you have to provide the data electronically and in a
commonly used fo
<span><div><h4> How will Access Requests change?</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">You
should review and update your procedures and plan how you will handle
requests within the new timescales. (There should be no undue delay in
processing an Access Request and, at the latest, they must be concluded
within one month). The rules for dealing with subject access requests
will change under the GDPR. In most cases, you will not be able to
charge for processing an access request, unless you can demonstrate that
the cost will be excessive.&nbsp;<br>The timescale for processing an access
request will also shorten, dropping significantly from the current 40
day period. Organisations will have some grounds for refusing to grant
an access request. Where a request is deemed manifestly unfounded or
excessive, it can be refused. However, organisations will need to have
clear refusal policies and procedures in place, and demonstrate why the
request meets these criteria. You will also need to provide some
additional information to people making requests, such as your data
retention periods and the right to have inaccurate data corrected.&nbsp;<br>If
your organisation handles a large number of access requests, the impact
of the changes could be considerable. The logistical implications of
having to deal with requests in a shorter time frame and provide
additional information will need to be factored into future planning for
organisations. It could ultimately save your organisation a great deal
of administrative cost if you can develop systems that allow people to
access their information easily online.&nbsp;</div></span>

<span><div><h4>6. What is meant by the term ‘Legal Basis’</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">You
should look at the various types of data processing you carry out,
identify your legal basis for carrying it out and document it. This is
particularly important where consent is relied upon as the sole legal
basis for processing data.&nbsp;<br>Under the GDPR, individuals will have a
stronger right to have their data deleted where customer consent is the
only justification for processing. You will have to explain your legal
basis for processing personal data in your privacy notice and when you
answer a subject access request.<br>For government departments and
agencies, there has been a significant reduction in the number of legal
bases they may rely on when processing data. It will no longer be
possible to cite legitimate interests. Instead, there will be a general
necessity to have specific legislative provisions underpinning one or
more of the methods organisations use to process data.&nbsp;<br>All
organisations need to carefully consider how much personal data they
gather, and why. If any categories can be discontinued, do so. For the
data that remains, consider whether it needs to be kept in its raw
format, and how quickly you can begin the process of anonymisation and
pseudonymisation.&nbsp;
<span><div><h4> Using Customer Consent to process data</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">If
you do use customer consent when you record personal data, you should
review how you seek, obtain and record that consent, and whether you
need to make any changes. Consent must be ‘freely given, specific,
informed and unambiguous.’ Essentially, your customer cannot be forced
into consent, or be unaware that they are consenting to processing of
their personal data.&nbsp;<br>They must know exactly what they are consenting
to, and there can be no doubt that they are consenting. Obtaining
consent requires a positive indication of agreement – it cannot be
inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity.<br>If consent is
the legal basis relied upon to process personal data, you must make sure
it will meet the standards required by the GDPR. If it does not, then
you should amend your consent mechanisms or find an alternative legal
basis.</div></span><span style="max-width:13%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_101.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:79%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Note
that consent has to be verifiable, that individuals must be informed in
advance of their right to withdraw consent and that individuals
generally have stronger rights where you rely on consent to process
their data.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
GDPR is clear that controllers must be able to demonstrate that consent
was given. You should therefore review the systems you have for
recording consent to ensure you have an effective audit trail.
<span><div><h4>. Processing Children’s Data</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">If
the work of your organisation involves the processing of data from
underage subjects, you must ensure that you have adequate systems in
place to verify individual ages and gather consent from guardians.<br>The
GDPR introduces special protections for children’s data, particularly
in the context of social media and commercial internet services. The
state will define the age up to which an organisation must obtain
consent from a guardian before processing a child’s data. It should be
noted that consent needs to be verifiable, and therefore communicated to
your underage customers in language they can understand.

Reporting Data Breaches</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">You
should make sure you have the right procedures in place to detect,
report and investigate a personal data breach. Some organisations are
already required to notify the DPC when they incur a personal data
breach. However, the GDPR will bring in mandatory breach notifications,
which will be new to many organisations.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:13%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbGk3lE4KwEzd2HeSCN8PTLQeBCiNwVvkqfvtJFnfcRJFhZpCEvUfFIsAnK" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:79%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>All breaches must be reported to the DPC, typically within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted.</b>
In practice this will mean that most data breaches must be reported to
the DPC. Breaches that are likely to bring harm to an individual – such
as identity theft or breach of confidentiality – must also be reported
to the individuals concerned.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Now
is the time to assess the types of data you hold and document which
ones which fall within the notification requirement in the event of a
breach. Larger organisations will need to develop policies and
procedures for managing data breaches, both at central or local level.
It is worth noting that a failure to report a breach when required to do
so could result in a fine, as well as a fine for the breach itself.
<span><div><h4>0. DPIA - Data Protection by Design and Default</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A
Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is the process of
systematically considering the potential impact that a project or
initiative might have on the privacy of individuals. It will allow
organisations to identify potential privacy issues before they arise,
and come up with a way to mitigate them.&nbsp;<br>A DPIA can involve
discussions with relevant parties/stakeholders. Ultimately such an
assessment may prove invaluable in determining the viability of future
projects and initiatives. The GDPR introduces mandatory DPIAs for those
oganisations involved in high-risk processing; for example where a new
technology is being deployed, where a profiling operation is likely to
significantly affect individuals, or where there is large scale
monitoring of a publicly accessible area.&nbsp;<br>Where the DPIA indicates
that the risks identified in relation to the processing of personal data
cannot be fully mitigated, data controllers will be required to consult
the DPC before engaging in the process.

should now start to assess whether future projects will require a DPIA
and, if the project calls for a DPIA, consider:</div></span><span style="max-width:19%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:73%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Who will do it?</li><li>Who else needs to be involved?<br></li><li>Will the process be run centrally or locally?<br></li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">It
has always been good practice to adopt privacy by design as a default
approach; privacy by design and the minimisation of data have always
been implicit requirements of the data protection principles.&nbsp;<br>However,
the GDPR enshrines both the principle of ‘privacy by design’ and the
principle of ‘privacy by default’ in law. This means that service
settings must be automatically privacy friendly, and requires that the
development of services and products takes account of privacy
considerations from the outset.
<span><div><h4>ata Protection Officers</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
GDPR will require some organisations to designate a Data Protection
Officer (DPO). Organisations requiring DPOs include public authorities,
organisations whose activities involve the regular and systematic
monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or organisations who

at school, supplemented by ample amounts of non-verbal communication -
gestures, facial expressions, and other “body language”.&nbsp;<br>Often the
talk involves many people at once, or even an entire class, and
individuals have to take turns speaking while also listening to others
having their turns, or sometimes ignoring the others if a conversation
does not concern them.</div></span><span style="max-width:94%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_062.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">As
the teacher, therefore, you find yourself playing an assortment of
roles when communicating in classrooms: Master of Ceremonies, referee -
and of course a source of new knowledge.<br>Your challenge is to sort 
the roles out so that you are playing the right ones in the right 
combinations at the right times.&nbsp;<br>Often,
you will indeed be more sincere and brief, and you will find that
minimizing power differences between you and students is a good idea.</div></span></div></div>

events are often so complex that just talking with students can become
confusing. It helps to think of the challenge as a problem in
communication - or as one expert put it, of "who says what to whom, and
with what effect" (Lasswell, 1964).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">In
classrooms, things often do not happen at an even pace or in a logical
order, or with just the teacher and one student interacting while others
listen or wait patiently.&nbsp;<br>While such moments do occur, events may
sometimes instead be more like a kaleidoscope of overlapping
interactions, disruptions, and decisions - even when activities are
generally going well. An example of this may be seen on the next slide.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">One
student finishes a task while another is still only halfway done. A
third student looks like she is reading, but she may really be
dreaming.&nbsp;<br>You begin to bring her back on task by speaking to her,
only to be interrupted by a fourth student with a question about an
assignment. While you answer the fourth student, a fifth walks in with a
message from the office requiring a response; so the bored (third)
student is overlooked for a while longer.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_151.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Meanwhile,
the first student - the one who finished the current task - now begins
telling a joke to a sixth student, just to pass the time. You wonder,&nbsp;<i>“Should I speak now to the bored, quiet reader or to the joke-telling student? Or should I move on with the lesson?”&nbsp;</i><br><br>While you are wondering this, a seventh student raises his hand with a question, and so </div></span>

<span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">ay
to manage situations like these is to understand and become comfortable
with the key features of communication that are characteristic of
classrooms.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:95%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left"><ul><li>One set of features has to do with the functions or<b> purposes of communication</b>, especially the balance among talk related to content, to procedures, and to controlling behavior.</li><li>Another feature has to do with the nature of <b>non-verbal communication</b> - how it supplements and sometimes even contradicts what is said verbally<br></li><li>A
third feature has to do with the unwritten expectations held by

is the act of placing, fastening, or laying down heavy objects while
employing mechanical shifting tools. It also includes installing and

employ technology such as chain blocks, winch systems, and cranes and
hoists to move loads.When transporting a load, rigging may be a
complicated process that involves many different considerations.<br>Before
lifting a weight, they must be fully aware of the most secure handling
and placement techniques.Common rigging tools include shackles,
turnbuckles, lifting eye bolts, yoke and clevis ends, nuts, etc.

lifting operation involves raising and lowering cargo. The thing(s)
being lifted, which may or may not be a person(s), are referred to as a
load.&nbsp;<br>A lifting operation can be carried out manually or with the
use of lifting gear. The phrase "manual handling of loads" is frequently
used to describe manual lifting, holding, putting down, carrying, or
transporting. Lifting is only used for locating a heavy object from one
place to another.<br>It mostly includes vertical movements only.Common
lifting tools include forklifts, jacks, cranes, and building cradles, as

lifting beam is a below-the-hook lifting tool used to add pick points
to weights when one pick point is insufficient for load stability. To
distribute the lift forces across the beam, they often include two or
more widely spaced pick points on the bottom and a single attachment
point at the top.<br><br><b>Spreader Beam: </b>The beam is referred to
be a spreader beam if the load mostly places compressive stress on it.

slings and shackles that secure the hook to the load are all crucial
pieces of equipment utilised in the lift. You can quickly determine a
load's weight in a number of methods. <br><b><br></b><br>Professionals
have to figure it out on their own if no load weight information has
been given. They should apply the following formula to calculate the
load's units and the materials that makeup it:<br><b>Weight of the load = Weight per unit x Total unit</b><br>Let’s try with numbers,<br>If the material has a volume of 200 cubic feet and weighs 200 pounds per cubic foot, the weight would be as follows:<br>200 * 200 = 40,000 lbs.<br>So, the total weight is 40,000 lbs.

are crucial techniques in rigging and lifting. Different methods
require different hitches. There are four types of hitching techniques
that are vertical hitch, double line hitch, basket hitch and choker
hitch. A rigger or lifter should choose the compatible hitch technique
to lift and rig the heavy object. <br><br><b>Vertical Hitch : </b>The
most fundamental hitch for directly attaching a weight to lifting
equipment is a vertical hitch, often known as a straight hitch.&nbsp;<br>One
eye of a single chain sling, wire rope sling, or synthetic sling is
connected to the crane or hoist hook on a vertical hitch, and the second
eye is attached to the point of attachment on the load.</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>The entire lifting capacity of the sling will be used in a lift made with a vertical hitch.&nbsp;<br><br>When

A choker hitch is an effective way to secure a sling and increase load
management to cinch it down. One eye of the choker hitch is looped
around the weight, passed through it, and then fastened to the crane or
hoist hook when employing it.&nbsp;<br><br>A choker hitch's lifting capacity
is reduced to 75–80% of what it can be in a single-leg vertical hitch
because of tensions induced at the choke point.&nbsp;When the angle of the
choke is 120° or more, the capacity reduction is minimal.&nbsp;A lifting
capability as low as 40% of the single leg may occur from a choke angle
of fewer than 120 degrees.</div></span><span style="max-width:96%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Choker Hitch Capacity: </b></div></span><span style="max-width:34%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_079.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_145.png" alt=""></div></span></div></div>

rigger should be aware of their safe working load (SWL) restrictions in
relation to the rope or chain being used, as well as the appropriate
fittings and end attachments to employ for a given lifting, hoisting, or
rigging operation.<br>To ensure the maximum level of safety, only
forged alloy steel and load-rated kinds should be used for overhead
lifting and hoisting, even if there are many other connections,
fittings, and end attachments available. Such attachments have their SWL
imprinted right there.<br><b>Connection:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; A wire rope's end tends
to fray easily and is difficult to connect to machinery and other
objects. Wire ropes' ends can be secured using a variety of methods to
increase their utility.<br><b>Spliced Eyes Method:</b> The most frequent
and practical kind of wire rope end fitting is when the end is turned
back to form a loop. The loose end is then secured by splicing it back
onto the wire rope using a variety of techniques.</div></span><span style="max-width:64%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">However,
wire rope splicing is a skill that needs instruction and the right
equipment to be performed safely and successfully; as a result, only
skilled splicers should do eye splicing.&nbsp;<br>For information on the

chuck-like hollow clamping devices create a collar around the wire rope
to be held and apply a powerful clamping force when the rope is
tightened, locking the rope's strands and wires. The connections
resemble the fold-back eye, but the sleeve is made of a split collet,
sleeve, and nut arrangement rather than being swaged on.<br>Place the
nut on the wire rope, create a loop with the necessary eye size, and
attach the collets to the wire rope to create a collet connection. Place
the dead end of the rope at least half its diameter away from the
collets.<br>To turn on the nut as far as possible, hold the collets
together (by hand). By grasping
<span><div><h4>Sockets</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">When
a termination fitting needs to be replaced regularly, a socket is
helpful. For instance, if the end of a wire rope is in an area with
heavy wear, the rope may need to be periodically trimmed, necessitating
the removal and reapplication of the termination hardware.</div></span><span style="max-width:79%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A
dragline's ends of the drag ropes serve as an illustration of this. The
wire rope's end loop, which is coiled around an additional part known
as the wedge, is inserted into a socket's tapered opening. <br><br>As
the load is progressively eased onto the rope, the arrangement is
knocked into place. The wedge gets more secure and tightens its hold on
the rope as the strain on the wire rope rises.</div></span><span style="max-width:16%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_075.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
zinc-poured socket is the strongest wire rope end connection and, when
properly fastened, will generate all of the wire rope's strength. Never,

is a chance that the wire rope will bend excessively tightly when it is
terminated with a loop, especially if the loop is attached to a device
that disperses the load over a small area. <br><br>To maintain the
loop's natural shape and shield the cable from pinching and abrasion on
the inside of the loop, a thimble can be added. The industry standard is
to employ thimbles in loops. The thimble keeps the load's direct line
of sight from the wires.
<span><div><h4>Clips (Clamps)</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:67%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Using cable or clips is the most typical way to create an eye or attach a wire rope to a piece of equipment. <br><br>Clipped
eye terminations, when made correctly and in accordance with the
manufacturer's Clip Installation Tables, will develop around 80% of the
wire rope strength.
<span><div><h4>Things to Consider While Using Clips</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>When
employing clips, make sure the corrugation in the saddles matches the
rope lay being used—left-lay clips for left-lay wire ropes, and
right-lay clips for right-lay wire ropes, respectively. Otherwise, the
ridges between the forging's corrugations will run perpendicular to and
between the wire rope's strands rather than straight. When the clip nuts
are appropriately tightened, this will cause the wire stands to cut.</li><li>Allow no slack in the wire rope between the clamps in either direction.</li><li>Never
join two straight lengths of rope directly with any form of clip. If
such a connection is required, construct an eye with thimbles in each
length using clips, then join the eyes.</li><li>Never use clips to join two straight lengths of rope.</li><li>To prevent the rope from wearing in the eye and to create a more secure connection, always construct an eye using a thimble.</li><li>Never reuse clips for connections; doing so will prevent them from developing the proper efficiency.

derricks and forklifts are some tools that have been around for a very
long time. In accordance with their design capability, these instruments
can move huge loads weighing up to several hundred tons both vertically
and horizontally, load and unload big objects, and erect lofty
structures.<br>In this topic, we will get to know different lifting and hoisting instruments and understand their best practices.<br><br><b>Derricks: </b>A
derrick is a tool made of one mast, or a comparable element, that is
hinged flexibly at the bottom and supported at the head by guys or
braces, either with or without a boom.<br>It is controlled by (often
four) lines that are powered by manual labour or motors so that the pole
is capable of moving in all four directions. Like a crane, a line with a
hook at one end runs up the mast and over its top.

two-drum winch typically drives the hoisting and topping actions of a
derrick. The topping action is not necessary when the boom is simply
used for lifting and swinging; instead, a fixed rope guy line is
employed.&nbsp;<br>Although the derrick's winch can be placed at any height, it is frequently found at the floor level of the boom foot.
<span><div><h4>Chicago Boom</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
Chicago boom, which is mostly used during new high-rise construction
projects, enables the economical and effective movement of objects that
might be too big or heavy to be lifted using traditional hoist cages. <br><br>With
the boom stepped in a fixed socket secured to the upright and
structural beam connections or bracing, acting as the rigid legs, the
device is typically attached to an exterior upright element of a
structure that serves as the mast.</div></span><span style="max-width:52%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
load, boom, and boom point swing line fall are all fully assembled on
the derrick. With lifting capacity ranging from a quarter ton to around
35 tons, Chicago boom lengths range from 10 to 125 feet.<br>The majority are made of steel tubing, trussed or latticed angle iron, or a combination of both.</div></span><span style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_059.png" alt=""></div></span>

<span><div><h4>General Safety Guidelines for Scaffolding</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
following rules, which are intended to enhance safety in the building,
dismantling, and usage of scaffolds, must be read and followed by all
scaffold users. These recommendations do not claim to be exhaustive, nor
do they intend to supersede or replace other extra safety and
precautionary measures to address common or uncommon circumstances.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>&nbsp;A
competent individual must do a survey of the job site to look for risks
such as ditches, debris, high tension wires, unsecured apertures, and
other dangers left behind by other trades.</li><li>Never use any tools that are broken or otherwise flawed. Label it or tag it as broken. Take it off the job site.</li><li>Scaffolds must be erected in line with the manufacturer's instructions or the design.</li><li>Never erect, disassemble, or modify a scaffold without the guidance of a qualified individual.</li><li>Avoid misusing or abusing the scaffolding's equipment.</li><li>Users
should regularly check erected scaffolds to ensure that they are kept
in a safe state. Any risky situation should be reported to your manager.</li><li>Do not take a chance! Seek help from the scaffold supplier if you are unsure about the scaffold's use or safety.
<span><div><h4>Disassembling Scaffolding</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">To disassemble scaffolding, operators must follow the safety instructions below:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Before
starting the deconstruction process, make sure that the scaffolding
hasn't been structurally altered in a way that would render it unsafe,
and if it has, reconstruct where necessary. All scaffold ties are
included in this.</li><li>Before removing a component, think about the impact it will have on the rest of the scaffold.</li><li>Keep extra parts and equipment off the level that is being disassembled.</li><li>Removing ties shouldn't be done before taking down the scaffold above.</li><li>Don't just throw the disassembled parts off the scaffold; lower them carefully.</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:7%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbBT_8ZXcobPRj9gPZuVxCUzb-FKOTHp61mf4MQj4ihw8w8fGRxuSnSm2ca" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:85%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">However,
because equipment and scaffolding systems are different, it is
important to always refer to the guidelines provided by the equipment's
supplier or manufacturer
<span><div><h4>Maintenance of Scaffold</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
majority of system scaffold manufacturers offer contractors daily and
monthly inspection checklists, which they advise them to follow. <br><br>To
maintain a well-maintained scaffold, a capable employee who is trained
and knows what to look for should pay attention to the following topics
of concern:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Every
time the scaffold is put up, check it out. Cross-bracing and the
scaffold's accuracy are simple things to examine while it is mounted on
the wall because issues are extremely obvious that way.</li><li>Consider
the components used to create the majority of the changeable
scaffolding. The preferred material is heavy-duty structural steel,
which produces sturdy scaffold structures that, when employing the right
tools, are typically not too difficult to store and carry.</li><li>It
is impossible to prevent finish wear on the scaffold. Sandblasting and
repainting may be required depending on the climate and how frequently a
particular elevating scaffold system is used.</li><li>The scaffold must
be taken out of operation if the steel has any kind of damage that
affects its strength or ability to maintain it straight and level.</li></ul></div></span>
</div></span>
</li></ul></div></span>
</li><li><br>Bronze bushed lubricates itself.</li><li><br>The load should not be lifted if the ferrule is loose.</li></ul></div></span></div></div>

and ladders are practically always used in construction work to let
personnel access and work in areas that would otherwise be unreachable.
However, unless access to such work is problematic by ladder or any
other means, scaffolds are rarely cost-effective for work at heights of
less than 30 ft.<br> In order to support people and materials during the
construction or restoration of buildings and other large structures,
scaffolding is a temporary framework that provides a secure area to work
in and safe access that is appropriate for the activity being done.<br>Although
built-up wooden structures and wood planking have historically been
used as scaffolding materials, the majority of scaffolding today is made
up mostly of seamless steel or extruded aluminium tube welded panels,
as well as steel or aluminium tubing and couplers.</div></span></div></div>

rungs on these ladders must be parallel, level, and evenly spaced, just
like the steps on stepladders. Bored wooden ladder rungs that extend at
least flush with the outside rail surface should be installed through
the side rails. To keep the rung from twisting and to keep it in place
on the side rail, the shoulder of each rung should be pressed firmly on
the rails. The tenon should then be fastened in place with a nail or an
equivalent. To achieve the required strength, rungs on metal and plastic
ladders should be tightly attached to side rails.

as a phenomenon is defined by chemical reactions involving exothermic
oxidation processes that release heat, light, and various reaction
products such as smoke or gases. To fully grasp fire safety practices
one must understand all elements essential to fire. An upgrade version
of the traditional Fire Triangle serves this purpose and represents
these core elements: fuel, heat, oxygen, and chemical chain reactions.</div></span><span style="max-width:20%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_123.jpg" alt="Image 1: Fire"><div> Image 1: Fire </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>The fire tetrahedron</b><br><b>●&nbsp; Fuel:</b>
This is any substance that can combust when in the right conditions and
exposed to sufficient heat. Examples include wood, paper, fabrics,
gases, and certain metals.<br><b>●&nbsp; Heat:</b> Energy created through
combustion can come from various sources - an open flame, electrical
sparks, or chemical reactions are just a few sources that provide
sources of ignition.<br><b>●&nbsp; Oxygen:</b> A component of the air we
breathe, oxygen supports combustion. Without sufficient oxygen, a fire
cannot start or continue to burn.<br><b>●&nbsp; Chemical chain reaction:</b>
This is a series of events where the products of combustion react with
oxygen to produce heat, which further sustains the reaction.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>When all these elements come together in just the right proportions, a fire can ignite and thrive.&nbsp;</div></span></div></div>

<span><div><h4>Fire Science and Behaviour</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>Removing
one element at any point will extinguish it; this principle serves as
the cornerstone for many different fire-fighting methods.<b><br></b><br><b>Fire behaviour</b><br>Understanding fire behaviour is essential in fire prevention and control. There are several key aspects of fire behaviour:<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ignition: </b>This is the initial stage where heat, oxygen, and fuel come together to start a fire.<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Growth:</b>
If conditions are favourable, the fire will grow. This growth may
depend upon factors like fuel type and quantity, oxygen availability,
and source intensity of heat.<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fully developed:</b> At this stage, the fire has consumed all available fuel and oxygen in the immediate area. It produces maximum heat.<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Decay:</b> The fire decreases in intensity as fuel is consumed or as the oxygen supply is restricted.<br><br>Understanding these stages can help us take preventative measures and respond effectively if a fire does start.</div></span>
<span><div><h4>Fire Science and Behaviour</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Conduction:</b> Fire spreads by heating the material, which transfers heat from molecule to molecule.<br><b>Convection:</b> Fire spreads through the movement of hot gases or smoke to cooler areas, igniting combustible materials in those areas.<br><b>Radiation:</b> Fire emits energy that heats up &amp; ignites combustible materials without needing physical contact.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>Understanding
fire science and behaviour is essential for effective fire prevention
and safety measures. This knowledge will guide you in developing a
deeper understanding of the subsequent topics in fire safety, such as
fire safety regulations, roles and responsibilities, and risk

design and construction have an enormous effect on fire safety in any
given structure. Fireproof materials used strategically can slow the
spread of flames and smoke, giving occupants more time to escape while
providing firefighters with better conditions to extinguish fires more
effectively. Here we discuss aspects of construction that contribute to
fire resistance in buildings.</div></span><span style="max-width:62%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Understanding fire resistance in building construction</b><br>Fire
resistance in building construction refers to the ability of building
components to resist fire and smoke in an orderly fashion within an
allotted period of time. Usually measured as how well passive fire
protection systems withstand standard tests for their fireproofness.<br><br><b>Fire-resistant materials</b></div></span><span style="max-width:26%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_142.jpg" alt="Image 13: Concrete blocks"><div> Image 13: Concrete blocks </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>Fire-resistant

These should be designed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke and
may include fire and smoke dampers and smoke control systems.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br><b>Fire resistance ratings</b><br>Fire
resistance ratings indicate the duration for which a construction
element can withstand a standard fire test. These ratings are used to
classify the fire resistance of various elements, such as walls, floors,

<span><div><h4>Fire Risk Assessment Process</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>Fire
Risk Analysis is an integral component of maintaining a safe
environment, whether residential, commercial, or industrial settings.
This systematic process seeks to identify potential fire hazards, assess
their risks of harming individuals or property, and implement suitable
controls in order to eliminate or mitigate such threats. Implementation
and comprehension of thorough Fire Risk Assessment processes are
paramount components in assuring fire safety.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br><b>Step 1: Identify hazards</b><br>The
first step in the fire risk assessment process is to identify potential
fire hazards. This involves recognizing all possible sources of
ignition, types of fuel, and oxygen sources.<br><br>Sources of ignition
could be anything that can generate heat or a spark capable of starting a
fire. These can range from electrical equipment, heaters, and smoking
materials to more specialized items such as welding equipment or certain
chemical reactions.<br>Fuel sources include anything that can burn.
Typical examples in a workplace might include furniture, paper,
chemicals, waste materials, or flammable gases and liquids.</div></span>
<span><div><h4>Fire Risk Assessment Process</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:70%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br><b>Step 2: Identify people at risk</b><br>Next,
identify who might be at risk in case of a fire. This should include
all those present, but special consideration should be paid to the
elderly, disabled individuals and children, as well as employees working
alone with hazardous materials or substances.<br><br> <br><b>Step 3: Evaluate, remove, reduce, and protect from risk</b><br>In
this step, the risk associated with each hazard identified is
evaluated, and measures are decided upon to remove, reduce, or protect
from these risks.</div></span><span style="max-width:22%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_134.jpg" alt="Image 44:An elderly woman"><div> Image 44:An elderly woman </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>This
might involve measures to prevent ignition sources and fuel from coming
into contact with one another, ensuring appropriate storage and
handling of flammable materials, maintaining equipment to prevent
overheating or sparks, or implementing no-smoking policies.&nbsp;Protection
measures include ensuring appropriate fire detection and warning
<span><div><h4>Fire Risk Assessment Process</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br><b>Step 5: Review</b><br>Finally,
maintain an up-to-date assessment by regularly reviewing it to make
sure it remains valid, for instance, when changes to premises or
personnel occur or there are indicators suggesting its validity is no
longer current.<br><br>In conclusion, fire risk assessment is an
integral element of safety. By identifying potential hazards early and
mitigating them accordingly, this systematic process ensures everyone in
a building or space stays safe from fire hazards and creates an overall
safer environment. By adhering to it regularly and properly, you can
significantly decrease fire incidents while creating a more secure
environment for all.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Identifying and Evaluating Fire Hazards</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br>Identification
and evaluation of fire hazards is a fundamental element of fire risk
analysis. Through this stage, potential risks are discovered, assessed

a fossilised material that has accumulated under the earth's surface

terms used to describe raw petroleum. It is a combination of numerous
organic compounds and is the source of hydrocarbons such as methane,
ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and a variety of other paraffinic,
naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons, which are the foundation of
today's organic industry.<br>Refining crude oil yields a variety of
petroleum products such as gaseous and liquid fuels, lubricating oil,
solvents, asphalts, waxes, and coke.Thermal and catalytic treatments of
these hydrocarbons result in the synthesis of several lighter
hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. The hydrocarbon processing
sector is separated into three main activities:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ol><li>Petroleum Production.</li><li>Refining.</li><li>Petrochemical Manufacturing.

endurance of the equipment and the flexibility of the well to manage
changing reservoir conditions are two features of well design that
contribute to a longer life span. Reduced pressures caused by fluid
production, lower production rates caused by lower pressures, and
changing Gas-0il Ratios (GOR) and Watercuts (fw) over the reservoir's
life are all examples of changing reservoir conditions.<br>Flexibility
in well design comprises the ability of the initial design to
accommodate all predicted reservoir changes or, if this is not possible,
designing the original completion to be able to be adjusted to handle
these changes at the lowest possible cost.<br>Finally, the well must be
capable of achieving its objectives. Other than oil or gas production,
the well can be built to achieve a variety of goals. These are some
examples:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Sand
control for reservoirs composed of unconsolidated reservoir rock or
rock prone to Fines Movement (the movement of fine-grained elements
within the rock).</li><li>Zonal isolation for reservoirs with numerous zones (to allow each zone to be shut down individually if necessary).</li><li>Well
stimulation in reservoirs with limited permeability or those that are
prone to well damage; and artificial lift for low-rate wells.</li></ul></div></span></div></div>

crude oil or natural gas reservoir, it is recognised as the reservoir's
Discovery Well. This marks the commencement of the field development's
Appraisal and Delineation Stage. Wells are drilled during the Appraisal
and Delineation Stage of field development to give data for Development
Geologists to evaluate the newly discovered reservoir.<br><br>Appraisal
Wells are wells drilled in the reservoir's interior that are used to
collect information from Core Analysis, Well Logging, and Well Test.
These can be used to analyse important reservoir properties and create
trend maps of these properties, such as depth, thickness, porosity,
water saturation, permeability, and so on. Delineation Wells are wells

Development Stage</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">This
stage begins once the development geologists and reservoir engineers
believe the&nbsp;reservoir has been appropriately evaluated and identified.
All of the wells required for&nbsp;the preliminary Field Development Plan are
drilled, finished, and connected to the&nbsp;production facilities during
the development stage.<br><br>Multiple drilling rigs may be
operating&nbsp;concurrently during this time in order to drill and complete
all production wells, injection&nbsp;wells, and possibly observation wells
necessary by the development plan on time.<br>After the field has been
put into production, the wells produce into fixed-capacity&nbsp;production
facilities. If the production potential of all development wells exceeds
the&nbsp;surface facilities' production capacity, then production will be
limited by the capacity of&nbsp;the production facilities. (In other words,
the facilities operate as a bottleneck in the&nbsp;system, and the wells must
be produced at a lower capacity than their potential.)<br>As reservoir
pressure is low, the wells' prospective production capacity decreases
(due to&nbsp;reduced drawdown), and they can no longer produce oil at full
capacity. (In other words,&nbsp;the reservoir pressure eventually drops to
the point where the wells become the system's&nbsp;bottleneck.)

the facility capacity is relatively stable over time, the early era of
production,&nbsp;when the facility capacity is the bottleneck, is sometimes
referred to as the Plateau&nbsp;Stage of production (barring any upgrades or
additions to the facilities). There is a lot of&nbsp;action going on behind
the scenes to maintain the facilities running at full capacity.
The&nbsp;reservoir pressure will begin to fall when production begins due to
fluid withdrawals.<br>Furthermore, as time passes, undesirable water or gas production may grow,&nbsp;necessitating Well Interventions (Workovers).</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Infill wells may need to be drilled.</li><li>Completion designs may need to be adjusted.</li><li>Wells may need to be stimulated.</li><li>Water or gas shut-off workovers may be required.</li><li>Artificial lift may be required.</li><li>Secondary production techniques may be employed; and so on.</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">As a result, many reservoir management actions may be required during this plateau period to keep the facilities fully</div></span>

cable tool is repeatedly&nbsp;elevated and allowed to drop (free fall) down

the most frequent rig used in the previous century (1900s), and it is
likely&nbsp;that you are most familiar with it from old movies and
documentaries. The following&nbsp;schematic diagram depicts a standard rotary
drilling rig.<br><br>The Derrick or Mast (Item 14) is the tall steel
structure with its base on the rig floor, as&nbsp;seen in the diagram. This
illustration also shows the Kelly (Item 19), the Kelly Bushing&nbsp;(not
shown), and the Turn Table or Rotary Table (Item 20) on the rig floor.
On a&nbsp;traditional rotary rig, these are the components of the Rotary
System that deliver torque&nbsp;to the drill string.<br><br>The kelly is a
hollow square or hexagonal section of pipe that allows the drill pipe to
pass&nbsp;through. The kelly bushing is raised above the rig floor and is
paired to a similarly shaped&nbsp;bushing (square or hexagonal). Consider the
kelly to be a hollow square or hexagonal&nbsp;bolt, and the kelly bushing to
be a matched square or hexagonal wrench used to turn the&nbsp;bolt.<br><br>The
kelly bushing is held in place by four huge metal pins in the master
bushing,&nbsp;which is then held in place by the rotary table. The torque
necessary to rotate the master&nbsp;bushing, kelly bushing, kelly drill pipe,
and drill bit is provided by the rotary table.</div></span></div></div>

concentration of greenhouse gases can be measured in one approach by
measuring the concentration of a specific greenhouse gas. In 1958,
Charles David Keeling began measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii's Big
Island.&nbsp;Since beginning his measurements, Keeling has noticed a steady
increase in carbon dioxide content. His curve, now known as the Keeling
curve, is depicted in the figure below. It has an annual cycle in carbon
dioxide concentrations that is overlaid by an increasing average.<br>The
initial carbon dioxide concentration was little more than 310 parts per
million. It is now at 400 parts per million. These measurements show
that carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing
since the middle of the twentieth century.</div></div></span></div></span></span>

body shop technicians.<br>The task of MET technicians is to locate any
mechanical or electrical components that are damaged on a damaged car or
light commercial vehicle, remove them, and then replace them both
before and after body repair work is done.

<span><div><h4>Beginning the Career</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
majority of technicians begin their careers with an apprenticeship or
training course. In today's budget cuts and high tuition costs, going to
university and continuing education may not be the best option for
everyone, and many employers may not require a degree where experience
and work-based skills are more valuable.&nbsp;<br>An apprenticeship will
provide individuals with the work knowledge and qualifications they need
to earn while they learn without accumulating debt. Applying for an
apprenticeship requires GCSEs in math, English, and science.</div></span><span style="max-width:49%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Pre-
apprenticeship training is offered by the Institute of the Motor 
Industry (IMI) to pupils between the ages of 14 and 16.&nbsp;<br>With
recognised Level 1 Technical Certificates within the Apprenticeships
and Advanced Apprenticeships frameworks, the training offers a quick
path to progressing into a full Apprenticeship.</div></span>

older automobiles and trucks, consistent and accurate body panel
alignment can become problematic with time. Fortunately, fixing the
issue is not difficult when the proper approach is used.</div></span><span style="max-width:43%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_173.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Fender</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
door-to-fender gap, which can also be impacted by the fender-to-hood
gap, makes it difficult to align the fender. A technician should always
use the factory-supplied adjustments; further adjusting the specified
slots is never recommended.<br>A bent fender mounting flange may be
present when there is a large fender-to-hood gap. The fender mounting
flange must be reformed by pulling the fender toward the vehicle's
centre line.
<span><div><h4>Installation of a Car Door</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The installation of a door can be difficult. You must adjust the latch if it is out of alignment when closed and latching.</div></span><span style="max-width:58%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Sometimes
the door's latch mechanism is the element that can be adjusted; other
times, the latch pin on the door pillar that the latch engages needs to
be adjusted. It only requires a small amount of attachment hardware
lubrication, a light tap of the latch or pin to approximate the correct
position, tightening, and trying again. With this technique, you can
move the back edge of the door in, out, and up and down.<br>Older cars
sometimes have hard-to-move hardware. Hardware that is held together by
Torx or hex head bolts typically breaks down in the presence of
penetrating oil or some light hammer tapping.

increase the amount of contact between the tyres and the road, give good
handling and steering stability, and assure the comfort of the
passengers. In this module, you will learn about the fundamentals of the
vehicle suspension system.<br>The suspension system connects the vehicle body to the wheels. Its purpose is to:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Locate the wheels while enabling them to steer and move up and down.</li><li>Minimise road noise and keep the wheels in contact with the pavement.</li><li>Distribute the vehicle's weight among the wheels.</li><li>Reduce
the weight of the vehicle as much as possible, especially the unsprung

accelerating.</li><li>Function in tandem with the tyres and seat springs to provide optimum ride comfort.
<span><div><h4>Understanding Vehicle Suspension System</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A
vehicle's suspension system is necessary to absorb and dampen road
shocks. This makes the passengers more comfortable and guards against
load and vehicle component damage. A spring positioned between the wheel
and the car's body allows the wheel to follow the surface of the road.
The tyre is crucial in absorbing small road shocks. It is frequently
referred to as the primary suspension mechanism. Between the body and
the wheel axles are springs that support the vehicle body. These
components, along with the damper, are referred to as the suspension
system.</div></span><span style="max-width:37%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_036.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:58%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
springs in the suspension system absorb road movement or shock. The
spring stores the energy of the action. The actual spring can take on a
variety of shapes, from a steel coil to a nitrogen-pressurised chamber.
Soft springs are the most comfortable, although stiff springs can be
ideal for good performance.&nbsp;<br>Therefore, vehicle springs and suspension are designed to strike a balance between comfort and effective handlin

many other developments, active suspension or electronic management of
suspension originated in the Formula 1 racing world. It is currently
gradually gaining popularity in production cars. Traditional suspension
systems are usually a trade-off between soft springs for comfort and
harder springs for better cornering. Active systems can switch between
the two extremes.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Conventional Suspension System</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">A
typical or conventional suspension system, which consists of springs
and dampers, is passive. In other words, its features remain the same
when it is put in the vehicle. The main advantage of a traditional
suspension system is its predictability.&nbsp;<br>Over time, the driver will
become acquainted with the suspension of a vehicle and will learn its
capabilities and limitations. The downside is that the system has no way
of correcting conditions that are not within the scope of its original
design.
<span><div><h4>Advantages of Active Suspension System</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Active suspension offers these main advantages:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Improvements to ride comfort, handling, and safety.</li><li>Predictable vehicle control in various situations.</li><li>Handling is the same whether the vehicle is laden or empty.</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
advantages are substantial, and as component prices fall, the system
will be offered on a wider range of cars. In the near future, it's
anticipated that more off-road vehicles will likely be equipped with
active suspension.<br>Continuous self-adjustment is a feature of an
active suspension system. It keeps an eye on the road conditions and
modifies its characteristics accordingly. Sensors provide data to an
electronic control unit (ECU), which then outputs to actuators, as is
the case with all electronic control systems. Active suspension delivers
better handling, comfort, responsiveness, and safety by adapting its
properties in reaction to shifting road conditio

contemporary automobiles have front suspension systems with an upper
wishbone- shaped arm attached to the inner wing or an outrigger and a
lower wishbone arm attached to the chassis. The dampers are typically
installed between the inner wing or outrigger and the lower wishbone
arm.&nbsp;<br>Some manufacturers put the bottom damper on the upper wishbone.
The damper is often positioned within the coil spring when the wishbone
suspension uses one. However, removing the damper without removing the
coil spring is possible.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">The Coil Spring and Damper</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
coil spring and damper may be combined on some vehicles, in which case
the spring must be separated and attached to the new damper. Sometimes
the coil spring needs to be compressed before the damper is removed from
the car, especially where it contacts the upper wishbone.&nbsp;<br>Before
you remove the damper from the car, the lower wishbone on either a
coil-spring or torsion-bar suspension must be jacked up to relieve
pressure on the damper bolts.</div></span><span style="max-width:46%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_196.png" alt="">

coil springs for the front suspension must have the appropriate rating
if a coil spring needs to be changed. Additionally, it is preferable
to replace both of the front springs because it's possible that one of
them does not exactly match the new spring's grade.&nbsp;<br>Check with your local dealer about the rating. Painted marks typically identify springs in different colours

<span><div><h4>What is Sous Vide?</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Sous vide (pronunciation: sue-veed) is a popular cooking technique that originated in France. Sous vide means <b>under the vacuum</b>&nbsp;and
implies the vacuum-sealing of food in a bag. After the food has been
sealed, it is cooked at a precise temperature in a water bath. Sous Vide
cooking technique is helpful in cooking food to the desired level of
doneness.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Why Should Cooking be Done via Sous Vide Method?</div></span><span style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_224.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:61%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Traditional
cooking methods do not provide chefs with enough temperature control.
This often leads to food being overcooked from the outside while
remaining almost raw (or undercooked) from the inside. Foods cooked with
these methods can become dry and chewy, tasteless, and undesirable for
the eaters.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">In
contrast to these traditional cooking methods,&nbsp;Sous&nbsp;Vide provides chefs
and cooks with the required control over their cooking. It comprises
precise temperature control and circulation to the cook, leading to
numerous benefits.</div></span>

with Sous Vide means cooking foods at a fixed temperature for a fixed
amount of time. This leads to very precise and consistent results. For
example, if a customer wants a medium-done steak, then the sous vide
cooking method will provide them with exactly what they want. In
contrast, it is possible with traditional cooking that some parts of
their steak end up being raw, others being well done, while the rest of
the steak gets medium rare.&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></span><span><span role="button" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648gmail-mat-expansion-panel-header-2" aria-controls="cdk-accordion-child-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-disabled="false"><span><span><b>It Enhances Taste of the Food</b></span></span></span><div role="region" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648gmail-cdk-accordion-child-2" aria-labelledby="mat-expansion-panel-header-2" style="height:0px"><div><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_226.png"><div></div></div></div></div></span><span><span role="button" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648gmail-mat-expansion-panel-header-3" aria-controls="cdk-accordion-child-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-disabled="false"><span><span><b>It Reduces Food Waste</b></span></span></span></span></span></span>

standalone immersion circulator heats the water and circulates it
evenly across the pot. They take up very little space, as they don't
have a built-in water bath. Furthermore, they do not require any
additional equipment and you can easily clamp and adjust it on the side
of a pot you already own. Examples of some renowned manufacturers of
Sous VIde immersion circulators include Sansaire, ChefSteps, Anova,
Nomiku, and Joule.&nbsp;

is not just a flavoring agent. It can also dissolve muscle proteins and

<span><div><h4>Temperature Control in Sous Vide</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Meats
have a very special place in the Sous Vide method of cooking. However,
it is essential that the meat is cooked, that keeps all of its nutrition
and taste. This also means making the meat safe to consume, which
cannot be achieved without adequate temperature control. Let's begin&nbsp;by
understanding the cooking of bagged food kept in the freezer for a long
time.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Is It Okay to Cook Bagged Food Taken Out From the Freezer Immediately?</div></span><span style="max-width:18%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_178.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:73%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Cooking
the bagged food taken out from the freezer should not pose any problem
during the Sous Vide process. However, giving it some extra time to get
thawed can be beneficial during the cooking process. If you take a thick
steak or chop from the freezer, give it at least thirty minutes to
thaw. Similarly, chicken breasts or small shrimp can get thawed within
15 minutes.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Chilling and Reheating the Food for Sous Vide</div></span><span style="max-width:97%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">When
you make your food pass through the first session of Sous Vide cooking
higher temperature for several hours, the contents of your sealed bag
almost become sterile. This implies that rapid chilling (from an ice
bath) and rapid reheating must not pose significant health risks.
However, quick-cooking meats, such as chops, chicken breasts, fish,
shrimp, etc., can become dry because of this repeated heating and
cooling. Henceforth, it is highly recommended to cook such foods
immediately before your sear

and searing the meat creates a layer of crust over the meat, providing
it with a crispy and tasty outer layer. In traditional cooking methods,
meat is often seared after initial cooking (or frying).&nbsp;But if you want
to prepare a Sous Vide meat and sear it twice, i.e., before placing it
in the Sous Vide bag and after taking it out, then you must know that it
does not produce any significant changes in the taste. Pre-searing
(searing the meat before placing it into the bag) can overcook the meat
from its outer edges.

recommend against using a blow torch directly on the meat to sear it.
Doing so will cause uneven browning and crisping of the meat. Besides,
the naked flame from a butane or propane torch provides the meat with a
gasoline-like aroma that can be unpleasant. However, if you use a
pre-heated skillet&nbsp;while searing the meat, then combusting the fuel from
the torch would become easier. Also, the fat and juices in the pan will
nullify the effect of any uncombusted fuel still left over in the pan.

Should the Meat be Seasoned with Salt:&nbsp;Storing the meat with salt for a
long time can alter its texture. If you want to season beef with salt,
use&nbsp;salt immediately before or after cooking (and before searing).&nbsp;<br></li><li>Managing
Variable Time Ranges: You can cook your meal above 130°F (or 54°C) for
longer hours, as it will not pose any significant health risks. However,
you must avoid cooking longer than four hours below 130°F temperature.&nbsp;</li><li>Addition
of Aromatics to Sous Vide Bag: Regarding the addition of aromatics to
the Sous Vide bag, you must remember that not everyone will like the
concentrated flavors of these spices and herbs. Therefore, you should
look for alternatives, such as using garlic powder in place of garlic
or&nbsp;adding herbs and aromatics in the pan after searing the meat.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Searing the Meat in Sous Vide<ul><li>Place the raw meat in the bag.</li><li>Make it go through the Sous VIde process.</li><li>Sear it after the Sous Vide procedure has been done.</li></ul></div></span></div></div>

ideal sources are classified into an ideal voltage source and an ideal
current source. For an ideal voltage source the value of internal
resistance Rs = 0. For an ideal current source the value of internal
resistance Rs = ∞.</li><li>Source transformation is a conversion of a
voltage source into a current source and a current source into a voltage
source. It is useful for solving circuits.</li><li>A voltage source in
series with a resistor is transformed into a current source with
resistors connected in parallel. Similarly, the current source in
parallel gets transformed into a voltage source with resistors connected
in series.</li><li>A current source is an independent source that
supplies the same current to a wide range of resistances connected
across its terminals. The current source is the dual of a voltage
source.</li><li>There are two types of parallel connections. They are
the Parallel aiding current sources and the Parallel opposing current
sources.</li><li>Microelectronics use DC supply for their operation.
This is because these circuits mainly consist essentially of transistors
like static devices for switching and control operation. The logic
circuits require DC supply.</li><li>There are two types of active circuit elements (electrical sources), namely, <br>- the voltage source, and <br>- the current source.</li><li>An ideal voltage source is an active element that can supply and maintain the same voltage across its terminals

In DC circuits mesh is used only for resistive circuits.</li><li>Mesh is defined as a closed path that does not contain any other loops within it.</li><li>The
advantage of mesh analysis is that it will reduce the number of
equations required to solve the circuits for current and voltage. Mesh
analysis employs Kirchhoff's voltage law to solve the planar circuits.</li><li>The
node voltage can also be used with networks containing complex
impedances. In an N node network, the common terminal or ground terminal
is chosen as the Reference node.</li><li>Node analysis is a useful
technique to solve the voltage across various elements of a circuit. In
the nodal analysis, independent voltages are solved by writing
Kirchhoff’s current law.</li><li>The star-delta transformations are used
to establish, equivalence for networks with three terminals. The three
elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is
eliminated by transforming the resistances.</li><li>For equivalence, the resistance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks.</li><li>Benefits
of 3-phase systems include constant power delivery and that smaller
conductors are required for connecting three-phase equipment.<br></li><li>Cramer's
rule is a rule

that “an entire AC network, exclusive of the load, can be replaced by
an equivalent circuit that contains only an independent voltage source
in series with impedance such that the output voltage and current remain
same across the load”.</li><li>Norton's theorem (DC) states that “any
electrical circuit consisting of voltage sources, current sources and
resistors with two terminals is electrically equivalent to an ideal
current source in parallel with a single equivalent resistor".</li><li>Norton's
Theorem (AC) states that “any electrical circuit consisting of voltage
sources, current sources and impedances is electrically equivalent to an
ideal current source in parallel with single equivalent impedance”.</li><li>The
maximum power transfer theorem states that to obtain maximum power from
a source with a finite internal resistance of the load must be equal to
the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals.<br></li><li>The
MPT theorem can be extended to alternating current circuits having
reactance. Therein, it states that maximum power transfer occurs when
the load impedance is equal to the source impedance.<br></li><li>In any complex electrical circuit, network analysis helps in simplifying the circuits.<br></li><li>Tellegen's theorem can be applied to lumped networks consisting of time variant, time-invariant, linear, non-linear</li><li>,

destructions and accidents are prevalent globally. Despite implementing
strict fire-safety laws and regulations, compliance remains poor, and
there's a lot of work left that needs to be done in this regard. Fires
can incur heavy losses to human lives as well as infrastructure.
Households and companies have to bear hefty losses, and millions of
dollars are spent every year compensating for the damages. The situation
is so grave that even developed countries like the U.S. face the
consequences of fire-related incidents due to inadequate fire safety
measures.</div></span><span style="max-width:18%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_218.png" alt=""></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The following statistics show the damages and destructions caused by the fire alone in the US in 2020:

substantial financial and infrastructural losses in the places they
occur. What is essential in this scenario is that the losses due to fire
occur worldwide, despite implementing stringent laws and regulations to
curb the fire hazards.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">In
this scenario, hiring a fire safety management professional remains
among the top priority of businesses and enterprises. This is because
the enterprises always want to ensure that their fire safety management
is robust. Leaving any loopholes in their fire risk protection systems
can cause them losses worth millions of dollars. If a fire occurs in the
premises of these buildings, not only do they incur monetary and
infrastructural losses, but they also lose their reputation among the
general public.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">What are the responsibilities of a Fire Safety Professional?</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>They

to fire safety regulations, a building should be compartmentalized into
manageable areas. Specialists will take special care of these
manageable areas by installing fire doors, walls, and other cavity
barriers to stop the passage of smoke.<br>Fire protection boards also
constitute an important part of compartmentation. They absorb heat and
do not shrink at high temperatures. Similarly, fire-stopping solutions
seal the service penetrations. In case a fire breaks out in a
compartment, the insulation of the surrounding compartment confines high
temperatures and smoke to a specific area.<br>The final aim of
compartmentation is to limit the spread of heat, smoke, and fire. This
method also ensures the protection of the entire escape routes.

best way to prevent electricity-related fire incidents in households is
to hire a qualified electrician to change your house's wiring. You
should also keep an eye on the electrical cords and ensure that they do
not run under the carpets or across the doorways, as they can get
damaged in these places, and you would not get notified. You should also
limit the number of electrical plugs in your electrical outlet.
Overloading of these outlets can trip a breaker and start a fire. Also,
the light bulbs in your house should match the recommended wattage
designated for each bulb.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Other Necessary Precautions for Avoiding Short Circuit</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Replacing

with an upgraded version</li><li>Another necessary precaution you must
take regarding your electrical equipment and appliances is keeping them
away from water. Many appliances, such as juicers, water dispensers, and
grinders, are commonly used near water. Therefore, it is best to stay
alert while using these appliances</li><li>&nbsp;All of your outlets near the
water source must be GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters)
receptacles. These GFCI receptacles can quickly shut off the power if

mechatronics, gears are used to reduce speed and increase the torque of
mechanical components such as a motor. Also,&nbsp;bearings are to guide
mechanical components with minimum friction.<br><br><b>Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators</b><br>An

motors are similar to induction motors except that they have a rotor, a

a relatively new science, going back to fourteen or fifteen century.
For some people, Robotics is a hobby. For others, it is a science
fiction genre. For some, it is an engineering discipline or industrial
technology. <i>Robotics is also a controversial subject</i>, often misrepresented in popular media.<br><br>No single definition can satisfy such a variety of perspectives and interests as those of Robotics. <b>Robotics is the intelligence connection of perception to action </b><br>The history of robotics started with <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>&nbsp;who, in 1495, designed a mechanical device that looked like an armoured knight. In 1920, the Czechoslovakian playwright <i>Karel Capec</i>
introduced the word “Robot” in the play “Rossum’s Universal Robots”.
The word came from the Czech “Robota”, meaning “tedious labour”. <br>According to Issac Asimov, <i>three fundamental laws regulates Robotics</i>:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>First Law</b>: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li><li><b>Second Law</b>: A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li><li><b>Thi</b>

robotics, degrees of freedom is often used to describe the number of
directions that a robot can move a joint. A robot that has mechanisms to
control all the six physical degrees of freedom is said to be <b>holonomic</b>. An object with fewer controllable degrees of freedom than the total degrees of freedom are said to be <b>non-holonomic</b> and an object with more controllable degrees of freedom than the total degrees of freedom is said to be <b>redundant</b>.<br>A
manipulator consists of joints and links. Joints provide relative
motion. Links are rigid members between joints. There are various joint
types, linear and rotary. Each joint provide a “degree of freedom”. Most
robots possess five or six degrees of freedom <br><b>A robot manipulator consists of two sections: </b></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li><i>Body and arm</i> – for positioning of objects in the robot’s work volume</li><li><i>Wrist assembly </i>– for the orientation of objects</li></ul></div></span></div></div>

<span><div><h4>Presentation</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">It
is recommended that you use graphs to improve presentation and
understanding of information. This presentation may be assisted by
computer programs. They may be interspersed between paragraphs as they
become relevant to the particular accounting task. There is no doubt
graphs add to the report and help the explanation. I would further
recommend the use of graphs when carrying out trend analysis. The
plotting of a series of graphs over several years for each of the
profitability measures may more clearly show changes in profitability.<br>The
problem with using graphs is that you will often rely on the graph
alone. While this does identify the change which has taken place it does
not necessarily show the amount involved. To fully satisfy the
particular criteria you may have to explain why the change has taken
place.</div></span><span style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_039.jpg" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:52%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
use of horizontal and vertical variance analysis is encouraged. Like
graphs they tend to focus your response, however, they share the common
problem with graphs, of identifying but not explaining.<br><br>It is
very important that you support graphs with an explanation. You are
invariably required to give 'reasons for the change'. It is also
important to note that 'the reasons must be relevant to the hypothetical

of the key ratios is again important. It is easy to use a multitude of
'gearing' ratios, however, only one is necessary. Most people favour
liabilities to total assets as a measure of gearing.<br>The references
are not consistent in their definition of ratio items. For instance,
some define the rate of return ratio using "owner's equity" whilst
others use 'average owner's equity'. Either is acceptable providing you
are consistent in the application of these measures. Where relevant you
should use an 'average' figure.<br>Two other possible ratios to use are:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:center"><b>debt ratio = Interest bearing debt/total assets</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>interest coverage ratio = Net cash flow from operations + interest/interest expense</b></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">It
is important that you graph the ratios stated above along with
liabilities: total assets. The movement of these ratios must be
explained and, if provided, compared with a benchmark.<br>By referring to the financial reports you should attempt to explain why changes have occurred.<br>Before
condemning a business in respect of it's long term stability check the
nature of the non-current assets. If these assets have been acquired
some time ago and are shown at historical cost then it may be possible
that they are considerably understated in value, which means the gearing
situation is not as bad as it appears.

("first in - first out") and identified cost are approaches to
measuring the "cost" of stock on hand at the end of the accounting
period. The problem occurs when stock is bought in batches during the
period at different prices. The business must decide which stock is on
hand from which batch.<br>FIFO method - cost of units removed from
inventory is assumed to be from the first units available for sale at
the time of each sale.<br>Identified cost is where the particular batch
from which goods are sold is identified. This is relevant when batches
of goods are bought at different prices and the identification of actual
cost price is considered important. It is possible for items from
different batches to be sold in the one transaction. Identification of
individual stock items is made possible by electronic measuring devices

<b>Balance day adjustments </b>- When using the 'Asset' approach to 
expense recognition the initial payment is treated as an asset rather 
than an expense.&nbsp;<br><br>When
balance day adjustments are made using the 'expense approach' the
payment or receipt is initially treated as an expense or revenue. That
portion of the payment, or revenue not used or received, at the end of
the accounting period, is then treated as an asset or a liability.<br><br><b>Depreciation</b>
is defined as the allocation of the cost of a non-current asset over
the economic life of that asset. It is charged at the end of each
accounting period. At the end of each accounting period depreciation
accumulates and it is the 'Accumulated depreciation' account, which is
posted to the Balance sheet as a deduction from the relevant non-current
asset.<br><br><b>The cash budget</b> is a report designed to show

<span><div><h4>What are Critical Operations?</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Critical
Operations are just that—actions, processes, and systems that enable
the execution of the integral functions of a business or organization.
Simply put, the litmus test to identify&nbsp;Critical Operations&nbsp;can be: if
this "thing"—a specific task, process, or system—broke or stopped
working, would this hinder or cripple the continued ability of the
organization to meet its goals?<br>Critical Operations&nbsp;are classified as
such because of their functions within an integral system, not their
standalone characteristics. For instance, the emergency generator at an
air traffic control tower is absolutely mission critical, whereas a
backup generator for your local sporting goods store is not. The
consequences of the same component failing are vastly different: the
loss of the former during a power outage poses a tremendous, imminent
threat to the safe landing of airplanes, but the loss of the latter
during a power outage will probably only result in the store closing
early and losing some sales. The two are simply not comparable in the
severity of their impact.<br>There are some systems and processes that
are fairly unique to&nbsp;Critical Operations&nbsp;because they create reliability
and safety for the systems and processes crucial to the success of the
larger entity. Regardless of how commonplace or unique the component may
be,&nbsp;Critical Operations&nbsp;are united by the fact they are the fundamental
building blocks that allow an organization to deliver a service with
little or no possibility for error, downtime, or any other type of
interruption.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NZebi-_OWzUGZUGZ4wHmD2D92NMRMEa7oZd1mEhMpbeM-Njw24NU0phXUQ7" alt="Fig. 1.1"></div></span>

the possible threats posed to the people, property, or systems within a
critical facility is an important part of both the design and
implementation of critical operations. Within reason, you should always
assess the potential threats to critical operations and plan for as many
as is practical. This is equally important in design, construction, and
day-to-day sustained operations within a facility.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">In a <b>critical facility,</b>
there is almost never a single piece of equipment—or even one,
stand-alone system—that constitutes the whole of the facility’s critical
operations. Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of a
system as a set of interconnected "things" or components that come
together to form a more complex whole. A fundamental building block of
critical operations is simply understanding that these components, in
any combination, come together to create a more complicated system that
serves a mission critical purpose.&nbsp;<br>Within a facility, these various
systems work together to perform critical functions and are often

all the in-depth planning and design that goes into bringing a critical
installation online, and as skilled as its operators may be, emergency
situations still arise—it's inevitable. Hence, the necessity for crisis
management: the planning and monitoring for and the immediate response
to any potential threat.<br>It is vital to have well-thought-out crisis
management plans that operations teams are trained on and comfortable
with. Writing scripts for every possible scenario is highly impractical,
if not impossible, but consistent plans to respond to situations, to
establish a path towards stability, and to connect the right resources

right problem needs to be addressed and it needs to be fixed. Plans and
procedures should be followed to determine things like: How did this
begin? Are there other conditions (e.g., alarms, faults, etc.) that
we're not seeing? What resources are available? And, what is the status
of all our systems?&nbsp;</li><li><b>Crisis Action Plan -&nbsp;</b>With answers to
the preceding questions, the crisis management leader should begin to
enact and/or develop action plans. This spans the range from completing
triage activities, to incident notification protocols, to marshaling
resources for permanent repairs, to establishing the level of
sensitivity or urgency under which these actions are to take place.
Depending upon the environment, formal crisis response activities may
continue on until every single fault or failure is addressed, whereas
other facilities simply want to restore operations, even under temporary
conditions, and document the go-forward plan.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Crisis Termination -&nbsp;</b>Again,
putting a stop to the crisis response varies by industry and
application, but generally falls into the two approaches just mentioned:
maintain the crisis response posture until all systems, equipment, and
operations are fully restored or repaired, or release this posture once
the threat to operational availability has been neutralized and the
crisis leadership is comfortable with the documented remediation plans.&nbsp;</li></ol></div></span></div></div>

now includes terrestrial, satellite, and wireless transmission systems.
And, more so, these various transmission types have become
interconnected, working together to provide seamless, end-to-end
transmissions across different communication media.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, many

regard to the prevention of and remediation of risk resulting from both
man-made and natural incidences. In addition to protecting an&nbsp;entire
nation in the event of an emergency, it also carries the heavy burden of
serving as the first line of defense for the remaining critical
infrastructure sectors.&nbsp;<br>This includes a wide array of response
functions in an emergency, but primarily it is responsible for
protecting people, property, and the environment; providing assistance
to those affected by the emergency event; and providing recovery

you think of the term "power," you may think first of the utility lines
that provide us with the energy needed to keep the lights and your
electronic devices powered on and working. And, as you know, power is
one of the utilities necessary for keeping Critical Operations up and
running. But what you may not know are the fundamental concepts of
power: what power is and how it works.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_147.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Electricity</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Electricity
is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the
static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged
particles. The electricity that is most relevant to the discussion of
power and power sources is the latter, known as current electricity
since it flows between objects or places. A good analogy for this kind
of electricity is water in a hose: when the water is turned on, pressure
is applied to the water at one end of the hose and pushes it out the
other end. Electricity works similarly: electrically charged particles
flow from one end—say, a power generator—and come out on the other
end—perhaps the lights in your house.<br>But electricity is also a
concept that encompasses all aspects about the accumulation or flow of

are very few purely mechanical systems in use today that do not require
some sort of electrical power. It is, therefore, possible to state that
all critical systems in Critical Operations rely upon electrical power.
The degree, however, to which equipment needs constant availability of
power, or a certain quality of power is a differentiating factor.&nbsp;<br>Some
systems are energy hogs but are not highly sensitive to ebbs and flows
in the power supply, while some other systems use only a small amount of
electricity but have little or no tolerance for any fluctuation in the
quality of power supplied.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:18%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_025.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:72%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">One
example of a critical system that relies on the constant availability
of power would be a computer-based system, like a data center, in which
the components are highly sensitive to a constant supply of electricity
at a specific voltage. The concern here is that any interruption, no
matter how momentary, can cause a hiccup in the function of a delicate
high-speed motor component, which would then cause ripple effects
throughout other Critical Operations. Loss of data or continuity of data
are both a great concern for all the electronic and digitally
controlled systems in place today.&nbsp;</div></span></div></div>

learn about electricity is from the bottom up: beginning with the
characteristics of the flowing electrons (speed &amp; </div></span>
<span style="max-width:60%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
other form of Critical Operation electrical systems particularly
concerned with the constant availability of power are those with complex
or extended start-up cycle times.&nbsp;<br>Plenty of Critical Operations
have sufficient tolerance or backup plans to handle a system going
offline for a few seconds or a minute; for instance, an emergency
communications/command center could temporarily allow data to be routed
elsewhere and rely upon the most recent information or view information
from another location to continue making decisions and move operations
forward.&nbsp;<br>But, bringing all of these systems back online, in the
proper sequence and with the proper security considerations in place,
might actually take hours or days to complete. In this case, those two
seconds of power drop begin to cripple Critical Operations for an
extended period of time.</div></span><span style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NaKQyqWMQ_V70DEi9Y7OcNLIJq2DAu3FYlQ_6KaEUswP6Gl7IzKdNSIt2XL" alt="Fig 2.1"><div> Fig 2.1 </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:12%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_168.png" alt=""></div></span><span><div><h4>Case Study 6: Power Loss and Preparation</h4></div></span>

the process of removing excess electrical charge and distributing it to
a larger body capable of receiving that charge. Most commonly, that
charge is sent down to the earth via a conductor.<br>&nbsp;<br>The easiest
way to think about grounding is lightning itself. The atmosphere and
clouds accumulate charged particles due to the changing weather
conditions. The charge then finds the earth as a happy receptor for all
of that energy. Now consider the use of lightning rods: where the
lightning bolt was an uncontrolled discharge of these particles, a
lightning rod can be used to accept the excess charge and purposefully
move that current through a conductor safely to the ground.

automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a particularly helpful component
that acts as an independent traffic director of sorts, to ensure that
power is being supplied from the most optimal source available. While
ATSs exist in many places throughout Critical Operations installations,
ATSs at the main utility input are of unique importance since they
perform a few extra duties.&nbsp;<br>Think of an ATS as a<b> “Y” gate,</b>
with the top of the Y connecting to two different power sources; in this
case, the utility-source and the generator. The bottom of the Y heads
off to whatever load is being supported. The ATS has two main parts: a
control panel and the switch. The control panel is always monitoring
power quality signals from both sources and is programmed to have a
primary and alternate source.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:36%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbPAoKdbnUu37JwmSwvIQqaRvN603qIqGPs4pv1WNO_i12Xj-Egdec6e9TW" alt="Fig. 2-13: A diagram of an automatic transfer switch (ATS).">

or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but
without the automatic control features. Some switches still have control
panels that will provide an alert or alarm when conditions reach set
thresholds, although they will require an operator to physically make
the transfer.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Paralleling Switchgear</div></span><span style="max-width:42%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Paralleling switchgear </b>are
large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit
breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the
electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice
versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout
the system. Specifically, they are used to switch the power source for
the load, provide load sharing capabilities, operate the generator,
meter the output, and protect the generator from any potential
malfunctions.
aralleling switchgear is an especially vital component for Critical
Operations with multiple backup generators, specifically because of its
multiple moving parts.&nbsp;<br>Think of it this way: generators are rotating
machines, providing an AC output of a certain frequency, voltage, and
waveform. Since it is constantly in flux—say, 60 Hz, or 60 cycles of the
waveform every second—you can imagine how difficult it could be to
match two "moving" AC sources from multiple power supplies. Closing the
AC output from the generator to transfer it to the facility bus with AC
power still running through it will have disastrous consequences if the
two AC signals are not closely matched: most likely, an explosion!&nbsp;<br>Modern
paralleling switchgear is controlled electronically by logic boards to
remove the need for operators to be standing at the switchgear, manually
closing the breakers. Until the generator output breaker has closed to
support the Critical Operations load, it is the variable source, and the
control boards in the switchgear will usually make minor tweaks to the
speed of the engine in order to align the AC waveforms

now, you have a strong understanding of the two main types of power
that can be provided to your Critical Operations: the consistent power
supplied from the utility-source and the backup power supplied from a
generator. These are likely the two sources you are most familiar with,
just from day-to-day use; you may have even used a generator before to
supply power to your own home. But, there is another source of backup
power that is a commonly-used, critical component of any Critical
Operation: an uninterruptible power supply.&nbsp;<br>As a facilities
operator, it is imperative that you understand the purpose of an
uninterruptible power supply and be able to choose between the different
types that are available in order to best serve your Critical
Operations. In this topic, you will identify the types of
uninterruptible power supplies.
<span><div><h4>UPS</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:96%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">An <b>uninterruptible power supply (UPS)</b>
is a device or machine that provides immediate emergency power when the
primary power source fails, using electrical energy stored within the
device itself. UPSs are a critical component of a Critical Operations
power system because they are designed to provide clean and continuous
power to Critical Operations during power interruptions and eliminate
abnormal fluctuations from the power source as delivered.</div></span><span style="max-width:48%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Electricity
delivered from the utility power source is never “clean power,” often
experiencing spikes, sags, and occasional interruptions. These power
abnormalities can wreak havoc on the IT load and other critical
equipment serving Critical Operations and even severely damage them.
UPSs protect these systems by providing temporary backup power for brief
outages and absorbing those spikes and sags, ensuring the power
delivered is within acceptable tolerances and specification for critical
consumption. UPSs are not designed to sustain power supply for long
periods of time, but rather long enough to engage another alternative
source of power, such as a power generator, to accept the electrical
load. <br></div><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><br></div><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">

vary in design and method of application, but the basic function of a
UPS follows the same principle. A UPS accepts AC power from the provided
source, stores a portion of the energy in a backup battery system, and
delivers the remaining to the critical connected equipment. In order to
perform this vital function, the UPS requires three key components: a
charger/rectifier, a battery or other storage mechanism <b>(typically, a flywheel)</b>,
and an inverter. The charger/rectifier converts the input AC power to
DC power for battery charging, and the inverter converts the battery
power to AC power during a power interruption.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span><div><h4>Flywheels</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">As
an alternative to a battery system, flywheels can be used with a UPS to
support continuous power requirements. A flywheel is a <b>mechanical-type storage device</b>
that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis. The
electrical input spins the flywheel rotor up to speed where it remains<b> fully charged in stand-by mode</b>,
24/7, until a power interruption requires its activation. When this
occurs, the flywheel provides back-up power immediately, while the
system monitors for proper electrical input. If this condition persists
for a specified time frame measured in seconds, the system transfers to a
more permanent power source such as the backup generator system.&nbsp;<br>This
technology is relatively cost-effective and environmentally friendly as
opposed to the traditional lead acid battery system. Although the
initial cost of batteries is relatively low, the cost of maintaining,
replacing, and disposing of batteries over the long term must be taken
into consideration. Flywheel technology can also work alongside a
battery system if desired, and is highly effective at absorbing the
abnormal electrical inputs as the first line of defense, thus prolonging
the life of the storage batteries.
<span><div><h4>Line Interactive UPS</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>A line interactive UPS </b>combines
the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC
power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its
output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit.&nbsp;<br>This
system limits transient voltages when switching and increases the speed
of the changeover from main power to backup battery power. Because of
this design, a line inverter UPS does not have to resort to batteries as
often as other systems; instead, it utilizes some of its battery power
only to support the transition from normal mode to voltage regulation
mode.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_084.png" alt="Fig. 2.16 - A schematic of a line interactive UPS, showing how it operates (or doesn't operate)at various levels of voltage."><div> Fig. 2.16 - A schematic of a line interactive UPS, showing how it operates (or doesn't operate)at various levels of voltage</div></div></span>

all AC power to DC power, some of which is utilized for battery
charging, while the rest is simply converted back to AC power to provide
power to the critical load. The double conversion aims to prevent any
possibility of an abnormal power event reaching the equipment
downstream.&nbsp;<br>Although the double conversion method is highly
successful in providing continuous power from outages and power quality
anomalies, it is also less efficient due to the power loss during the
conversion process and the generation of additional heat, which creates a
higher demand on the cooling systems.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:16px;text-align:left">Delta Conversion UPS</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>The delta conversion UPS</b>
was designed to address some of the issues of a double conversion UPS,
and therefore has a few similarities. Like the double conversion UPS,
the inverter in a delta conversion UPS is <b>always supplying the load voltage</b>;
however, it also uses a special transformer configuration to interface
between the utility supplied power and the electrical load.&nbsp;<br>A
“delta” converter in the transformer regulates the input current and
power and also delivers power to the inverter output. During normal

diesel rotary UPS combines a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS
with a diesel generator to supply backup power for the load. It actually
consists of five key components:<b>&nbsp;a motor generator, flywheel, choke, mechanical clutch, and a diesel engine.&nbsp;</b><br>Under
normal and uninterrupted conditions, the local utility power is fed to
the critical equipment load via the choke and motor sub-system,
otherwise known as the filter. This same source of power also feeds the
flywheel to retain kinetic energy storage capability in the event of a
power interruption. When utility supplied power is interrupted,
alternate power is supplied by the rotating flywheel to the motor
generator unit, which provides adequate power for a few seconds until
the diesel engine can start and accelerate to full speed. At this point
the clutch is engaged, enabling mechanical power to be supplied to the
motor generator to sustain continuous electricity to the critical load.&nbsp;<br>In most cases, diesel rotary UPSs are a<b>&nbsp;fixed asset and are rarely modular</b>.&nbsp;Future
growth relating to power requirements must be considered upon the
initial engineering calculations to ensure capabilities are somewhat
oversized. Since these are diesel powered, special ventilation and
purging equipment for fumes may be required, as well as potentially
constructing a separate building or enclosures to support these system</div></span>

an engineering method to keep the output of two independent UPSs in
sync, even if they are operating from two different sources of supplied
power. In general, a UPS in a multiple-UPS system will automatically
sync to its own bypass source, as long as all of the UPSs are tied to
the same input source. However, imagine if these UPSs were operating off
of different back-up generators, batteries, or another bypass source.
In these scenarios, their outputs will always tend to drift out of sync
and cause problems within the electrical load.&nbsp;<br>The LBS system
functions by continuously monitoring the sync reference signals of two
UPS modules. It remains in a dormant state until the output of the UPS
modules drift out of predetermined operational parameters—or out of
sync—at which point the LBS activates and manipulates the output of each
UPS module until they once again fall in sync with each other. Once
completed, the LBS once again returns to its dormant state of operation.</div></span></div></div>

is a device that converts stored chemical energy into electricity via a
process in which free electrons move between a positively charged
terminal (called a<b> cathode</b>) and a negatively charged terminal (called an <b>anode</b>) through a solution favorable to this process (called the <b>electrolyte</b>). All of these things together, within a container, is called a<b> jar or cell </b>(although some battery designs include multiple sets of terminals such that one jar may have several cells within it).&nbsp;<br>There
are numerous types of batteries which are differentiated based on the
materials used for the cathode, anode, and the electrolyte (as well as a
few other secondary variables).<br>&nbsp;<br>A battery system is simply a
set, or sets, of individual battery cells wired together in strings in
order to achieve higher voltages, capacities, or redundancies.<br>For much of history, the type of batteries that were being used were what would be considered <b>primary batteries,</b>
meaning they were really only useful for one full discharge before
having to be scrapped or have at least one component replaced. With the
advent of <b>r</b><b>echargeable,</b><b> or secondary batteries</b>, a 
charge could be applied to the battery which would convert the 
electricity back to chemical energy to store for future use.&nbsp;<br>In
Critical Operations, only the latter type of battery system is
typically used, and therefore these types of batteries will be focused
on here.</div></span></div></div>

acid batteries are widely prevalent and come in many options available
for commercial/ industrial scale usage in MCOs. In a lead acid battery,
the <b>positive terminal</b> is made of lead-oxide (PbO<sub>2</sub>), the <b>negative terminal</b> is made of lead (Pb), and the electrolyte solution that fills the container is some concentration of sulfuric-acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The chemical reaction amongst the three components produces the voltage for the battery.&nbsp;<br><b>Flooded wet cell batteries</b>
are the original form of lead acid batteries and simply have the
cathode and anode fully submerged in the electrolyte solution. The top
of the battery is covered, with the terminals protruding for connection,
and two ports: a vent and a fill port. As part of the chemical reaction
releasing and storing energy in the battery, the acid (in this case, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and some water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecules are broken apart, releasing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)
gasses. This gas needs to be vented in order to prevent
over-pressurization of the battery, hence the need for the vent. Some of
the solution can also evaporate over time, so to maintain the cathode
and anode fully submerged, de-ionized water may need to be added to the
jar from time to time.&nbsp;<br><b>Valve Regulated Lead Acid batteries (VRLA) </b>are
an advancement of lead-acid battery technology and have been in wide
use for decades now. This battery design utilizes a specialized one-way
pressure release valve, only releasing gasses when pressure is actually
beginning to rise to certain levels (whereas the flooded wet cell tends
to release most all gas produced). By forcing the gasses to stay within
the jar, they become re-absorbed by the solution, attach to the cathode
and/or anode, and through ionic exchange reactions, form water again.
This is a process commonly referred to as recombinant technology and
delivers two main benefits: increased safety protection from
over-pressurization and/or dangerous gas release, as well as virtually
eliminating the need to ever refill a jar.</div></span></div></div>

In a fuel cell, the chemical reaction occurs where the three segments
interface, such that the fuel is consumed, water or other gases are
created as a waste product, and an electric current is produced. As long
as the sources are supplied, the fuel cell will continue to produce
electrical energy.&nbsp;<br>The most common and familiar type of fuel cell is likely the<b> hydrogen fuel cell,</b> which requires hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) fuel and air (O<sub>2</sub>) as the sources. During the chemical reaction at the segments, some O<sub>2</sub> molecules are stripped from the air and some are stripped from the water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecules, leaving more H<sub>2</sub> to act as fuel.

be an expensive capital investment but have relatively low cost of

radiation each day to equal about seven times the amount of total global

the sun's energy and provide a clean, renewable source of electric power

from the lack of efficiency, the current limiting factor for solar
power production and usage is real estate. Panels simply take up a lot
of linear space, so their viability as an alternative energy source
depends largely upon how deep the owner or developer's pockets are.&nbsp;<br>Whether
you are deciding between implementing solar panels as input to a local
grid or as on-site supplemental power, the decision factors are largely
the same. PV manufacturing technology has improved sufficiently enough
in the last decade that construction and labor costs are the major
variables that may provide economies of scale; the PV cells/panels
themselves have become quite affordable in relation to the overall
investment.&nbsp;<br>However, much like microprocessors changed the face of
electronics and computing, the next breakthrough in solar technology
will certainly bring it to the forefront of most power planning
discussions. If solar technology can reach a point where it is capable
of generating two to four times the amount of power on the same amount
of land (or the same power in a fraction of the footprint), <b>solar power could rival hydroelectric power </b>as a leader in renewable energy production.&nbsp;<br>For
Critical Operations in particular, it is important to keep in mind
that—even without a solution to grid-scale power storage
limitations—creating solar power is nearly free (minus the initial
capital investment) to generate during daylight hours when strains on
the utility grid and electricity prices are highest.</div></span></div></div>

drive steam or gas turbines to create electricity.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_124.png" alt="Fig. 2.22 - The biomass plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina burns forest residue to provide power to the rest of the campus, which produces nuclear materials for the U.S.Department of Energy."><div> Fig. 2.22 - The biomass plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina burns forest residue to</div></div></span>
While the by-products of biomass are not quite as bad as coal or other fossil fuel plants, <b>burning is still burning</b>;
in this regard, biomass should be considered a cleaner alternative
energy than some of the others, speaking strictly from the energy
production process.&nbsp;<br>However, if you take into account the fact that
much of the biomass fuel sources are often headed for landfills, or
require additional energy to recycle or treat, removing these items from
the waste chain does actually have a notably positive effect on the
environment.<br>Currently, the largest hurdle for biomass power plants is the <b>fuel supply chain</b>.
There is certainly no shortage of fuel products, but industries have
not been fully established to process these sources in a manner
desirable for a particular plant design.&nbsp;<br>Plant designs can be easily
modified for any primary source, or combination of fuels, but once it's
built, it's committed. While many large-scale biomass power plants also
process their own fuel onsite, it is simply not practical to build
processing capabilities for all types of biomass sources; as a result,
most biomass plants usually stick to producing the one or two sources
that are the most heavily used in the serviceable area

some fuel source (nuclear, coal, gas, biomass, etc.) is used to create
steam for turbine generators, and then the leftover heat is extracted
from the exhausted waste steam (or condensate) and is used to provide
power for other central services (such as space heating or water
heating).&nbsp;<br>Co-generation plants are an economical, if not thrifty,
alternative power source that is primarily found in campus settings
because of the ability to utilize the co-generated energy to power a
central service for multiple buildings on the site, if not the entire
campus.&nbsp;<br>While it is still not common for most Critical Operations
facilities to be generating their own primary power on site (with a few
large-scale exceptions), the co-generation concept is one that
facilility technicians and operators are finding great success in
implementing after the fact. <b>Anything that generates heat can be considered a candidate for co-generation.&nbsp;</b><br>For
instance, a communications center that finally decides to install a
solar array on the roof could then install a bypass loop to its hot
water heater and run tubes within or behind the array to collect its
heat. Or machinery with compressors or motors in a manufacturing plant
could be hooded in some manner, and ductwork could be put in place to
pump the hot air back into people spaces during colder months to augment
installed electric heaters.</div></span></div></div>

<span><div><h4>The main points from this module are as follows:</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>Electricity</b>
is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the
static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged
particles.</li><li><b>Voltage</b> is the potential difference in
electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more
plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the
amount of pressure pushing or pulling them.<br></li><li>A<b> volt</b>,
represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly
used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing
electricity.<br></li><li><b>Low voltage equipment</b> or systems can be
loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating
below regular residential voltage levels.<br></li><li><b>Medium voltage</b>
is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally
refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which
includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet
circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV).&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>High voltage</b>
commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15
kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment,
such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution
breakers.<br></li><li><b>Electrical current,</b> represented by the
letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a
circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire.</li></ul></div></span>
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>The most common sources that provide utility power: coal, <b>natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind.</b></li><li><b>A microgrid</b>
is a small-scale, localized utility-source system that can disconnect
from the larger, more traditional utility-source grid (i.e., the public
or privately-owned power plants and distribution centers) either
partially or completely.<br></li><li><b>A generator</b> is a machine used to convert mechanical energy of some kind into electrical energy.<br></li><li>An <b>automatic transfer switch (ATS)</b>
is a particularly helpful component that acts as an independent traffic
director of sorts, to ensure that power is being supplied from the most
optimal source available.<br></li><li><b>A throw-over switch</b>, or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but without the automatic control features.<br></li><li><b>Paralleling switchgear</b>
are large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit
breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the
electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice
versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout
the system.<br></li><li><b>A flywheel</b> is a mechanical-type storage device that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis.<br></li><li><b>A line interactive UPS </b>combines
the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC
power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its
output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit.<br></li><li><b>A double conversion UPS </b>converts
all AC power to DC power, some of which is utilized for battery
charging, while the rest is simply converted back to AC power to provide
power to the critical load</li></ul></div></span>

the ability to deliver the same desired critical operations while using
less energy, incurring lower costs (namely, utility costs), and/or
requiring less involvement or maintenance by specialized technicians.&nbsp;</b><br>Reducing
costs and improving efficiency are elements that are under the
microscope at every opportunity. From initial construction, operations,
and repair, it is always a balancing act of ensuring continuous
operations of the facility at a cost that is acceptable to the business.
To do so, many design engineers are increasingly choosing
medium-voltage power distribution over low-voltage power distribution
within their critical facilities.&nbsp;<br>In any power system, the larger
the load current and the larger the conductor resistance, the larger the
voltage drop between the utility-source and the distribution system. A
medium voltage distribution system helps to reduce drops in voltage from
the utility service to the load, therefore increasing the overall
effectiveness of the distribution system. Low voltage distribution
systems generally have much longer feeder runs and must be designed to
be oversized in an effort to compensate for the resistance of the
conductor; since medium voltage systems have a smaller load current and
reduced voltage drop, the necessity for oversized conductors can be
eliminated.&nbsp;<br>Utilizing medium voltage power distribution can also
reduce the upfront cost of copper conductors and installation as well as
the long term operating costs. This method provides the opportunity to
move the transformation of load power closer to the load itself to take
advantage of the reduced current at higher voltages. Lower current
equates to smaller and fewer copper conductors, thus reducing overall
costs.

it comes to providing power to your Critical Operations system, one of
the most important things you need to consider is how to ensure that
power is always being consistently supplied. As a facilities operator,
you will need to understand the concept of redundancy as a method for
maintaining stable power and distributing it appropriately throughout
your power system and selecting the appropriate scheme for your
facility's needs. In this topic, you will identify redundancy levels.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_050.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Redundancy</b>
refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that
may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional
capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of
critical equipment failure.&nbsp;<br><br>In the world of Critical Operations,
however, the concept of redundancy is much more multi-faceted than the
word “extra” implies. How many components of a system have redundancy?
Is it just extra capacity or really extra equipment? Does the extra
equipment sit idle in standby, or can it be used for non¬critical
functions until called upon in the event of a failure? To what extent
can a single fault take out the primary component and the redundant
component</div></span>

of the Critical Operations industries are converging towards a common
language regarding redundancy and the different variations, or levels,

you get down to the level of an individual piece of equipment,
redundancy can get a bit tricky. Utilizing a dual-cord supply scheme is
the most common approach for high-technology equipment and literally
refers to plugging that piece of equipment in twice.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbLYx29ZVKDU56_-ZuBz7fT6leDgzEpFXI3K026vd6fb_a5xlWLoDWHxz-M" alt="Fig. 3.7 - Rack-mounted servers in a data center utilize dual-cord supplies to provide power redundancy."><div> Fig. 3.7 - Rack-mounted servers in a data center utilize dual-cord supplies to provide power redundancy.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">When
utilizing dual-cord supply, there is a basic method and a preferred
method. In almost any piece of equipment, there is usually an internal
power supply of some sort behind the power cord connection that takes
the supplied power and converts it to what the machine needs to run on
(AC vs. DC, a particular voltage, wattage, etc.). The machine will
therefore need two of these.&nbsp;<br>The basic method to establish redundancy is to have this configuration and plug both cords into the same supply circuit. <b>The
preferred method is for each of these cords to be connected to separate
power circuits, so that there is redundancy if the machine's power
supply component fails, but also if one of the circuits in an MCO system
goes down.&nbsp;</b></div></span><span style="max-width:60%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">There are two situations where dual-cord supply is important and therefore often implemented:&nbsp;<b>with medical equipment and data center equipment.</b>&nbsp;Medical
equipment tops the list of candidates for dual-cord supply, simply
because there may be one or more lives at risk. Not all medical
equipment is highly sensitive to losing power for fractions of a second,
but if a life-support system or surgical device went offline for even a
few seconds or minutes, the results could be deadly.&nbsp;<br>Additionally,
when it comes to complex modern medical technologies, it's not just
about how long power is lost, but whether or not the start-up cycle time
for that equipment is lengthy enough to have equally terrible
consequences.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:31%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_046.jpg" alt="Fig. 3.8"><div> F</div></div></span>

lost for one second or milliseconds.&nbsp;<br>Lost data, lost transactions,
the risk of fail-over systems not picking up the load are all examples
of how millions of dollars can be lost all for the sake of not
installing an additional $50 power cord.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_049.jpg" alt="Fig. 3.9"></div></span>

equipment, after all. Taking steps to protect parts of systems, or other
systems, from nearby faults is how we take steps toward higher and
higher levels of reliability. In this vein, there are four different
topologies or "tiers" of design that are commonly used in power
distribution (and that are applicable to other system designs): basic,
redundant, concurrent maintainability, and fault tolerant. For
simplicity's sake, we'll look at each of these topologies using a single

a loss of power, all three generators would come online to power the
facility (most likely, but the logic could call for just two, keeping

the Critical Operations example, there would be<b> two sets of three 2.5 MW generators (for a total of six units), with each set having its own separate generator switchgear.</b>&nbsp;The
two units would most likely be connected by a normally closed

is the process of removing excess electrical charge from a component or
system and distributing it to a larger body capable of receiving that
charge. </b>When it comes to your power distribution system, grounding
is an extremely important concept, especially due to the higher voltages
that you may interact with at this level of the distribution chain.&nbsp;<br>In
addition to grounding measures in place throughout power distribution
systems as a whole, individual electrical equipment should have
grounding connections whenever possible to mitigate the risk of damage
to the equipment during faults and to disperse any excess charge for
personnel safety. In many cases, individual pieces of equipment may be
connected directly to those larger facility grounding systems. In this
situation, it is imperative that these connections are well-documented
and well-designed, so that the pathways of lower electrical potential
lead to the ground termination and not back to smaller equipment.&nbsp;<br>Equipment
may also be grounded locally if need be. For example, a PDU may be
located in a hall or closet somewhere between the switchgear and the
critical load, but not near the installed grounding system. In this
case, the PDU may be grounded to a piece of structural building steel,
or just a single copper rod sunk into the subfloor</div></span>

<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Over-current
protections can be instantaneous or over a predetermined, measured
period of time. For example, most motors have a notably higher starting
current than running current, so we don't want equipment tripping a
breaker just because there are twice as many amps as usual if the motor
equipment is shifting. So, on a PDU that is feeding mechanical
equipment, the design may call for the PDU to trip breakers
instantaneously at one hundred times the running current, or at
twenty-five times the running current and sustain it for three seconds.&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_170.png" alt=""></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Some
advanced logic controls may be able to analyze the occurrence and
determine if it is safe to close the breaker and rejoin back in to the
load, but the majority of Critical Operations personnel prefer to stick
with manual resets so that a technician has the chance to troubleshoot
the occurrence and make the determination whether or not a dangerous
condition still exists.
<span><div><h4>Protective Relays</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Protective relays are<b> electromagnetically or electronically operated devices </b>that
sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish
protective actions. More simply, these are the mechanical devices that
open and close breakers in response to undesirable conditions.&nbsp;<br>This
is generally the means by which breakers are tripped open during
protective features such as over-current. Protective relays may also be
controlled by logic as part of a response sequence, closing breakers for
alternate source after a primary source is tripped due to a fault
condition.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_NbN3r0ESnipdYcegqlFSNoPcctpq_hHm6WlIC1VbzZqlgA9WUv9nkt5YBhG" alt="Fig. 3.15 - Protective relays used to provide over-current protection at a power generating station."></div></span>
<span><div><h4>Surge Protection</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Just
like you might have a surge protector at home to protect your
electronic devices from harmful spikes in the power supply (typically in
the form of a surge-protected power strip), Critical Operations need a
form of surge protection to do the same for their critical components.&nbsp;<br><b>A Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) </b>is
the industrial equivalent to the surge protector power strip your home
electronics are plugged into, and provides electrical protection to
connected equipment by buffering and absorbing voltage spikes. There are
many variants of TVSS systems available to Critical Operations
designers, with a wide range of proprietary technologies (usually to
protect specific types of equipment or to mitigate specific types of
transients (i.e., momentary changes in the voltage).&nbsp;</div></span><span style="max-width:48%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">The
basic concept of surge protection—in addition&nbsp;to the specific
protections that individual equipment may have—is to have inline devices
throughout the power distribution system that act as energy diverters.
When a TVSS module senses a condition for which it is configured, it
uses some form of switch to quickly divert part or all of the excess
voltage away from the connected load, generally to a ground connection
<span><div><h4>Lighting Protection</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Since
critical facilities have a tendency to be very large, often remotely
located, they are clearly at higher than average risk for lightning
strikes. Lightning protection comes in many forms and is simply a
safeguard to Critical Operations from lightning strikes. It can be as
simple as a<b> single tower</b> located away from the main facility, or a <b>series of small lightning rods</b> (similar to those found in residential applications) connected to a ground conductor. <br>TVSS
setups are also a form of lightning protection to handle the immense
voltages associated with a strike. For Critical Operations installations
that may share utility connections with non-critical spaces or other
customers (namely, not having their own substation and switchgear with a
full set of other protective trips, relays, and interlocks), TVSS
should be an important part of the design in regard to lightning
protection, as the Critical Operations installation may not have full
control of the incoming utility.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_043.png" alt="Fig. 3.17 - A worker performs maintenance on a lighting protection device on an electrical transmission tower."><div> Fig. 3.17 - A worker performs maintenance on a lighting pro</div></div></span>

in mind that electrical energy does not exist as a stationary point in a
system but is always moving in some direction (ignoring energy storage
devices for the moment), <b>a zone selective interlock is an intelligent control feature</b> that can be added to a protective system in order to prevent the entire system from responding to a fault.<br>&nbsp;<br>For
example, a ground fault may be sensed on an entire circuit, from the
output of a UPS down to a specific piece of equipment; however, the
logic-controlled zone selective interlocks will observe the condition
and only perform the protective response at the point closest to the
fault (furthest downstream, in most cases). This will ideally only trip
the breakers nearest the condition—it wouldn't make sense to shut down
the entire electrical lineup if only a single PDU has a fault.&nbsp;<br>This
particular protection scheme could be designed in a very complex manner
depending upon the scale of the critical power distribution system and
criticality of connected load, but the underlying principle remains the
same: impact the least amount of equipment possible.&nbsp;</div></span></div></div>

thresholds or tighter tolerances than those upstream. Similar to
selective interlock functions, this allows for isolation of faults
closest to the condition, affecting fewer adjacent components.&nbsp;<br><b>Coordination studies should be performed during construction</b>,
but are unfortunately not regularly updated with the addition of new
equipment. Many Critical Operations, therefore, prefer periodic reviews
of the power distribution systems to identify any changes and then
adjust settings appropriately.</div></span></div></div>
<span><div><h4>Exercising Generators</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:48%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Exercising generators<b> refers to a variety of maintenance activities</b>
from short weekly run starts, to load bank tests, to full transfer of
connected critical load. It is general best practice to exercise
generators to at least a nominal extent on a monthly basis.&nbsp;<br>This is a hotly debated topic amongst Critical Operations personnel as <b>there is always some risk</b>.
An engine could break during an otherwise innocuous test and
inadvertently take a backup power supply away from the facility, or the
switchgear could hang up during a full load transfer and force the UPSs
to carry the load or cause an outage altogether. With proper
equipment-level maintenance, these risks can be minimized, but never
prevented. The other side of the argument is: if there is going to be a
failure, why not have it during a controlled environment, with competent
personnel around, and primary power sources still available?&nbsp;</div></span>
<span><div><h4>The main points from this module are as follows:</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>Power distribution</b>
is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a
primary source—either externally from the utility or internally from
generators—and then divide it up, pass it through any protective
features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load.</li><li>A <b>power distribution unit (PDU) </b>is
a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs—
typically in the form of outlets—designed to distribute electrical power
to multiple devices.<br></li><li><b>Redundancy </b>refers to the
inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not
be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function
to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment
failure.&nbsp;<br></li><li>A <b>closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) </b>utilizes
switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be
connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase
relationship between each source of power.<br></li><li><b>Soft loading </b>is
a method of switching between two power sources where a soft loading
transfer switch synchronizes and parallels the two independent power
sources without the interruption of power, and then transfers the load
between the two as it minimizes the momentary variations in the voltage
and frequency.<br></li><li>A <b>static transfer switch (STS)</b>
utilizes solid state power electronics and silicone controlled
rectifiers to transfer power very rapidly without utilizing slower
electromechanical means to transfer the power supply.<br></li><li>A <b>soft loading closed transition switch</b> is often utilized to support an automatic transfer of power while enabling a</li></ul></div></span>
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li><b>An automatic transfer switch (ATS) </b>automatically
transfers electrical power from the primary source (via
electromechanical means) to an alternate source such as an emergency
generator set.</li><li>An <b>interlock </b>is a device or controls
function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or
the system by stopping during a power outage.<br></li><li><b>Trapped Key Interlock </b>a key is actually trapped inside a cylinder that is part of the breaker itself.<br></li><li><b>Over-current protection </b>is
likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with:
it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe
levels.<br></li><li><b>Protective relays</b> are electromagnetically or
electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive
logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions.<br></li><li><b>Switchgear maintenance</b>
involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup,
exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database
maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular
equipment installed.<br></li><li><b>Breaker testing </b>involves physically inspecting a circuit breaker and subjecting it to as many functional checks as possible.<br></li><li><b>Breaker coordination studies refer</b>
to the analysis of installed breakers, their connected loads, and
validating or setting their protective features to operate in proper
sequencing.<br></li><li><b>Exercising generators </b>refers to a variety
of maintenance activities from short weekly run starts, to load bank
tests, to full transfer of connected critical load.</li></ul></div></span>

are an integral part of modern industry, making work easier for human
operators. However, these machines also pose a significant risk to
workers if not properly safeguarded. The fast-moving parts, sharp edges,
and high-powered mechanisms of machines can cause severe injuries like
amputations, lacerations, crushing, abrasions, and even fatalities. This
is why machine safeguarding is so important - it ensures that workers
can do their jobs safely and helps prevent costly accidents and
downtime. To understand how to safeguard machines, let's first
understand what exactly machines are and the hazards they can present.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><span><span><span role="button" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-expansion-panel-header-0" aria-controls="cdk-accordion-child-0" aria-expanded="true" aria-disabled="false"><span><span><b>What is a machine or machinery?</b></span></span></span><div role="region" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-cdk-accordion-child-0" aria-labelledby="mat-expansion-panel-header-0"><div><div><div><br>As per ISO 12100, an international standard on machinery safety, a machine is defined as "<i>An assembly fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system consisting of linked parts or components,<b> at least one of which moves</b> and which are joined together for a specific application.</i>"&nbsp;<br>This

ensure the safe operation of machines, it is necessary to control the
risks posed by machinery hazards. Controlling the risks involves
identifying the hazards, assessing the risk level presented by each
hazard, and implementing suitable control measures.&nbsp;This approach can be
implemented at any stage of the machinery's lifespan, from construction
to disposal, and should be repeated until the risk is deemed
acceptable.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_007.png" alt=""></div></span></div></div>
<span><div><h4>Hazard Identification</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Machinery
hazards that have not been identified can neither be assessed nor
managed. The risk control process, therefore, starts with an inspection
of the machine operation and its operating parts to identify the
hazards present.&nbsp; This includes checking for all hazardous conditions
and predicting any hazardous events associated with the machine. Using a
checklist or template can simplify the process, but hazard
identification can effectively be accomplished by following these four
steps.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><span><span><div><div role="tablist"><div><div role="tab" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-tab-label-0-0" aria-controls="mat-tab-content-0-0" aria-selected="true" aria-disabled="false"><div><span><b>Analysis of operation</b><br></span></div></div><div role="tab" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-tab-label-0-1" aria-controls="mat-tab-content-0-1" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false"><div><span><b>Analysis of machine</b></span></div></div><div role="tab" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-tab-label-0-2" aria-controls="mat-tab-content-0-2" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false"><div><span><b>Analysis of current controls</b></span></div></div><div role="tab" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-tab-label-0-3" aria-controls="mat-tab-content-0-3" aria-selected="false" aria-disabled="false"><div><span><b>Machine intervention analysis</b></span></div></div></div></div></div></span><div><span role="tabpanel" id="m_-3755247510017186302m_-5946566104972973135m_-6225435427042758663m_5120260444377618642m_7957634357067137552m_-4033507501790110064m_1009868339058130930m_4673920013252776594m_-4880736335190929717m_-989763194382644648m_-8673989543808816656m_-4386561211431299390m_8275290560287511832m_5039318172376817034gmail-mat-tab-content-0-0" aria-labelledby="mat-tab-label-0-0"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/ADKq_Na0U7LivmXX4enSsVFwAbCSq8TTkF7UlZl11u8hp_6f9md5VGLpx1pqD_d6"><div>This

<span><div><h4>General Considerations</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">In
all cases, the presence sensing devices should have a suitable maximum
response time that has been tested and is not affected by environmental
conditions. Their placement should consider a person's approach speed
and the total response time to shut down the machine. This can make
using presence-sensing devices challenging on some machines. However,
when using these devices (e.g., pressure mats, area scanning devices)
solely for hazardous start-up prevention, stopping time is not a

some cases, it may be necessary to perform maintenance or repairs on a
machine while the guarding interlocks are disabled. These kinds of
interventions are extremely risky and should be avoided if at all
possible. Additional control measures, usually involving the use of<b> protective devices</b>,
are required if the suspension of interlocks cannot be avoided.
Protective devices allow machine parts to move but in a way that reduces
the risk to the machine operator. Also, protective devices can offer
some degree of protection if a machine is difficult to guard due to its
operational requirements.

<span><div><h4>Redox Reactions</h4></div></span><span style="max-width:55%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Redox reactions are oxidation-reduction reactions in which electrons transfer between reactants.<br>During redox reactions, one of the reactants oxidises (it loses electrons), and the other is reduced (it gains electrons).<br>Another,
more specific definition of redox reactions involves the transfer of
oxygen and hydrogen between chemical species. The following are some
examples of redox reactions:</div></span><span style="max-width:36%"><div><img src="Gmail%20-%20Re_%20Complete%20your%20Alison%20purchase%20with%20these%20Bank%20Transfer%20details,%20tshingombe_files/unnamed_167.jpg" alt="Iron rusts, forming iron oxides."><div> Iron rusts, forming iron oxides. </div></div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ul><li>Metal corrosion (iron rust) is caused by oxygen in water, oxidising iron into oxides.</li><li>Combustion reactions: The combustion reactions are redox reactions in which hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water.</li><li>Respiration: Redox reactions convert the food we consume into energy.</li><li>Photosynthesis:

greater than the mentioned value, the reaction is too slow to be
considered feasible.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left">Consider the following example of the reaction between the two half cells, 2H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>/Zn.<br>&nbsp;

standard conditions can prevent the reaction from occurring. <br>In industry, the rate of a reaction is more crucial than E<sup>ϴ</sup>

don't have the right or sufficient equipment.&nbsp;It is advised to avoid
attempting to put out the fire if you don't have the appropriate
extinguisher or one that is large enough.<br> <br>Smoke that is harmful
may be inhaled. In addition to carbon monoxide, synthetic materials
that burn include nylon in carpets and foam padding in furniture. These
materials can also release ammonia, acrolein, and hydrogen cyanide.&nbsp;Very
modest concentrations of these gases can be lethal.<br> <br>Your gut
is telling you to stay away. Just let the firefighting squad do their
work if you are uneasy about the scenario for whatever reason.

<b>azard versus Risk - 1</b><br><br>Chemicals held in containers are
hazardous but there is very little risk while they are stored safely.
If, however, you take the chemical off the shelf and pour it into
another container, there is a risk of harmful vapour. If you spill the
chemical on the floor, the risk increases.<br><b>Hazard versus Risk -2</b><br>Flour
would not be considered by many to be a hazardous substance. If,
however, a baker IS exposed to flour dust over a period of time, either
airborne or by skin contact, there is a risk that the baker could
develop an inflammation of the skin, nose, or even asthma. There is also
the risk of injury through manual handling of the large bags of flour,
or burns from the hot ovens.<br><b>Hazard versus Risk -3</b><br><br>Now
consider electricity as a hazard.&nbsp;One risk is the likelihood that a
worker might be electrocuted because of exposure to electrical wires
that are inadequately insulated.

of Prevention, set out in the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act
2005.&nbsp;<br><br>Nine Principles of Prevention:</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><ol><li>&nbsp;<b>Avoidance</b>:&nbsp;The avoidance of risks or removing the risk altogether.</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Evaluation</b>:&nbsp; The evaluation of unavoidable risks. Calculate the level of those risks that cannot be avoided.</li><li><b>Combating</b>:&nbsp;The combating of risks at source, taking immediate action where possible.</li><li><b>Adaptation of work</b>:&nbsp;The
adaptation of work to the individual, especially with regard to the
design of places of work, and the choice of work equipment.</li><li><b>Adaptation of place</b>:&nbsp;The adaptation of the place of work to technical progress.</li><li><b>Replacement</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of dangerous articles, substances, systems of work by safe or less dangerous alternatives.</li><li><b>Giving of priority</b>:&nbsp;The
giving of priority to collective protective measures over individual
protective measures - look after everyone and not just the individual.</li><li><b>Development of policy</b>:&nbsp;The development of an adequate prevention policy in relation to this type of risk.

must apply the principles of prevention to avoid hazards. Where hazards
cannot be avoided, employers must assess the risk and reduce it by
using measures that protect all workers or by using safer work
procedures.<br>Where hazards cannot be avoided or reduced, employers
have a duty to put in place appropriate measures for the protection of
workers such as training and signage.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Avoidance</b><br>The
first option you must consider when dealing with risk is to avoid the
hazard completely, and so eliminate the risk altogether.&nbsp;If you can, you
remove the dangerous item, or rearrange things so that the hazard no
longer exists.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Evaluation</b><br>When
you cannot remove risk, you must evaluate the risk that you can't
avoid. This allows you to analyse the situation and helps you to come up
with solutions.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Risk Reduction</b><br>After
evaluation, you act to reduce the level of risk. This might mean, for
example, making sure that there is somebody holding the bottom of a
ladder, when in use.
<span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Training</b><br>If
you cannot eliminate or reduce the risk sufficiently, training should
also be introduced on safe practice. First Aid and manual handling
training are two areas of training often required in schools.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>Protective Equipment</b><br>Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) should be the final option considered, and
be implemented alongside training.&nbsp;When there are no adequate means to
eliminate the risks involved in a task, you need to ensure that the
staff member or student wears suitable personal protective
equipment.&nbsp;Employees are obliged to wear PPE when instructed to do so by
their employer.</div></span><span style="max-width:100%"><div style="font-size:14px;text-align:left"><b>“Students Circulating in Numbers”</b><br>Students
create additional risk as they circulate in numbers about the school.
You can reduce collisions and the consequent risk of injury by managing
that circulation.<br>‘Keep-left’ or ‘one-way’ systems can be effective, especially on stairs and in narrow corridors
