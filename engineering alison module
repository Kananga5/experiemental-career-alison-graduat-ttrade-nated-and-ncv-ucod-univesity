    Lesson Summary
        Recording involves capturing sound waves and converting them into digital or analog formats for playback. This process requires careful planning, from selecting the right equipment to optimizing the recording environment.
        The recording environment plays a significant role in the quality of the captured sound. Acoustic treatments like foam panels, bass traps, and diffusers minimize unwanted reflections and ensure clarity.
        After initial recording, the focus shifts to editing, where engineers refine audio to achieve a polished result. Editing involves tasks like cutting, comping, noise reduction, and aligning performances to a timing grid.
        One critical step is comping, which involves selecting the best sections from multiple takes and combining them into a seamless performance. This technique is especially useful for vocals and intricate instrumental recordings.
        Mixing is the process of balancing and blending individual audio tracks to create a cohesive piece of music or sound. Engineers adjust levels, panning, equalization, and effects to shape the sonic landscape.Level balancing ensures that each element in a mix is appropriately audible. Engineers carefully control the volume of instruments and vocals to maintain clarity while emphasizing key elements.
        Lesson Summary
            Sound is the vibration of air molecules that creates pressure waves perceptible to the human ear. It has essential properties like frequency, which determines pitch, and amplitude, which governs loudness. Understanding these principles is fundamental to sound engineering, a field focused on capturing, manipulating, and reproducing sound effectively.
            Sound engineering involves both scientific and creative processes. Engineers use their technical expertise to design and operate recording equipment while employing artistic judgment to shape the sound’s aesthetic. This dual role requires a strong understanding of acoustics, physics, and the psychological impact of sound.
            Signal flow refers to the path audio signals take from their source to the output. It begins at the sound source, such as a voice or instrument, and moves through various stages, including microphones, preamplifiers, and processors, before reaching speakers or headphones.
            The first stage in signal flow involves capturing the audio signal. Microphones convert sound waves into electrical signals, with different types suited for specific applications. For example, dynamic microphones are durable and ideal for live settings, while condenser microphones capture subtle details in studio environments.
            Electroacoustic devices are tools that convert sound energy into electrical energy or vice versa. They are essential in sound engineering for capturing, manipulating, and reproducing audio. Examples include microphones, speakers, and headphones.
            Microphones are the primary electroacoustic devices used for capturing sound. Dynamic microphones operate using electromagnetic induction, making them durable and suitable for high-pressure sound environments. Condenser microphones, on the other hand, use capacitors and require phantom power, offering high sensitivity and detail.

        Introduction
        The word 'Engineering" originated from the Latin root ingeniere, which means to design or to devise. The Latin root "in generate" means "to create". Engineers are individuals who design industrial products by combining the knowledge of science, mathematics, and economics and develop the technology for outputting a product to solve problems that are beneficial to society. 
        Mechanical engineers are involved in the research, development, design, manufacturing, and testing the tools, engines, machines, and other mechanical devices. 
        In this topic, you will learn briefly about what mechanical engineering is all about.
        What is Engineering?
        To put it in a simple way, engineers are involved in developing new and better technologies using their knowledge of mathematics, science, and materials. 
        However, they are not solely restricted to the development of new technology but also to communication and skills.
        What is Engineering?
        Many students start studying mechanical engineering due to their interest in mathematics and science. Others because they are interested in technology. 
        However, whatever an individual interest may be, by the end of the day, the objective of an engineer is to build a device that can do a task accurately, quickly, and safely. Before any metal is cut or hardware is manufactured, an engineer can refine ideas on paper and with computer simulations, saving time and money by testing fewer mock-ups.
        What is Mechanics?
        The branch of natural science that deals with the state of motion and the state of the rest of the masses under the action of force is mechanics. Mechanics has been at the centre of interest of many philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists for many centuries. 
        The mechanics developed by the scientists can be classified into the following classes:
            Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Mechanics.
            Relativistic Mechanics.
            Quantum Mechanics.
        What is Mechanics?
        Sir Isaac Newton combined the philosophy and experimental observations involving the state of matter in the states of rest and motion and deducted the three laws of motion and the law of gravitation. Classical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics is based on these laws.
        Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
        When the length scale goes down to the atomic length scale, certain phenomena can not be explained with
        Newtonian mechanics. The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviors of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Qu
        Laws of Mechanics
        In this section, we will discuss the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics. First, we will discuss Newton's three laws of motion, and then we will discuss the gravitational law of Newton.
        Newton's First Law of Motion
        Newton's Second Law of Motion
        Newton's Third Law of Motion
        Newton's Law of Gravitation
        calars and Vectors
        In engineering mechanics, scalars or vectors are used to measure all physical quantities.
            Scalar: Any physical quantity, either positive or negative, that can be completely described by its magnitude is a scalar. Scalar quantities include things like length, mass, and time.
            Vector: Any physical quantity that needs both a magnitude and a direction to be fully described is referred to as a vector. Velocity, force, and moment are a few statics-related examples of vectors. Typically, an arrow is used for the visual representation of a vector.
            The magnitude of the vector: the length of the arrow.
            The vector's line of action: the angle between the line and a fixed axis.
            The vector's sense of direction: the arrow's head or tip corresponds to.
            The vector quantities are represented by:
            In print: by bold letters, e.g., A.
            In handwriting: by drawing an arrow on top of it.
        Statement: Every object continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled by an external agency acting on it
        Newton's first law of motion has defined force as an external agency that influences the state of motion or the rest of an object.
        A body in rest or in motion will remain in its position with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.
        Vector Operations
        In this section, we will discuss different vector operations that are essential for engineering problems.
        Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
        A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
        Vector Addition Operations
        The vector addition of different vector quantities obeys the parallelogram law of addition. The vector addition operation of two vectors A and B is illustrated in Fig. 2 and done by the following procedure:
        1. Connect the component vectors A and 8 1 s tails together at a point to make them concurrent.
        2. Draw a line parallel to A from the head of B. Similarly, draw another line parallel to B from the head of A. The neighbouring sides of a parallelogram are formed by the intersection of these two lines at point P (Figure: 2).
        3. The diagonal R of this parallelogram that extends to P is the resultant of the vector R = A + B.
        Equilibrium of a Particle
        Condition for the Equilibrium of a particle
        If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
        The word "equilibrium," or more specifically "static equilibrium," is most frequently used to refer to an item that is at rest. The resulting force acting on a particle must be equal to zero in order to satisfy Newton's first equation of motion and preserve Equilibrium. This circumstance can be represented numerically as:-
        The above equation represents the vector sum of all the forces acting on the particle. This equation is the sufficient condition for Equilibrium. 
        Basic Terminology in Thermodynamics
        Before we move into the world of thermodynamics, we should first discuss the macroscopic and microscopic points of view along with some basic terminology.
        Boundary
        A boundary is a closed surface that separates a constrained space or a finite amount of substance from its surroundings
        System
        Surroundings
        An Open System
        A Closed System
        The Macroscopic Point of View
        The Microscopic Point of View
        ntroduction
        Fluid mechanics is the study of all fluids in static and dynamic conditions. Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium. This topic will introduce you to the physical concepts that underpin fluid mechanics.
        Fluid Mechanics
        The main difference between a fluid and a solid is that a solid deforms only a finite amount due to applied shear stress until the elastic limit. 
        On the other hand, the fluid continuously deforms as long as the shear stress is applied.
        Both gases and liquids fall under the term "fluid". We will use the term "fluid" to apply to either a gas or liquid.
        Lesson Summary
            Mechanical engineering is a discipline that studies the properties of forces, materials, energy, fluids, and motion, as well as how to use those features to create products that progress the society and enhance people's lives.
            The development and commercialisation of the vehicle were considered to be the profession's greatest accomplishment of the 20th century.
            Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
            The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviours of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Quantum mechanics was laid by Schrodinger (1887—1961) and de Broglie (1892-1965).
            According to Newton's second law of motion, the force acting on an object is proportional to the time rate of change of momentum. Newton's third law is the law of action and reaction.
            A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
            If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
            ouple is defined as two parallel forces that have the same magnitude, but opposite directions and are separated by a perpendicular distance d. A moment of a couple is the moment produced by a couple.
            Thermal equilibrium is the state that two (or more) systems reach after being in communication with one another through a diathermic wall and is defined by constrained values of the systems' coordinates.
            A process is referred to as adiabatic if there is no heat transfer occurring. The word adiabatic originates from the Greek term adiabatos, which means not to be transmitted. A process can be adiabatic in one of two ways:
            According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may only change forms during a process; it cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, during a procedure, every amount of energy should be taken into account.
            A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between any two points is independent of the path taken by the particle.
            Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium. 
            The mechanics of the rigid body involves the dynamic and static behaviour under external forces acting on obje

            Lesson Summary
                Machines are beneficial by changing the amount of force or the speed of action. A simple example of a machine can be a claw hammer. 
                Friction is the resistance that one surface offers to another surface as it moves across it. The nature of the two surfaces and the forces holding them together affect how much friction there is.
                A bearing is a support and guide that shuttles one or more moving machine components. It keeps the immobile part and any moving pieces in their normal position.
                A mechanism that can mechanically add and subtract is a gear differential. To be more precise, we should say that it adds the total revolutions of two shafts.
                Any mechanism that connects two parts is referred to as a coupling. Shaft couplings come in a variety of designs, and they can be used to join line shafts that are made up of multiple shafts of various lengths.
                To avoid vibration problems, minimise excitation forces via balancing or mass balancing, and avoid force propagation by isolating or absorbing vibrations.
                The mechanical design creates mechanical parts, components, products, or systems. The mechanical design includes creating numerous machine elements such as shafts, bearings, clutches, gears, and fasteners.
                Hydraulic machines and tools use liquid fluid power to do simple tasks. Heavy machinery is a typical example. Hydraulic fluid is carried throughout the machine to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders, where it becomes pressurised based on the resistance present.
                Lesson Summary
                    One application of jet impact is the generation of energy. The effect of the jet is used to rotate the turbine, namely the Pelton wheel in the generator: The force applied by the water jet is tangential to the wheel.
                    A hydraulic turbine is a machine that converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. The hydraulic turbines are also known as water turbines. The hydraulic turbine can be categorised into two.
                    In a reaction turbine, the total energy at the inlet of a turbine is kinetic energy and pressure energy. It is used for the low head of water. The Francis and Kaplan turbines are inward and axial flow reaction tur

                    Application of Solidification
                    The backbone of the real industrial environment is workshop practice, which helps develop and improve critical technical hand skills required by technicians working in various engineering sectors and workshops.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    The gating system is the passageway that transports the molten metal into the mould chamber. A gating system comprises four parts: a pouring cup, a down gate or sprue, a runner, and an ingate.Parting line gates, bottom gates, horn gates, branch gates, and top gates are examples of gates. 
                    A riser (or feed head) is a hole in the cope. Its primary function is to feed molten metal into the casting as it solidifies, compensating for shrinkage. The risers also act as an enormous vent for generated steam and gases and a loose sand or slag collection point.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    Cores are sand bodies used to generate hollow parts or cavities of a desired shape and size in a casting. In addition to developing internal cavities in the casting, the cores perform the following functions:
                        The cores may be used to construct a complete mould.
                        The cores may be used to form a part of a green sand mould.
                        The cores strengthen or improve a mould surface.
                        The cores may be used as a part of the gating system.
                    Depending upon their position, the various cores are horizontal cores, vertical cores, balanced cores, drop cores, and cover cores or hanging cores.
                    Types of Casting Processes
                    Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set. This will raise the production cost. Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish.

                    Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish. The following casting procedures may be utilised to achieve these requirements:
                    Permanent Mould Casting
                    Slush Casting
                    Die Casting
                    Permanent mould casting is a casting created by gravity pouring molten metal into a mould composed of some metallic alloy or other substance of permanence. This technique of casting is also known as die casting.
            list-icon2
        Die Casting Machines
        Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine
        The melting pot is a vital feature of a hot chamber die casting machine. At pressures ranging from 7 to 14 MPa, molten metal is driven into the die cavity. The pressure can be generated using compressed air or a hydraulically powered plunger. Hot chamber die casting machines are used to make zinc, tin, lead, and other low melting alloys.
        Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine
        More Examples of Casting
        Centrifugal Casting
        Investment Casting
        Shell Moulding Process
        Centrifugal casting refers to pouring molten metal into a rotating mould and allowing it to harden. Centrifugal casting refers to the castings generated by this centrifugal force. This method is very useful for casting symmetrical pieces. This technique may cast both ferrous and n
        Defects in Casting
        Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal. The following are some of the flaws:
            Mould shift: It causes a mismatch between the top and bottom parts, typically at the parting line.
            Swell: It is a localised or overall enlargement of the casting caused by molten metal pressure enlargement of the mould chamber.
            Fins and flash: These are thin metal projections that are not designed to be cast. These typically appear at the mould's parting line.
            Sand wash: It commonly appears as rough bumps on the surface of casting near the ingates.
            Shrinkage in casting: It is a crack in the casting or dishing on the casting's surface caused by unequal contraction of the metal during solidification.
            Hot tear: It is a ragged internal or exterior discontinuity in a metal casting caused by inhibited contraction shortly after the metal has set.
            Sand blow or blowhole in casting: It is a dip on the outside surface of an exceptionally smooth casting.
            Honeycombing or slag holes in the casting: These are smooth depressions on the casting's upper surface. They are frequently seen around the ingates.
            Defects in Casting
                Scabs: These are sand patches on the casting's upper surface.
                Cold shuts and misruns: These arise when the mould cavity is not filled, resulting in a bad casting.
                Pour short: This casting flaw occurs when the mould cavity is not filled due to a lack of metal.
                Run-outs and bust-outs: These allow the metal to drain from the hollow, resulting in unfinished castings.
                Introduction
                Workshop technology is the branch of technology that deals with the many processes involved in manufacturing machine or equipment components. 

                This topic is intended to provide the learner with the information, abilities, and mindsets needed to accomplish fundamental workshop tasks.
                Electric Resistance Welding & Its Types
                Pressure Welding
                Controlling Current Quantity
                Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage (from 6 to 10 volts only), and high amperage (ranging from 60 to 4000 amperes) electr
        onferrous metals. This method yields castings with a dense and fine-grained structure.
        Electric Resistance Welding
        The following are the numerous forms of electric resistance welding:
        Spot welding
        Projection welding
        Butt welding
        It is used for welding lap joints and joining components composed of plate material ranging in thickness from 0.025 mm to 1.25 mm. The plates to be linked are sandwiched between two copper or copper alloy electrode points. It should be noted:
        • The electrode tip diameter.
        • The distance between the plate's nearest edge and the centre of the weld should be at least 1.5d.
        • The distance between two spot welds s
        rc Welding - Types & Processes
        Arc welding is a fusion welding procedure that generates heat by striking an electric arc between the work (or base metal) and on electrode. The heat produced by the electric arc has a temperature range of 6O00°C to 7OOO•C. 
        Arc welding can be done with direct current (D.C.) and alternating current (A.C.): however, direct current is recommended for most applications.
        The welding set-up is considered to have straight polarity when the work is connected to the positive terminal of a D.C. welding machine and the negative terminal to an electrode holder. When the work is connected to the negative terminal and the electrode to the positive terminal, the welding set-up is said to have reversed polarity. 

        Straight polarity is preferred for some welds, whereas reversed polarity is preferred for others. Depending on the type of electrode, there are two forms of arc welding:
            Un-shielded arc welding: Un-shielded arc welding is when a large electrode or filler rod is utilised for welding.
            Shielded arc welding: Shielded arc welding is performed when welding rods covered with fluxing material are employed.
        hould not be less than 3d, and it should be equal to I, where I is the thickness of the plate to be welded.
        as Welding & Types of Flames
        It is a type of fusion welding in which heat is generated by the combustion of fuel gas. Oxygen and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals (C2H2). The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200° C. The following are the essential equipment necessary for oxy-acetylene gas welding:
        Welding Torch
        It is sometimes referred to as a blowpipe, a device for mixing the proper amounts of oxygen and acetylene and then burning the mixture at the end of a tip, producing a high-temperature flame. Welding torches are commercially available in two varieties:
        Injector Or Low-Pressure Type
        Positive Or Equal Pressure
        Injector or low-pressure type: The injector or low-pressure type welding torch runs at less than 7 kN/m2 acetylene pressure. The chemical reaction between water and calcium carbide produces this low-pressure acetylene at the welding site (CaC2). However, depending on the tip size, the oxygen is delivered at pressures ranging from 70 to 280 kN/m2.
        uipment Necessary For Oxy-Acetylene Gas Welding
        Welding Torch Tip
        The tips ore mode of materials with high thermal conductivity, such as copper or copper alloy. Each welding torch usually comes with interchangeable tips for different thicknesses.
        Pressure Regulators
        Hose And Hose Fittings
        Gas Cylinders
        Gas Welding Technique & Oxygen Cutting
        The usual gas welding techniques in oxy-acetylene welding are as follows:
        Leftword Or Forehand Welding
        The welding torch is held in the operator's right hand, with the tip pointed to the left, and the weld is mode from right to left. The torch forms a 6O• - 70° angle with the plate, while the welding rod forms a 30• - 40° angle. Welding plates thicker than 6mm are not cost-effective with this technology.
        Right-Word Or Back-Hand Welding
        Vertical Welding
        Linde Welding
        Measuring Instruments in Mechanical Engineering
        Mechanical engineering measuring instruments are dimensional control instruments used to determine the exact size of an object. These gadgets are adjustable and can measure with an accuracy of 0.001 mm or better. The gouges are not graded and have set dimensions. There is no changeable component for measuring different lengths and angles in most cases. Following is a brief discussion of several essential measuring devices and gouges:

        ntroduction
        While studying engineering, specifically mechanical and civil engineering, it is very important to know the basics of engineering drawing. Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item. In this topic, we will briefly introduce ourselves to the basics of engineering drawing.
        Drawing
        A drawing is a graphical presentation of an actual object, an idea, or a suggested design that will eventually be built. 
        Drawing can take many different shapes, but the graphic manner of representation is a fundamental, inherently natural way of conveying ideas that is ageless and universal.
        Types of Drawing
        There are mainly two types of drawing;
            Artistic Drawing.
            Technical or Engineering Drawing.
        The Definition of Engineering Drawing
        A graphical language that engineers and other technical members associated with the engineering profession use to thoroughly and precisely express the specifications for engineered objects are known as an engineering drawing. It is a representation of a three-dimensional item in two dimensions.
        In other words, engineering drawing is the process of accurately portraying a real or imagined object utilising some graphics, symbols, characters, and numbers with the aid of engineering drawing tools.
        Engineers and technologists use it. An engineering drawing contains all the details regarding the objectls size, shape, type of surface, materials, etc. For example, circuit diagrams for electrical and electronics engineers, building drawings for civil engineers, machine drawings for mechanical engineers, computer graphics for everyone, et
        Feeler Gauge
        Instruments for Drawing
        The most common instruments used for engineering drawing are:
            1. Drawing board (Approximately 20" x 20"), drafting table, or desk.
            T-square (24", transparent edge)
            Set of instruments
            450 triangle (8" side)
            300 x600 triangle (10" long side)
            Irregular curve
            Pencils (2B, FIB, 31-1)
            Protractor
            Eraser
            Dusting brush
            Drafting tape
            Circle and ellipse templates.
            ow to Read Drawings
            An engineer must be able to tell what an engineering drawing is portraying drawn by another engineer. This is known as reading a drawing. To read drawing, one must understand how engineers use lines, dimensions, and notes
            You can see that each line has special importance that you must comprehend to accurately interpret a drawing. Let's talk about some of the most significant types.
            Lines
                A visible line—also referred to as an object line, is used to indicate an item's edges that are visible to the viewer.
                Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
                Often, some lines are drawn on the exposed surfaces of a section drawing. These are section lines and are used to display various types of materials.
                Dimensions
                Engineers use lines to describe an object's form or shape, but they use dimensions to express its full size. There are two different kinds of dimensions used in drawings: size and location.
                A size dimension displays an object's or a fraction of an object's size, as suggested by their names, and a location dimension describes the placement of features. The adjacent figure displays examples of both size and
        Vernier Height Gauge
        Three Dimensional Drawing
        Isothermic Drawing
        An isometric drawing is the illustration of the object in the image. The term "pictorial drawings" refers to the family of three-dimensional perspectives. 
        The width and depth planes' horizontal lines in an isometric drawing are represented at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, while the object's vertical lines are drawn vertically. 
        The lines parallel to these three axes are drawn using these rules and are drawn at their true (scale) lengths. A line will not be its actual length if it is not parallel to these axes.
        "Assembly" Drawings
        Pillow-block Image
        The first image is an isometric view of a pillowblock bearing system that has been assembled. It closely matches what you see when looking at the thing from a specific angle. 
        From this angle, it is impossible to determine how the part looks on the inside
        We can also show isometric views of the pillow block being taken apart or disassembled in this next image.
        This allows you to see the inner components of the bearing system, Isometric drawings can show the overall arrangement clearly but not the details and dimensions
        Disassembled Pillow-block
        A cross-sectional view portrays a cut-away portion of the object and is another way to show hidden components in a device.
        Imagine a plane that cuts vertically through the centre of the pillow block, as shown in the figure above. 
        Then imagine removing the material from the front of this plane, as shown in the figure belo
        Correlations of Lengths and Diameters
        The correlations of lengths and diameters are better seen in this orthogonal cross-sectional view (section A-A, figure on the right). Compared to isometric drawings, these drawings are simpler to produce. It takes some time, but experienced engineers can read orthogonal designs without requiring an isometric drawing. 
        The top "outside" view of the bearing is shown in the figure on the right. It is an orthogonal (perpendicular) projection. Notice the direction of the arrows for the "A-A" cutting plane.
        Drawing Tools
        Both manual drafting tools (figure below) and computer-aided drafting or design, or CAD, can be used to create drawings. No matter what design tool you choose to make the drawings, the fundamental drawing standards and practices are the same. 
        We shall approach learning about drafting from the standpoint of manual drafting. A freehand sketch is a drawing that was created without the use of any tools or CAD software.
        Lesson Summary
            Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set.
            Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal.
            Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage, and high amperage.
            Oxygene and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals. The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200 degrees C.
            Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item.
             The most common instruments used for engineering drawing include; drawing board, protractor, eraser, drafting tape, T-square, irregular curve, etc.
            Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
            One of the issues of three-dimensional drawing is that it is often difficult or sometimes almost impossible to draw the interior details of the inside of an object.

        Learning Outcomes
        After completing this module, you will be able to:
            Explain slab centring, beam reinforcements, and beam arrangements in building technology
            Identify the positive and negative bending moments that act on beam reinforcements
            Describe the processes used in slab reinforcements
            Discuss the systems for staircase placement, shuttering and reinforcements
            Translate electrical drawings and electric conduit installation diagrams
            Lesson Summary
            The key points from this module are:


            Practical procedure for arranging of beam bottom and slab centring
            The slab centring plates, beam bottom and beam sides will be supported by using wooden or steel props. When a load is placed on the props, the load will be transferred uniformly to the slab.
            The process for placing the slab reinforcements include:
                First step – Shorter horizontal bars are laid first.      Second step – The distribution bars are laid next.
                Third step – involves adding the top extra bar           Fourth step – Mark the crank distance
                Fifth step – Once the crank distance has been marked, a distribution bar will be placed at the centre portion. The bars in the shorter direction would be laid below the bars placed in the longer direction.
            After placing the slab reinforcements, other activities to be carried out at the site include:
            1.   Creating the staircase riser and thread.                      2.   Placing of staircase shuttering and reinforcement

            3. Placing the electrical conduit on the slab                     4.     Placing of plumbing sleeves in sunken slab
            Lesson Summary
            5.   Complete casting of slab and staircase: A sunken slab level is cast lower than the main slab so that the plumbing lines/fittings can be laid inside the sunken slab. The entire length of the slab will be cast in one day.

            6.   Curing of slab at the construction site

            7.   Deshuttering of beam sides, beam bottom and slab centering – After three days of slab casting, the slab centering plates can be removed. The props will be put back in their original position after the slab centering plates are removed. Whereas, the beam bottom will take at least 7 days before removal. The props will also be put back in their original position after the beam bottom has been removed.
            Beam design (beam data and material grades for beam design)
            Single reinforced section – This refers to the practice where reinforcements are provided only at the tension region. The purpose of providing reinforcement here is to hold the stirrups.

            Double reinforced section – If the reinforcement is provided both at the compression and tension regions, it is called a double reinforced section. This reinforcement will take part in load carrying and support of stirrups.
            The bending moment of a beam: When the shear force is at maximum value, the bending moment will be zero. Whereas, where the bending moment is zero, the shear force will be at maximum value.
            Learning Outcomes
            After completing this module, you will be able to:
                Indicate the safety practice from the design and construction points of view
                Highlight the importance of the bill of quantities in structural engineering projects
                Discuss the importance and application of the general notes in structural drawings
                Lesson Summary
                The key points from this module are as follows:

                Safety from the construction point of view
                ●  For a structural engineer, safety comes before economy. While working at a site, safety is the first priority.

                ●  While working at heights, always wear safety belts.

                ●  The safety shoes, reflector, and helmet are a must for a structural engineer.

                ●  Carry out quality checks including worksite information and general housekeeping, personal protection, etc.
                Examples of safe work practice at the site are as follows:
                ●   Shielding the protruded ends of reinforcement at the site.                      ●   Proper zoning of materials at the site.
                ●   Safety nets to prevent accidents dues to falling.
                Outline the building construction process with practical demonstrations and examples
        Lesson Summary
        Safety from the design point of view will consider:
            The major failures of buildings occur due to construction failure and not a design failure.
            We consider enough factors of safety (FOS) for concrete and steel.
            We overestimate the load coming on the building and underestimate the strength of the material.

                                            Lesson Summary
                                            Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                Arrangement questions make use of factorials. A factorial is displayed as: 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24
                                                To find the expected value you can multiply the chance of a certain outcome against the outcome and add that all together.
                                                There are 3 separate definitions for calculating the probability of simple events. The classical definition (equal likelihood methods) is used when there is an equal probability of any item happening (rolling a die), the relative frequency definition is used when you have to experiment multiple times to calculate the probability and the subjective definition is used when you have to take a guess at the outcome (sports events or elections).
                                                When finding whether events are independent you can this of it as the probability of both events is equal to the probability of one events happening tims the other or P(CnB) = P(C) x P(B).
                                                A tree diagram is used to visually display all possible outcomes when calculating probability. Working backwards along a tree diagram is also known as Bayes’ Theorem.
                                                The sum of all possible probabilities must always equal a positive 1. To find the mean value of the experiment is to add up each possible outcome that is mul
                                                Lesson Summary
                                                Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                    Normal distributions are shown as symmetrical with the equally likely probability of events happening. Positive distributions are skewed to the left and negative distributions are skewed to the right. The probability of being within one standard deviation of the mean is 68%.
                                                    Binomial distributions always work with 2 possible outcomes. You can work with outcomes that are either dependent on the previous outcome or independent events.
                                                    When given the number of trials and a successful outcome in an exam question you can determine that you are being asked about binomial distribution, questions will rarely plainly say they are asking about binomials. In Microsoft Excel, you can use the built-in functions to calculate the probabilities and mean of binomial outcomes.
                                                    Cumulative frequency (CF) is used when you want to group things together, like lengths of cucumbers. CF is always found on the y-axis. When plotting the CF the line that you can draw to show the increase is referred to as the ogive curve. You can also use this graph to find the median (also known as the Q2), lower and upper quartiles. With this information, you can then create a box and whisker plot.
                                                    To find the mean of a data set find the sum through addition and divide that total by the number of values in that data set.
                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                    Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                        When finding the frequency of ranges from a histogram you use the frequency destiny, which will also be how to find the area of the shape on the graph.
                                                        In stratified sampling, you look at the population and split them into smaller groups to find the probability. Cluster samples are more like a random sample, here you select a group to sample within the entire population. A quota sample is similar to the cluster sample, but you also want to add a specific group to be tested.
                                                        Studying the relationship between 2 variables is known as correlation. Scatter diagrams can be used to visually inspect the relationship. There are both positive and negative correlations.
                                                        A more precise measure of correlation is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, which is usually represented by an ‘r’. In Microsoft Excel, you can calculate this coefficient using an inbuilt function.
                                                        Any straight line, also known as the line of best fit, has the formula y = ax + b (where a is the gradient of the line and b is the intercept). There should always be a point that is the average of the x data and one that is the average of the y data. Excel has built-in functions to find the equation of this line.
                                                tiplied by the possibility of each outcome.

        Outline the ways non-verbal communication influences relationships and career growth

    Lesson Summary
    The following are the key points covered in the module:

        Active listening entailed eye contact, summarizing key points, and assuming an open body position to gain the speaker's perspective. It also involves attention, a lack of distraction, and the reception of verbal and nonverbal messages.
        Active hearing has many benefits, such as learning new things, making connections, understanding, and bonding. To avoid interruption and personal experience, one must make a conscious effort, practice, and train one's focus.
        While informative hearing collects information for judgment, critical listening judges and analyzes information for judgment, appreciative listening is motivated by enjoyment and amusement, and sympathetic listening empathizes and identifies with the speaker's feelings.
        Nonverbal clues, such as body alignment and facial expressions, guide interactions. Being aware of these cues allows for more successful interactions.
        Hand gestures, voice tone, physical touch, posture, and eye contact are essential. Positive cues improve connection and empathy; negative ones might impede communication.
        Improving relational dynamics depends on a self-awareness of nonverbal communication. Learning these signals will enhance confidence and professional contacts.

        Lesson Summary
        The following are the key points covered in the module:
            Emotions can impede successful communication in various ways, including spoken, written, nonverbal, and visual, resulting in potential misinterpretations based on the receiver's perception of words and nonverbal clues.
            The delivery of messages depends on tone and inflexion. Good communication calls for authenticity.
            Detaching the ego helps one avoid "loaded" conversations assigning blame.
            "Unloaded" communication stresses sharing personal emotions free from accusations—that is, "I feel...".
            Unchecked emotions like insecurity and rage can compromise communication efficacy and clarity.
            Understanding how emotions affect ideas and behavior, building self-awareness, and applying self-reflective questions to clarify one's thoughts help one control emotions properly. Furthermore, stopping before significant talks and emphasizing controlling emotional triggers to reach the intended results are crucial.
            Good communication calls for verbal and nonverbal signals, including the conversational emotional tone.
            Understanding unclear or abrupt communication requires an awareness of underlying emotions.
            Giving time for emotions to calm enables more fruitful conversations.
        e shows warmth and captures an audience. Managing difficult circumstances requires awareness of others' nonverbal signals.

            AI is transforming cybersecurity by improving vulnerability identification through faster data processing and pattern recognition than traditional methods.
            Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves collecting and analyzing information on threats, understanding adversaries' tactics, and proactively mitigating risks to protect assets.
            At the heart of AI-driven cyber threat intelligence are machine learning models, categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
            Network security starts with understanding potential threats, which can be categorized as internal or external, deliberate or accidental.
            Network traffic analysis involves the monitoring and examination of network data to detect anomalies, threats, and inefficiencies.
            The evolving nature of cyber threats requires continuous updates to AI models, but the process is resource-intensive and crucial for detecting new attacks.
            AI's data processing ability raises privacy concerns, making careful data handling crucial to prevent misuse and protect individuals' rights.
            Theoretical approaches to ethical AI are fundamental in understanding how artificial intelligence systems can align with human values, norms, and ethical principles.

                Career Progression and Salary
                The career ladder for software engineers differs from company to company. Each level on this ladder is given a different name by the company. For example, a software engineer at Meta starts at E3 and climaxes at E9, while the lowest level in Google is L2 and their highest is L11.
                Level 2 - Internship and Apprenticeship
                When you get an internship, you'll be placed at this level. Many organizations also place their apprentices at this level. Apprentices are people who did not come into tech from the traditional route. They may have gone through a boot camp, learned by themselves, or moved through a path that does not involve a traditional education (a degree). They can also be people who transition into software engineering from a non-tech role. An apprentice would spend about 6 months to a year at L2 before moving to L3.
                An intern is expected to be someone willing to learn and take on assignments. He/she would be assigned a mentor to guide their learning for about 3 to 6 months. When you start as an intern, you should meet with your mentor almost every day for guidance. Don't be surprised if the work you are given is data entry or testing.

                Level 3 - Junior Software Engineer
                These are Junior engineers, usually fresh out of college, boot camp, or self-taught, who are looking for their first real-world experience in a full-time role. They are often required to learn at least one programming language, such as Java, PHP, or Cotlin, and understand the technologies and methodologies associated with that language. They work under the direction of a team lead. A junior engineer is often given small pieces of work that may have little significant impact on a software project - (feature level impact) and may be supervised through their work.

During the 3-6 months you'll work as an intern, the company will evaluate you as though you were a new level 3 enginndustry, build your skills in a practical environment, develop work ethics, and learn when and how to seek help
                Even with this difference in the numbering of each level, the responsibilities they carry and the requirements for promotion are the same. Most companies use a leveling structure similar to Google’s, so the career progression outlined in this topic is based on their model. The career progression discussed here is for individual contributors.

        For instance, they may be given a small feature to implement along with a description of how the feature works, the steps they should take to implement it as well as resources they'll need. As time progresses, perhaps in a year or two, your team would trust you more to build entire features on your own and would not hold your hand as much as when you were new. At this point, depending on the organization, you may need to focus on more than just the feature you're working on. You would consider the software architecture, monitoring the application, and how your code or feature fits with the goals of the project. Note that in this role you will mostly be writing code. If you work in a bigger company, you should expect more handholding and large amounts of resources for any project or task. On the othe

        Introduction
        Many of us can write functional code. We may have learned to do so at a boot camp, taught ourselves, or spent 4 years in university jumping from one project to another. But simply writing code doesn’t make someone a professional software developer—if it did, that would be too easy! So, what separates a hobbyist programmer from a professional one? Software engineering. Anyone can become a software engineer(SWE). Many shy away from this role, “saying it's too complex,” yet others jump into it all the same. Whether you've been in the tech industry or just came in, we developed this course to successfully prepare you for this role.
        As you examine this topic, try to understand:

    What is Software Engineering?
    To the outside world, software engineering seems like a job of just writing code after code and nothing more. In fact, some people even enter this career thinking that's all they'll do—write code. We have Hollywood, of course, to thank for this common misconception. If you have worked in any tech role, you'll notice that your function and responsibilities are not limited to one task, and software engineering is no different. Writing code is just one aspect of it.
    Software engineering is a process used to develop, design, test, and maintain software using standardized methodologies and processes to make sure it meets client goals and requirements. You can think of it as a process to build software systems from scratch to finish. This process, in itself, is ‘Software Engineering’
    Software Engineering Principles - 1
    Modularity
    Professional software engineers build and manage large software systems. To make them easy to scale and manage, they use a principle called ‘modularity.’ Modularity is the practice of breaking down software into smaller parts that can be scaled and maintained independently. This allows engineers to work on one part of the software without affecting the rest.

    Software Engineering Career Paths
    Software engineers are also qualified to work in various other roles in the tech industry. This is as a result of their diverse skill sets. There are multiple career paths you can choose to follow. The exact job opportunities available to a software engineer can vary. They depend on factors like location, area of specialization, and individual skill set. Note that you would not need to stay forever in the role you chose from the onset of your career. For example, if you choose to start out as a front-end engineer, you may decide to switch to the backend. The point to note is that you are not required to spend your whole work life on one career path in software engineering.
    Types of Software Engineers - 1
    Frontend Engineer
    A front end engineer builds and optimizes the user interface (UI) of applications. This means front-end engineers develop and maintain the part of software that users see and interact with, which is often called the ‘client side’ of software. For instance, in the case of YouTube, the interface is the part you see and interact with. (e.g., the subscribe and like button) are designed, positioned, and built by front-end engineers.

    A data engineer works on software systems that acquire and use large volumes of data. They build and manage the systems (often called data pipelines) that collect, store and analyze large volumes of data. They make sure that these systems that move data from one place to another within the software are efficient, reliable, and scalable. This allows them to prepare the data for analysis which would enable organizations to make informed high level business decisions.

        Daily Responsibilities of SWEs - 1
        Throughout the software development life cycle, software engineers work on various tasks. The main responsibility of a software engineer is to develop software systems that fulfill client needs and meet business requirements. Oftentimes, the software is complex, so this responsibility is usually divided among teams. The daily responsibilities of software engineers would depend on the team they are deployed in, the project and the organization they work for. But oftentimes, these responsibilities include the following:
        Writing and Testing Code
        Software engineers spend a reasonable part of their day testing code. This involves writing code, improving code quality, fixing issues like bugs, and implementing new features.
        Code Reviews

        Introduction
        In this topic, we’ll consider the professional qualifications and skills you need to become a capable software engineer. It’s important to note that while not all the skills we discuss will be relevant to every software engineering role, they apply to most roles and will make you a more versatile engineer if you develop them. As you examine this topic, try to answer this question for yourself: What technical and interpersonal skills are necessary to become a software enginee
        Your Skills
        As we considered in the previous topic, a software engineer can qualify to work in a plethora of tech positions. Their skill set is what makes this versatility possible. So, what are these skills? There are two layers of skills to note here:
            The skills necessary for the particular subset of software engineering you choose to work in.
            These are the general skills every software engineer must possess.
        For example, a machine learning engineer must have a deep understanding of data science and be proficient in mathematical concepts related to data science. These same skills may not be as important for a front-end engineer whose f
        ard Skills - 1
        Hard skills are technical skills that are learned through education, training, or hands-on experience. They can be measured for proficiency and competency. These skills are necessary for performing the specific tasks required in your role and can be demonstrated through tests and certifications. For a software engineer, the essential hard skills include the following:
        Programming Languages
        Learning how to code is likely the first technical skill that comes to mind—it’s the bedrock of software engineering.
        This skill is critical because it enables you to create software, make informed decisions, guide the technical aspects of projects in the right direction, lead code reviews, and mentor team members.
        You don’t need to master every language out there; being proficient in at least one is enough. The four most commonly used languages in software engineering are Python, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS (though technically not a programming language, it’s essential for presenting UI to users).
        Data Structures and Algorithms


        Version Control Basics (Git, GitHub/GitLab)
        Hard Skills - 2
        Database Knowledge (SQL, NoSQL)
        When building software, you'll often deal with unorganized data stored in databases.
        To properly manage this data, you'll need to understand how databases work—how to structure, retrieve, and store data efficiently. SQL is the most popular language for organizing such data, while NoSQL offers alternative approaches for unstructured data.
        Testing and Debugging



        Software Development Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Waterfall)

        Building Hard Skills
        So now you know these skills. How can you build them? One effective way to develop hard skills is by solving creative coding challenges. You can find such challenges on platforms like:
            Advent of Code
            Codewars
            LeetCode
            HackerRank
            Exercism
        Start practicing, and you’ll see yourself improving in no time!
        Soft Skills - 1
        Soft skills are behavioral and interpersonal skills that determine how you relate to people in your workplace. Unlike hard skills, they’re not easily measured and are largely influenced by your personality. These skills are necessary to build a safe, productive, and collaborative work environment. Here are the top soft skills every software engineer should develop:
        Problem-Solving
        Your ability to solve problems is essential in every aspect of software engineering. You'll find yourself face to face with problem after problem, both technical and non-technical, such as Deadlines, Customer requirements, Bugs, Broken code, and Miscommunication
        It is important to develop the skill to approach problems thoughtfully and curate the most appropriate solutions for each one. Problem-solving is so valuable that it’s often tested during job interviews and techn
        Soft Skills - 2
        Attention to Detail
        Software engineering requires precision. You'll need to pay attention to what you do from coding and testing to debugging and documenting—every detail matters.
        Paying attention to detail minimizes mistakes and ensures accuracy in your work. Remember that computers only understand you when you tell them precisely what to do.

        Certifications and Degrees
        The traditional way to become a software engineer is to get a degree. But today, many software engineers are self-taught. Regardless of the route you choose, you’ll need a way to demonstrate your skills to employers. Certifications and degrees serve as formal proof of your expertise. You can gain these certifications and qualifications through a number of ways. These include:
            Boot camps
            Apprenticeship programs
            Professional certification programs
            University degrees
        As you examine this topic, consider these questions:
            What certifications do I need to possess?
            Should I get a degree for this role?
            Will this role be a good fit for my personality and aspirations?
            Is a Degree Necessary?
            The short answer is No! But when you look deeper, you'll see that it depends on (1) Your location. (2) The company you want to work for. For example, some companies prefer people who have a bachelor's or master's over someone who is self-taught or went through a boot camp, but these are not the majority. Most companies, though, don’t really care about your educational background as much as your skills and practical experience—your ability to do the work. Before drafting your personal learning and certification path, it’s important to research the qualifications required by the company you aim to work for. The main purpose of a degree or certification is to verify your skills and qualifications. Understanding what’s valued by your target employers will guide your decisions. In the following pages, we’ll explore each of these routes in detail.
            chelor's Degree - 1
            An undergraduate degree is one of the most common routes to becoming a software engineer. Even though it’s not required by many organizations for entry-level positions, it can give you an edge over other candidates. Some employers require candidates to hold a bachelor’s degree for specific roles to demonstrate their ability, skills, and experience in building complex systems. For senior-level positions like Lead Engineer or Senior Developer, a bachelor’s degree is often a minimum requirement.
            Bachelor's Degree - 2
            For a career in software engineering, you can pursue a bachelor’s degree in any computing-related field, such as:
                Computer Science
                Software Engineering
                Mathematics
                Data Science or Data Analytics
                Computer Engineering
            This degree involves studying one or two subjects in great detail over four (4) years of full-time study. In software engineering, your coursework would include:
                Programming
                Networking
                Software architecture
                Mathematics
            A degree in software engineering would give you a deep understanding of b
            Master’s Degree
            A master’s degree can help advance your career in software engineering, but it’s not necessary. It can be used to:
                Progress to higher positions within an organization.
                Negotiate a higher salary.
                Simplify the hiring process when transitioning between organizations.
            However, it’s important to note that your skills and experience are the major players that will help you progress in this career, not your academic qualifications. Only a few organizations require a postgraduate degree, like a master’s, for higher-level positions. Ultimately, a master’s degree can give you some benefits, yet it’s not required.

        Level 5 - Senior Software Engineer
        If you spent anywhere from 3-7 years as a software engineer you most likely would be in this position. This is a terminal role, which means that your company would no longer expect you to keep climbing the career ladder unless you want to. You can spend the rest of your career at this level. Some individuals move over to a managerial position from here; either way, it's not a requirement. The work you do now would have a team-level impact. What does this mean?

Most people who have earned a degree go for internships, which they can use to transition into a full-time role later on. Other engineers who are self-taught or graduated from a boot camp may directly apply to an entry-level position or start freelancing to build their portfolios. Either way, there are a lot of strategies you can use to secure a role regardless of the position you are gunning for. From this topic till the end of this course, we'll discuss the following:

        Preparing for the Job Search - 1
        Many people would be eager to jump into the job market and start applying for jobs, but that won't get you the best results. First, you need to understand what you're getting into, so you need to research the job market. This will allow you to put yourself in your employer's shoes to know what companies are currently looking for and how to tailor your application to their needs. To do this, look at listings on job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and AngelList. Each job posting you see would normally have listed requirements for each applicant, e.g., years of experience, proficiency in a list of languages and technologies, certifications, or soft skills relevant to the role.

    Industries That Hire SWEs
    Where would you like to work, Google, Microsoft, Meta or Apple? These are the goto choice for many engineers. But there are alot of other industries and companies you can work for. Some of them are easier to get into than big tech.
    Tech Startups
    These guys are on the lookout for employees that can help the company achieve its goal. To that end, you'll rarely hear of a startup asking for your certifications and degrees. Rather, they are more interested in your ability to solve real-world problems with your technical and soft skills, whether you're self-taught or a degree holder. You can prove your worth to a startup by using projects in your portfolio. We'll discuss how to build a portfolio that's attractive to employers down the line.

    Your Resume
    A recruiter would spend about 7 seconds skimming through your resume. At that time, s/he would decide if it was worth paying more attention to or casting aside. Today, many recruiting organizations use software to decide whether or not a resume is worth looking at. This software often filters out 60% of resumes. So, it is important for your resume to stand out. We'll discuss how to structure and write each part of your resume to make yours stand out. Some general points to note are:

        First, make sure your structure flows. Don’t complicate things—keep it simple, neat, and consistent. No fancy fonts or colors; just black and white is enough. Stick to what matters and avoid distractions.
        Use numbers for accomplishments. They make things clear. Show how much you’ve done and improved. If you've boosted retention, say by how much. It's all about the action. If you increase something, give a percentage. Don't hide behind words; show results.
        For education and skills, don't get caught up in dates or proficiency levels. They don’t matter here. It’s about what you can do, not how long you’ve been doing it or how good you think you are.
        Keep it short, using action verbs. It should be no more than
        Professional Online Presence
        You'll need an online presence in this career, not just to land your first role but to place you in a position of authority in the field. It also allows other people to see your level of skill and dedication to your work. Today, many software engineers have secured tech positions simply by having an active online presence. So, how and where can you build one? We'll discuss three platforms. In addition to these platforms, you should join developer communities on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Slack. Members of these communities who share project progress and quality content consistently have been known to receive job offers.
        one page. Only include what adds value to the bigger picture.
        Professional Online Presence
        X (Formerly Twitter)
        First, create an account and follow the people you would like to hire. In your bio, make it transparent that you are on a journey to land your first job in the tech industry. Then, you can begin commenting on other people's tweets with encouragement and positivity. This would make people see you as really nice, and many would follow you because they want to see you succeed on your journey. 
        Once you’ve got some eyes on you, start making meaningful contributions and posts. Make threads about anything you Learn(make it clean and useful). 
        LinkedIn 

        Github
        Portfolio-Building
        Before you can get employed by a company, you'll need to prove that you can do the job. This goes beyond your certifications. You'll need to find a way to showcase your abilities in practice. A portfolio would help you do just that. So, to define it, a portfolio is a piece of document or material that showcases your work in practice. For software engineers, this is best done with a website.
        ortfolio Website
        Image by Freepik
        Image by Freepik
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates. You can develop a website that will link its visitors to projects you may have worked on or contributed to. It should also include projects hosted on your GitHub or anywhere else. Once your portfolio website is set up, you can also add projects that demonstrate your use of languages you're proficient in, internships, awards and certifications you may have received
        Keep it simple and let the content speak for itself.

    Projects on Your Portfolio - 1
    How do you get projects to put on your portfolio? Oftentimes, most engineers work on solo projects like a budget app, cooking app, student study aid, or similar software. But if you want to stand out, you should showcase paid projects you have worked on and successfully completed—projects that actually generated revenue. You can get projects like this through freelancing. This is where you offer your services for a fee to the public. When you work on a project for a client, you may add it to your list of projects along with the revenue it generated for the client in specified numbers. Spice it up by stating the challenges for each project, as well as your thought processes and methodologies for overcoming those challenges to achieve the desired result.
    Projects on Your Portfolio - 2
    As a suggestion, you can add these two projects to your portfolio:

        A website where you can log in to an account and do something with it, like upload a picture or video or send a message. Most companies have software that allows users to log in and do something on their account. Working on this kind of project would prepare you to work on software like this on a large scale.
        Another project to work on is using external APIs, such as incorporating Google Maps into a project or using web sockets for real-time messaging apps.

    Finding Job Opportunities
    When job hunting, most people would first hit listings on job boards. It can be a challenge to stand out from the thousands of daily applications on each post. If you decide to use this method, filter for the most recent posting before applying. However, there is a much better way to get job offers—real-life networking. This is where you meet people and talk with them face to face, not on the Internet. Online interactions cannot replace the magic of face-to-face conversations. In fact, most high-quality business contacts come from physical interactions with people.
    How to Network
    One way to network is through meetups. Apps like ‘meetup’ allow you to meet with other programmers in your locality, connect with them, and eat free pizza. There, you might meet someone who would help you down your career. Another popular way to network is to attend conferences. This is usually more expensive but can get you high-quality connections.
    Before attending an event, practice small talk and self introduction

    Email Outreach
    One very effective way to get a software engineering job is to directly contact an individual in the company you wish to work for. Preferably, the person you contact should have decision-making power. To do this, send a direct email letting them know you are interested in working with their organization or company.
    Here is how to structure your email: THE INTRO The first part of your email should break the ice and build some form of rapport with him/her. It should notify the receiver that you have done some research about their company and that the email would not be a waste of their time. To do this effectively, you'll need to find a way to personalize it to them and what they're working on. You can't achieve this without researching the company and individual.
    You could say: “Hey (Name), Absolutely love what you're doing with/on [project they're currently working on]. I checked you [the main technology, tool, or structure they're trying to ach
    Passing Technical Interviews (PTI)
    Below are some tips to pass software engineering technical interviews:

        It is normal to get anxious when you are given a question or challenge to solve. You can reduce your anxiety by focusing on the problem preserved in the question itself rather than whether you impress the interviewer or the stakes at hand.
        To help you calm down and process the question, read them aloud to the interviewer. Start with writing pseudo code. It'll help you break down the problem into something simpler.
        Take your time to understand the requirements, so you don't waste your time writing code you would have to change later. You could ask clarifying questions like: “am I allowed to use this library?”
        Think aloud and explain the reasoning behind your decisions throughout your process. If this is a challenge for you, practice self-talk while you code privately to be comfortable with it before the interview date.
        Everyone gets stuck somewhere while coding. The way you react to roadblocks determines whether you get an offer or not. You can do either of these two things: (1) You may ask the interviewer for clarification for uncertainty, e.g., I think I'm on the right track if I know that X will cause Y outcome, which is not desirable. How do I prevent that? (2) You can always skip an issue and come back to it later.
        DON'T CHEAT!
        Avoid language-specific magic and use modulo operations instead, as it is found in most languages. Smile and speak clearly and confidently. If acceptable in your region, a sprinkle of casualty can help loosen the tension.

    ieve], and I love the work you put int
    PTI Continuation - The Big O Notation
    Big O Notation is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its performance or resource use as the size of the input grows. During the your technical interview, it's a prompt to remind you that you might need to:
    Understand Time Complexity
    Be prepared to discuss how long your solution takes to run as the input size increases. For example:
    O(1) means constant time (very fast).
    O(n) means linear time (grows with the input size).
    O(n^2) means quadratic time (much slower for larger inputs).
    Understand Space Complexity
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 1
    Topics You'll Be Tested On
    If you're applying to companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (shortened as FAANG), you'll be confronted with problems around Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming. Certain regions will answer your questions on dynamic programming. Other types of companies, e.g., banks, might give your take-home tests or behavior-style coding interview questions. 
    It is important for you to research the interview process for your company of choice to get a better idea of what to expect. 
    Choice of Language
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 2
    Data Structures 
    There are a handful of data structures you should have a basic understanding of before the interview; these are Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Sets, Maps, Linked Lists, Trees (binary search trees), and Graphs. You should also learn the purpose of each of these structures, their common use cases, their time complexity using Big O notation, and all the different operations like adding and subtracting elements when you should and should not use them, their pros and cons, and how to implement them.

        The career ladder for software engineers is as follows: Level 2 - Internship and Apprenticeship, Level 3 - Junior Software Engineer, Level 4 - Software Engineer, Level 5 - Senior Software Engineer, Level 6 - Staff software engineer, Level 7 - Senior Staff Software Engineering, Level 8+ Principal Software Engineer, Level 9 Distinguished Software Engineer and level 10 Google Fellow
        The industries that hire software engineers include Gaming and Entertainment, Retail and E-commerce, the healthcare industry, financial institutions like banks, and Tech Startups.
        The structure of your resume should be as follows: The Header(this should have your name), Contact Details (email address (use a professional email if you have one), phone number, LinkedIn and GitHub.), Education, Experience (For your list of experiences you may use the ‘XYZ’ Google formatting: I used X to accomplish Y that had Z results.) Projects (Include their timeframe, the challenges you overcame, and the results they got). The last section on your resume should be about your technical skills.
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates.

                Summarize the steps for interpreting pathway analysis results.
                esson Summary
                    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the sequencing of entire genomes from single cells or from entire organisms. It has enabled us to identify and measure genetic variation, enabling us to better understand the genetic basis of diseases and other biological processes.
                    Pathway analysis is often used in conjunction with other bioinformatics techniques such as gene expression profiling, and metabolomics.
                    Network analysis and control theory uses mathematical models to study the behavior of networks. These models are used to identify and analyze network parameters, such as topology, traffic flow, and routing.
                    There are several types of machine learning used in bioinformatics, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with supervised learning being the most common type of machine learning used in bioinformatics.
                    Clinical bioinformatics is used to identify, measure, and compare clinical features in order to make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
                    Integrating clinical laboratory data into a healthcare system requires the implementation of an electronic health record (EHR). An EHR is a digital record of a patient’s health information that can be accessed by healthcare providers from any location.
                    Lesson Summary
                        Biomedical engineering is a multifaceted discipline bridging medicine, biology, and engineering, dedicated to enhancing healthcare and quality of life.
                        Ethical considerations such as patient consent and data security, are pivotal as engineers navigate advancements like genetic engineering and AI in healthcare.
                        The most significant challenge of sequence alignment and database searching is the sheer amount of data that must be compared. With millions of sequences that need to be compared and analyzed, the process can be time-consuming and computationally intensive.
                        Protein structure prediction is an important task in the field of bioinformatics. The ability to accurately predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is important for understanding protein function and for drug discovery.
                        Phylogenetic analysis is an important tool for understanding evolutionary relationships between species and for identifying their relatedness.
                        There are a variety of techniques available for analyzing gene expression. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the research question and the type of data needed

            INTRODUCTION
            DEFINITION
            As a care worker, there is a good chance that the majority of your clients will be in the 70 or older age bracket. Because of this, it is important that you have an understanding of the most common conditions that clients of this age experience.
            Research shows that when you reach 70 years or older, your chances of contracting Dementia increases significantly. 
            The purpose of this section is to introduce the person with Dementia and to set a context for caring for those who have Alzheimer's disease - a disease of the brain that forever changes a person's memory, behavior and ability to care for oneself.

            SYMPTOMS
            TREATABLE
            It is important that care workers are familiar with the symptoms of dementia, as an early diagnosis of the condition may decrease it’s severity over the longer term.
            The symptoms of dementia are outlined below:
             
            - Decline in memory, thinking and reasoning. 
            - Changes in personality, mood and behavior.
            - Difficulties in the ability to communicate, to recognize people and places and to engage in activities.
            - Forgetfulness - forgetting names and appointments.
            - Difficulties with once-familiar activities.
            - Impaired judgment.
            - Problems with spatial and temporal orientation.
            Types of Dementia
            ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
            Alzheimer’s is by far the most common type of dementia, attributed to  approximately 2/3 of cases. It was first identified 100 years ago.
            The onset of Alzheimer’s can be slow and subtle, followed by a gradual decline. Changes in short term memory are noticeable, i.e. memory of recent events. This is typically the primary first complaint.

            Those at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer’s include:
            The Elderly - there is an increased risk after the age of 65. By age 85 or more, there is an almost 50% risk of acquiring the disease.
            Females - females are at a greater risk of contracting the disease than males.

            Genetics - if there is a genetic history of Alzheimer’s in the family, there is a greater risk of developing the disease.

        STAGE ONE
        STAGE TWO
        STAGE THREE
        The early stage of Alzheimer's Disease usually lasts two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawing from activities. If these symptoms are recognized and diagnosed at an early stage, it can save both the individual and their families time and hardship.
        During this stage you can expect the person with Alzheimer’s to forget experiences, rather than details (like names). The person may need minor assistance or reminders, but may be able to live alone competently. Efforts to hide confusion from others (the person usually knows something is not right) are sometimes successful at this early stage
        Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain. Symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss.
        This is similar to Alzheimer’s disease, but characterized more often by early changes in movement or the development of extra pyramidal symptoms. This includes: tremors; tics; rigidity; shuffling; gait, which can make individuals look like they have Parkinson’s disease.

        Alertness and severity of cognitive symptoms may fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis. There is often a poor tolerance to medications, as well as autonomic nervous system dysfunction. An example would be wild swings in blood pressure.
        Lewy body dementia can be challenging to diagnose because of it’s similarities to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

        GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
        When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it is administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. The administration of medication should be tailored to the individual. 

        Carers should constantly be aiming to identify links between certain behaviors and medications. Carers should employ strategies that do not require medications. Medications can and should be considered when such strategies are ineffective or not effective enough.

        Carers need to remember the importance of limiting the number of medications administered to patients and monitor which medications patients react well to and which ones they react poorly to. 

        It is important to provide medication in a slow and infrequent manner, because elderly people do not tolerate medications as well as younger people.
        Avoid medications with undesirable side effects, those which can cause more confusion or sedation, or worsen a patient's condition.
        Introduction to The Philosophy of Dementia Care
        INTRODUCTION
        RIGHTS
        This unit is designed to provide an overview of the philosophy and values of good dementia care based on the following concepts:
        A. People are unique and bring to the caregiving situation different perspectives and needs that shape the care environment.
        B. The essence of good Dementia care is the maintenance and enhancement of personhood within this environment. This approach to caring involves having respect for the personhood of those who have Dementia. This includes the equal respect for the personhood of those doing the work of caregiving.
        Care workers need to recognize that clients who have Dementia need to be treated the same as a client who has a broken hip. This unit will allow you to see clients who have Dementia as the patients that they really are.  
        This section focuses on medications that have been proven to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s. 
        COGNITIVE
        Aricept, Exelon, Razadyne: Indicated for mild dementia; used throughout the course of the disease. Side effects are mainly gastro-intestinal (GI) in nature, minimized by giving in the morning with food. There may also be vivid dreams or leg cramps.
        Namenda: Indicated for moderate dementia, used either alone or together with one of three medications previously noted.
        MOOD
        Antidepressants of the class known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally used. They address depression and anxiety. Medications such as tricyclics (for example, Elavil) and benzodiazepines (such as Lorazepam or Valium) should not be used because of the potential for increased confusion and dizziness and the increased risk of falls with potential injury.
        TREATMENTS B.
        The Condition of Alzheimer's Disease
        BEHAVIOURS
        EMOTIONS
        SLEEP/DELIRIUM
        When you work with a client who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (at any stage), it is important to know that their behavior can be unpredictable.
        This is often a response to discomfort, an unmet need, and increasing confusion. Patients also develop an increase in difficulty communicating, progressive loss of independence and poor insight and judgment.

        Key to reducing behavioral disturbances is to identify triggers. These include: pain; fatigue; acute illness; sensory deficits; hallucinations and/or delusions.
        Behaviors may be psychomotor (pacing, wandering, repeatedly crying out, etc.); verbal (belligerence, nastiness towards others, repetitiveness) and/or physical (combativeness, inappropriate touching). Careworkers need to be aware of these types of behaviors which can be expected from their clients. 
        Promoting a Caring Culture
        CARE CULTURE 1
        CARE CULTURE 2
        The new culture (N) of Dementia care outlined below, describes how care workers should go about their work when working with clients who have Dementia. Note how it contrasts with the old culture (O).
        O1: Dementias are diseases of the central nervous system. Personality and identity are destroyed.
        N1: Dementing illness should be seen as a form of disability. How a person is 
        affected depends on the care received.

        O2: The people with the best knowledge are doctors and brain scientists.
        N2: The people with the best knowledge are skilled and insightful caregivers.
        O3: Research is focused on a medical breakthrough. Until that comes, there is not much we can do for the person with Dementia.
        N3: There is a great deal we can do through human caring, insight and skill. This is the most urgent matter for research.

        ADJUSTING
        CAREGIVING
        The purpose of this unit is to discuss the realities of working with the families and friends of the client with Dementia and to determine methods for assisting families cope.
        Watching someone progress through the stages of Alzheimer’s or other dementia is very stressful. Also, there may be guilt associated with the inability to “do more to help the person.” When working with the families of a client, it is important to remember the following:
        - Family members adjust to the client's condition in unique, individual ways.


        - The process of adjustment involves grief and loss - anticipatory grief, i.e. grieving before death occurs.
        As a caregiver you need to be aware of people's attitudes - personal biases, prejudices and stereotypes. 

        Understanding different values and being aware of cultural differences, where it's applicable, will make you a better carer.

        Where necessary, try to get information about the patient’s culture/preferences. Make sure you adapt the care to fit their preferences and demands. Diversity includes race, ethnicity (culture), nationality, religion (or none) and sexual orientation.
        At times, it can be quite difficult for care workers to empathize with a patient with Dementia. Let’s take some time to complete this exercise that could help you see Dementia from a different perspective.

        Imagine a future in which you are in your seventies or eighties and suffering from Dementia. None of your family is able to care for you at home and you have moved into residential care. In the present, you know yourself and your personal history very well. Use your knowledge about yourself as you are now to pick out the information which would help the people who care for you in this imaginary future to maintain your well-being as far as possible. What would you need to sustain your well-being?
        QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
        1.  Everyday tastes and habits: How could it help you feel more settled if your caregivers knew about them?
        2.  Your body and your health: What should they know?
        3.  Fears and past events - If they understood these, could they respond more sympathetically?
        4.  Interests and activities - How can they help you sustain your sense of independence?
        5.  Still thinking of you as an older person with dementia: What do you most dread? What is your greatest hope?
        RULES A.
        Acknowledging the Experiences of Family Members
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES A.
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES B.
        Family members can react in unique and individual ways when a loved one is diagnosed with Dementia. The most common reactions are outlined below:

        DENIAL: Reflects the initial response that nothing is wrong. Denial is a natural reaction; can prevent a family from seeking help; can create family conflict. Helpful Interventions: Provide accurate information on Dementia when appropriate; Listen without judging; Do not assume person is in denial. There may be a lack of information amongst family members.

        OVER INVOLVEMENT: The primary caregiver may try to meet all the needs of the person with memory loss and refuse help from everyone; caregiver believes they are helping; can create a barrier to getting further help. Helpful Interventions: Involve family member in care and care planning; Encourage family member to express painful feelings such as guilt, loss and anger.

        ANGER: Resulting from the physical, emotional, financial burden of providing care. Can stem from feelings of loss and abandonment. Angry feelings can cause guilt. Helpful Interventions: Discuss anger at the disease rather than at people. Encourage interaction with other families going through the experience. Listen without judging or taking sides. Encourage caregiver to take some time for his/her self.
        Lesson Summary

            Dementia refers to a spectrum of brain disorders, involving difficulty with memory and thinking; symptoms vary in their causes, courses and prognoses.
            Symptoms of Dementia include: decline in memory, thinking and reasoning; change in personality, mood and behavior; difficulty communicating, recognizing people and places and engaging in activities.
            Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of Dementia. It is progressive and irreversible. Early diagnosis and recognition of symptoms is important for care.
            When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it should be administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. 
            Vascular or Multi-Infarct Dementia, is the second most common form of Dementia, estimated to account for approx. 20% of cases. It is caused by reduced blood flow to parts of the brain, often due to tiny strokes which block small arteries.
            Fronto-Temporal Dementia causes personality and behavioral changes and loss of language function. 
            Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain; symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss. The early stage lasts for two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawal from activities. The middle stage is characterized by increase in memory loss, confusion, shorter attention span, increase in language difficulties and repetitiveness. The late stage is a period of severe confusion and loss of all functional skills; the person has no awareness of their condition. This lasts for approx. 1-3 years and ends in death.
            Caregivers (professional or family members), must take steps to safeguard their own health and well-being when caring for

            Effective Approaches
            INTRODUCTION
            APPROACH
            This unit is designed to provide guidelines for communicating with the person with Alzheimer’s Disease. This unit expands on the culture of care section and suggests practical applications for handling communication by using the “soft approach” and redirecting the person with Dementia, where possible, to produce a more positive interaction.
            In communicating with the person with Dementia, you will need to:
            - Introduce yourself by name/association.
            - Validate responses and feelings verbally.
            - Use short simple sentences.
            - Ask primarily yes/no questions.
            - Allow time for responses.
            Verbal and Non-Verbal Techniques
            VERBAL
            NON-VERBAL
            In the early, and for part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person with Dementia. They allow you to redirect the person to achieve a more positive interaction.
            Consider the following example. The client says:
            Scenarios: Self-Reflection Exercise
            COMMUNICATION SCENARIO A.
            The following scenarios represent situations that will allow you to consider the communication techniques necessary when treating clients with Dementia. 
            CASE SCENARIO ONE: Margaret at Bedtime
            Laurie was assigned to assist Margaret with getting ready for bed. Margaret was accustomed to putting her nightgown on by herself and was very shy about being undressed. Laurie knocked on the door and entered Margaret’s room to assist her. She found Margaret had put her nightgown on over her clothes. Laurie didn’t think that Margaret would be comfortable sleeping in her clothes, so she wanted to convince Margaret to take off the nightgown. Margaret resisted and Laurie began using a hands-on approach to help her. Since Margaret’s ability to communicate is moderately impaired and she was unable to express her fears and frustration, she became increasingly agitated. She tried to tell Laurie that she was shy and embarrassed, but could not verbalize her feelings and instead pushed Laurie away and threw the nightgown on the floor.


            QUESTIONS:
            (a) What would you do to help Margaret cope with her escalating behavior, help restore her dignity and provide assistance in getting ready for bed?
            (b) Think about this scenario and determine which communication
            “My mother is coming to get me.” If you said, “No, your mother died years ago,” the client would either begin to grieve for her or refuse to believe what you are saying. Instead try something like: “You must miss her. What kind of work did she do?” or “What things did you enjoy doing together?”
            These statements allow the client to respond to the idea of the lost person and go with the flow of the ideas. Direct the client to think about positive memories of the person, rather than the idea that their mother is no longer aliv

            - Use word cues - try to guess what the person want

        Communicating with Colleagues
        If you are providing care to a patient with Dementia in a formal setting (i.e working for a care agency), chances are that you administer care to your patient with the support of at least one of your colleagues. It is vital to maintain a professional and healthy relationship with your colleagues. If you fail to do so, it will effect the standard of care you can provide to your patient. 
        Follow the tips outlined below in order to maintain a healthy relationship with your colleagues:
        Maintain good eye contact.
        Speak clearly and directly.
        Use the person’s name whenever possible.
        Use a friendly tone of voice. 
        Ask for repetition or clarification if you are unclear about a message. 	Never yell or discuss client care in front of that client or other people
        Carefully report critical information related to a client's achievements and challenges.
        Take notes when a
        Teamwork
        It is important to remember that one person cannot administer care to a person with Dementia. It takes a team. This team will not always be a formal team consisting of coworkers. It can also consist of family members or friends. 
        To build a strong team, follow the T.E.A.M. guidelines below:
        Trust yourself and others. Trust builds a sense of acceptance of others. Trust creates confidence in self and others. Trust establishes a “safe harbor” and feelings of security.
        Empower yourself to be your best. Empowering gives permission to excel. Empowering challenges your ability to be creative and innovative. Empowering authorizes you to explore your talent and uniqueness.	Attitude can be your best friend (you decide). Attitude creates positive and negative reactions. A “Can do” attitude motivates others. Attitude reflects your true character.
        Model teamwork to others. Modeling good teamwork is an example for others. Modeling exhibits a sense of cooperation. Modeling encourages others to be “team minded”

        Dealing with Difficult Behaviour
        INTRODUCTION
        CAUSES
        APPROACH
        Caregivers need to be aware of the types of behaviors they are likely to encounter when working with clients with Dementia. 
        This unit defines “problem” behaviors commonly seen and provides methods for assessing, preventing and dealing with difficult situations.
        COMMON BEHAVIORS:
        - Resisting/fighting hands-on caregivers
        - Wandering and rummaging
        - Physical restlessness
        - Eating problems
        - Sleep disturbances
        - Disruptive yelling or moaning
        - Problematic sexual behavior/ disrobing
        Effective Approaches to Care
        INTERVENTION
        COMFORT
        ANTICIPATE NEEDS
        Do not intervene when a person with Dementia is exhibiting “problem” behavior, unless one of the following applies:


        - The behavior violates the rights of others.
        - The behavior poses a threat to someone’s health and safety.
        When it is necessary to intervene, make sure you do so in a manner that does not endanger the client or other people.
        Turning Negatives into Positives
        SOLUTIONS A.
        It can be useful to engage the client in personally meaningful activities that draws their attention away from upsetting and distressing situations. Examples include:
        - Offer something to eat or drink.
        - Go for a walk; go outdoors.
        - Talk in a calm, soothing way.
        - Play music; sing a song.
        - Look at pictures.
        - Say a prayer; sing a hymn.
        - Pleasant exercise.
        - Reminiscing.
        Therapeutic Activities
        INTRODUCTION
        ACTIVITIES
        BENEFITS
        GUIDELINES
        In this unit, you will learn that activities are the foundation of care. Every event, encounter or exchange is an activity. The scope of activities includes everyday interactions with staff, volunteers, relatives and other individuals.

        In this topic, you will learn how to determine which type of activity is best to suit your client at different times. You will examine activities that are suited to all forms of Alzheimer’s in particular. However these can be used for clients with other forms of dementia.

        The activities that make up a client's daily experience should reflect as much as possible that person's preferred individual lifestyle, whilst enabling a sense of usefulness and success at their level of functioning.

        Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disease. The person with dementia has difficulty doing, or is unable to do, the things that he/she previously enjoyed doing. Cultivating activities with meaningful interactions for the person with memory loss is part of providing successful experiences.
        Lesson Summary

            When communicating with a person with Dementia, one should: introduce oneself by name and association; validate responses and feelings verbally; use short simple sentences; ask primarily yes/no questions; allow time for responses; use word cues; try to guess what the person wants.
            In the early and part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person. This allow you to redirect the person and to achieve a more positive interaction with them.
            When communicating with a client, the goal is to avoid situations likely to create anxiety and conflict, as both will cause the client stress.
            Caregivers must be proactive by anticipating the client's needs ahead of time, especially since clients may not be able to verbalize their needs.
            The activities that make up a client's daily experience, should reflect as much as possible that person's individual preferences. They should enable a sense of usefulness and success at as normal a level of functioning as is possible.
            Activities should help to maintain the independence and physical well being of patients and enhance their quality of life, by providing them with mental stimulation and opportunities to engage in socialization.
            The guidelines for choosing activities include selecting activities that are interesting and stimulating and that consider the person's individuality and environment.
            One person only cannot administer care to a person with dementia; it takes a team.

            TWITTER
            Social networking sites, such as MySpace and virtual worlds, such as Second Life, make it easier for fans to search for new music and easier for artists to
            communicate with their fans. 
            In fact, MySpace has been so influential that it has teamed up with several major labels, to create the MySpace music website. Generating a buzz on social networking sites is sometimes enough to achieve fame and stardom. 


            She considered her music to be a hobby rather than a career choice. [1] Fast-forward a year later and Caillat’s debut album, Coco, was at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, on its way to achieving platinum status. How did an unknown artist from Malibu, California, become a best-selling star in so little time? Caillat’s success can be attributed, in part, to the social networking website 'MySpace'.

        Early Music Technology
        PHONOGRAPHS
        The first stirrings of popular or pop music—any genre of music that appeals to a wide audience or subculture—began in the late 19th century, with discoveries by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner.
        In 1877, Edison discovered that sound could be reproduced using a strip of tinfoil wrapped around a rotating metal cylinder. Edison’s phonograph provided ideas and inspiration for Berliner’s gramophone, which used flat discs to record sound.
        Copyright and New Music Genres
        COPYRIGHT
        POPULAR GENRES
        In the late 19th century, the lax copyright laws that existed in the United States at the beginning of the century were strengthened, providing an opportunity for composers, singers, and publishers to work together to earn money, by producing as much music as possible. 
        Numerous publishers began to emerge in an area of New York that became known as Tin Pan Alley. Allegedly named because the cacophony of many pianos being played in the publishers’ demo rooms sounded like people pounding on tin pans. 
        Tin Pan Alley soon became a prolific source of popular music, with its publishers mass-producing sheet music to satisfy the demands of a growing middle class.

        Radio and Jazz Music
        RADIO
        Radio was an affordable medium that enabled listeners to experience events as they took place. Better yet, it offered a wide range of free music that required none of the musical skills, expensive instruments, or sheet music necessary for creating one’s own music in the home, nor the expense of purchasing records to play on the gramophone.

        This development was a threat to the entire recording industry, which began to campaign for, and was ultimately granted, the right to collect license fees from broadcasters. With the license fees in place, the recording industry eventually began to profit from the new technology.
        The Tin Pan Alley tradition of song publishing, continued throughout the first half of the 20th century, with the show tunes and soothing ballads of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. This included songwriting teams of the early 1950s, such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. 
        By hiring songwriters to compose music based on public demand and mainstream tastes, the Tin Pan Alley publishers introduced the concept of 'popular music' as we know it.

        INTEGRATION
        BLUES
        Jazz became a "legitimate form of entertainment" during the 1930s, when white orchestras began to incorporate jazz style into their music. 
        During this time, jazz music began to 
        take on a big band style, combining elements of ragtime, black spirituals, blues, and European music. 

        Key figures in developing the 'big jazz band' included bandleaders Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, and Glenn Miller. These big band orchestras used an arranger, to limit improvisation, by assigning parts of a piece of music to various band members. 
        Electric Guitar and Radio
        ELECTRIC GUITAR
        RADIO STATIONS
        Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, were the first to electrify the blues, through the use of electric guitars and to blend an urban style with classic Southern blues. 

        The electric guitar, first produced by Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931, changed music by intensifying the sound and creating a louder volume that could cut through noise in bars and nightclubs. [4] 
        By focusing less on shouting, singers could focus on conveying more emotion and intimacy in their performances. This electrified form of blues provided the foundation for rock and roll.
        Recording and Playback
        TAPE RECORDING
        MULTI-TRACK
        RECORDS
        Technological advances during the 1940s, made it even easier for people to listen to their favorite music and for artists to record it.
        The introduction of the reel-to-reel tape recorder, paved the way for several innovations that would transform the music industry. 
        The first commercially available tape recorders were monophonic, meaning that they recorded sound onto magnetic tape, using only one track. This may seem limiting today, but at the time it allowed for exciting innovations.

        During the 1940s, a mutually beneficial alliance between sound recording and radio existed. Artists such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald profited from radio exposure. Until this time, music had primarily been recorded for adults, but the popularity of Sinatra and his contemporaries revealed an entirely untapped market: teenagers. 

        The postwar boom of the 1930s and early 1940s, provided many teenagers with the spending money for records. Radio airplay helped to promote and sell records and the recording artists themselves, which in turn stabilized the recording industry. The near-riots caused by the appearance of New Jersey crooner Frank Sinatra in concert, paved the way for mass hysteria among Elvis Presley and Beatles fans during the rock and roll era.
        Rhythm and Blues
        R & B
        Technology wasn’t the only revolution that took place during the 1950s. The urban Chicago blues, typified by artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, and B. B. King, surged in popularity among white and black teenagers alike.  
        Marketed under the name rhythm and blues, or R&B, the sexually suggestive lyrics in songs such as “Sexy Ways” and “Sixty Minute Man”; the electrified guitar and wailing harmonica sounds, appealed to young listeners.

        Prior to 1964, rock and roll was primarily an American export. Although U.S. artists frequently reached the top of the charts overseas, few European artists achieved success on the U.S. side of the Atlantic. 
        This situation changed almost overnight, with the arrival of British pop phenomenon the Beatles. Their music combined elements of skiffle—a type of music played on rudimentary instruments, such as banjos, guitars, or homemade instruments—doo-wop and soul. The four "mop-haired" musicians from Liverpool, England, created a genre of music known as Merseybeat, named after the River Mersey
        Although banned from some stations, others embraced the popular new music. In 1951, DJ Alan Freed started a late-night R&B show called 'The Moondog Rock & Roll House Party' and began referring to the music he played as rock and roll. [5] 
        Taking its name from a blues slang term for sex, the music obtained instant notoriety, gaining widespread support among teenage music fans and widespread dislike among the older generation. [6] 
        Frenetic showmen Little Richard and Chuck Berry were early pioneers of rock and roll, and their wild stage performances became characteristic of the genre. 
        Emerging Genres
        SOUL MUSIC
        In Detroit, some black performers were developing a sound that would have crossover appeal with both black and white audiences. Combining R&B, pop, gospel, and blues into a genre known as soul, vocalists such as James Brown and Aretha Franklin sang about the lives of black Americans. 

        Producer and songwriter Berry Gordy Jr., developed soul music through the creation of his Motown label, which would become one of the most successful businesses owned by a black person in American history. [10]
         
        Capitalizing on the 1960s girl-group craze, Gordy produced hits by the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas and, most successfully, Diana Ross and the Supremes. For his bands, he created a slick, polished image, designed to appeal to the American mainstream.

        GANGSTA RAP
        RIVALRY
        In the early 1980s, a second wave of rap artists brought inner-city rap to American youths, by mixing it with hard guitar rock. Pioneered by groups such as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, the new music appealed to black and white audiences alike.
        Another subgenre that emerged was gangsta rap, a controversial brand of hip-hop, epitomized by West Coast rappers such as Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur. Highlighting violence and gang warfare, gangsta rappers faced accusations that they created violence in inner cities—an argument that gained momentum with the East Coast–West Coast rivalry of the 1990s.
        Whereas many British youths expressed their displeasure through punk music, many disenfranchised black American youths in the 1980s, turned to hip-hop—a term for the urban culture that includes break dancing, graffiti art, gangs and the musical techniques of rapping, sampling, and scratching records.

        MP3s
        In the mid-1990s, CD sales were booming. Cassette tapes were all but obsolete, and record companies were reaping the benefits of sales to consumers, who wanted their music collections in the latest technological format. 
        This boom was a familiar step in the evolution of technology. In past decades, records seemed to have an ironclad lock on sales, but they were eventually surpassed by cassette sales. Cassettes were then surpassed by CD sales. 
        However, despite a few advantages in quality and convenience, there were several areas in which CDs were lacking. They were expensive for consumers to purchase, and consumers had to buy a full album, even if they were only interested in listening to one or two songs, because every album came as a complete package.
        In Weezer’s 2008 song “Pork and Beans,” vocalist Rivers Cuomo sings, “Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts...Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art.” [1] 
        The lyrics, a reference to hip-hop producer Timbaland’s multiple high-profile collaborations, are an angry reaction to a meeting between Cuomo and record executives at the band’s Geffen label. 
        During the meeting, the executives told the band members they needed to write more commercial material, prompting a defiant (though commercially successful) response. [2] 
        The tight-knit relationship between music and culture is almost impossible to overstate. For example, policies on immigration, war, and the legal system, can influence artists and the type of music 
        they create and distribute. 

        Music may then influence cultural perceptions about race, morality, and
        gender that can, in turn, influence the way people feel about those policies.

        Reacting against the extravagance of disco, many poor urban "rappers" developed a new street culture, by adopting a casual image consisting of T-shirts and sportswear. 
        They developed a language that reflected the everyday concerns of people living in low-income urban areas and embraced the visual art form of graffiti. They described their new culture as hip-hop, after a common phrase chanted at dance parties in New York’s Bronx borough.
        MUSIC
        After the Vietnam War ended, college students began to settle down and focus on careers and families. For some, selfish views took the place of concern with social issues and political activism, causing writer Tom Wolfe to label the 1970s the “me” decade. [13] 
        Musically, this ideological shift resulted in the creation of glam rock, an extravagant, self-indulgent form of rock that incorporated flamboyant costumes, heavy makeup, and elements of hard rock and pop. 
        A primarily British phenomenon, glam rock was popularized by acts such as Slade, David Bowie, the Sweet, Elton John, and Gary Glitter. 
        Having earned himself a reputation as a political spokesperson, Dylan was
        lambasted by traditional folk fans, for playing an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.
        However, his attempt to reach a broader crowd, inspired the folk rock genre, pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds [11]. Even though many fans questioned his decision to go electric, Dylan’s poetic and politically charged lyrics were still influential, inspiring groups like the Beatles and the Animals.

        Initially done only by a tech-savvy elite, the process of downloading and sharing audio files was a painstaking process, because MP3 files were not in one centralized location. 
        Peer-to-peer file sharing—the process in which two or more computer
        systems are connected over the Internet, for the purpose of sharing music or video files—became a worldwide phenomenon in 1999, with the development of the centralized online file-sharing system 'Napster'.

        Not content with pursuing providers of illegal music downloads, the RIAA also took legal action against the users of sites such as LimeWire and Kazaa. In 2003, the recording industry sued 261 American music fans, for illegally sharing songs on P2P networks. [7] 

        Although fines under U.S. copyright law can rise up to $150,000 per illegally downloaded track, most of the cases were settled for much less. In 2008, the RIAA had sued or threatened to sue more than 30,000 individuals for copyright infringement. [8]
        The Gnutella network, which serves clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX, avoided maintaining a central database. 
        Instead, it dispersed information about file locations, across computer “nodes” around the world. Users were able to find each other, but the service could disclaim the ability to prevent copyright infringements. 
        The lack of a centralized server and multiple client base meant that, unlike Napster, it would be impossible to shut down the entire Gnutella network through a simple court order. Courts would need to block all Gnutella network traffic at the Internet service provider (ISP) level of the Internet, a far trickier prospect than simply shutting down a central database.
        Most recording artists sided with the record labels, with heavy metal rock group Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre launching their own separate lawsuits against Napster in April 2000. However, some bands discovered a way to use the site to their advantage.
        Alternative rock group Radiohead promoted its album 'Kid A', by secretly releasing the record to Napster, 3 weeks before its street release date, creating a wave of publicity that launched the album to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart in October 2000. [4] 
        Reggae-rock band Dispatch poured free recordings onto the site, increasing its fan base to such an extent that it sold out multiple nights at Madison Square Garden in early 2007. [5]

        Several companies have attempted to cash in on the success of iTunes, with varying results. In 2007, Internet giant Amazon.com launched the Amazon MP3 digital music download store, that initially offered more than 2 million songs, priced between $0.89 and $0.99. [11] 
        Amazon’s major selling point was its lack of digital rights management (DRM) software, which enabled music downloads to be played on any hardware device. 
        In contrast, songs downloaded through iTunes, could only be played on Apple products. Apple removed these restrictions in 2009, after negotiating an agreement with the major record labels.

        Once digital music technology was introduced to the world, its domination of the music industry was almost instantaneous. 
        MP3 players have several key advantages over CD players. They are smaller and more portable, eliminating the necessity of lugging around bulky CD carrying cases. 
        Whereas CDs can only hold a relatively small amount of data, MP3 players are able to compress thousands of songs onto a single device (however, this lack of packaging and manufacturing has caused disputes between artists and labels over royalties). 

        The lack of moving parts, means MP3 players can be taken jogging or cycling, without the risk of a song skipping every time the user hits a bumpy patch of road. Users are also no longer obligated to buy entire albums; instead, they can pick and choose their favorite songs from a catalog of online music.
        Module One Summary

            Popular music as we know it, originated out of the Tin Pan Alley tradition that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century in which composers, singers, and publishers worked together to create hit songs. 
            Whereas classical music was exalted for its individuality and stylistic differences, popular music is praised for conforming to the tastes of the audience.
            Technological developments played a crucial role in bringing popular music into people’s homes. 
            The invention of the phonograph and gramophone in the late 19th century, enabled the reproduction and mass distribution of sound recordings. 
            The invention of the reel-to-reel tape recorder and the development of vinyl records in the 1940s, significantly improved the music recording process. 
            The postwar prevalence of radio, hugely impacted popular music, with radio airplay of popular songs promoting record sales.
            Jazz and blues originally emerged from New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s. As many people migrated to Northern urban areas for economic reasons, this had an impact on the kind of music that was created.

                In 1983, radio station WOXY’s new owners bought the station and changed its format from a Top 40, to an up-and-coming alternative rock format, kicking off with U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday.” [1] 
                Then located in the basement of a fast-food restaurant in Ohio, the station was a risk for its purchasers, a husband and wife team, who took a chance by changing the format to a relatively new one. 
                Their investment paid off with the success of their station. By 1990, WOXY had grown in prestige to become one of Rolling Stone magazine’s top 15 radio stations in the country and had even been made famous by a reference in the 1988 film Rain Man. [2] 

                In 1998, the station launched a web cast and developed a national following, ranking 12th among Internet broadcasters for listenership in 2004. [3]

            HISTORY
            Wireless technology made radio as it is known today possible, but its modern, practical function as a mass communication medium had been the domain of other technologies for some time.  

            As early as the 1880s, people relied on telephones to transmit news, music, church sermons, and weather reports. In Budapest, Hungary, for example, a subscription service allowed individuals to listen to news reports and fictional stories on their telephones. [11] 

            Around this time, telephones also transmitted opera performances from
            Paris to London. In 1909, this innovation emerged in the United States, as a 'pay-per-play' phonograph service in Wilmington, Delaware. [12] This service allowed subscribers to listen to specific music recordings on their telephones. [13]
            When Marconi popularized wireless technology, contemporaries initially viewed it as a way to allow the telegraph to function in places that could not be connected by cables. 
            Early radios acted as devices for naval ships to communicate with other ships and with land stations; the focus was on person-to-person
            communication. 
            However, the potential for broadcasting—sending messages to a large group of potential listeners—wasn’t realized until later in the development of the medium.
            AMATEUR RADIO
            At its most basic level, radio is communication through the use of radio waves. This includes radio used for person-to-person communication, as well as radio used for mass communication. 
            Both of these functions are still practiced today. Although most people associate the term radio, with radio stations that broadcast to the general public, radio wave technology is used in everything from television to cell phones, making it a primary conduit for person-to-person communication.

        DEVELOPMENT
        After the World War I radio ban was lifted, with the close of the conflict in 1919, a number of small stations began operating using technologies that had developed during the war. 
        Many of these stations developed regular programming schdules, that included religious sermons, sports, and news. [16] As early as 1922, Schenectady, New York’s WGY, broadcast over 40 original dramas, showing radio’s potential as a medium for drama.
        The WGY players created their own scripts and performed them live on air. This same groundbreaking group also made the first known attempt at television drama in 1928. [17]

        In the mid-1920s, profit-seeking companies such as department stores and newspapers, owned a majority of the nation’s broadcast radio stations, which promoted their owners’ businesses. [23] 
        Nonprofit groups, such as churches and schools, operated another third of the stations. As the number of radio stations outgrew the available frequencies, interference became problematic, and the government stepped into the fray.
        The Radio Act of 1927 established the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), to oversee regulation of the airwaves. A year after its creation, the FRC reallocated station bandwidths to correct interference problems. 
        Not long after radio’s broadcast debut, large businesses saw its potential profitability and formed networks. In 1926, RCA started the National Broadcasting Network (NBC). 
        Groups of stations that carried syndicated network programs, along with a variety of local shows, soon formed its Red and Blue networks. 
        Two years after the creation of NBC, the United Independent Broadcasters became the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and began competing with the existing Red and Blue networks

        The so-called Golden Age of Radio occurred between 1930 and the mid-1950s. Because many associate the 1930s with the struggles of the Great Depression, it may seem contradictory that such a 
        fruitful cultural occurrence arose during this decade. 

        However, radio lent itself to the era. After the initial purchase of a receiver, radio was free and so provided an inexpensive source of entertainment that replaced other, more costly pastimes, such as going to the movies.
        Radio also presented an easily accessible form of media that existed on its own schedule. Unlike reading newspapers or books, tuning in to a favorite program at a certain time became a part of listeners’ daily routine, because it effectively forced them to plan their lives around the

        WW2
        By the late 1930s, the popularity of radio news broadcasts had surpassed that of newspapers. Radio’s ability to emotionally draw its audiences in close to events, made for news that evoked stronger responses and, thus, greater interest than print news could. 
        For example, the infant son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Radio networks set up mobile stations that covered events as they unfolded, broadcasting nonstop for several days and keeping listeners updated on every detail, while tying them emotionally to the outcome.

        Despite the networks’ hold on programming, educational stations persisted at universities and in some municipalities. They broadcast programs such as the School of the Air and College of the Air, as well as roundtable and town hall forums. 
        In 1940, the FCC reserved a set of frequencies in the lower range of the FM radio spectrum, for public education purposes, as part of its regulation of the new spectrum. 
        The reservation of FM frequencies gave educational stations a boost, but FM proved intitally unpopular, due to a setback in 1945, when the FCC moved the FM bandwidth to a higher set of frequencies, ostensibly to avoid problems with interference. [12] 
        The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and ushered in a new era of government regulation. The organization quickly began enacting influential radio decisions.
        Among these was the 1938 decision to limit stations to 50,000 watts of broadcasting power, a ceiling that remains in effect today. [9] 
        As a result of FCC antimonopoly rulings, RCA was forced to sell its NBC Blue network; this spun-off division became the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1943. [10]

        Early radio network programming laid the groundwork for television’s format, with many different programs that appealed to a variety of people, broadcast at different times of the day. 
        As television’s popularity grew, however, radio could not compete and so it turned to fresh programming techniques. A new type of format-driven station became the norm. Propelled by the development of new types of music, such as psychedelic rock and smooth jazz, the evolution of radio station formats took place. 
        Since the beginning of this shift, different stations have tended to focus on the music that certain demographics prefer to hear.

        CONTROVERSIAL
        Another important innovation in radio in the U.S. was the growth of border stations. Located just across the Mexican border, these stations did not have to follow FCC or U.S. regulatory laws. 
        Because the stations broadcast at 250,000 watts and higher, their listening range covered much of North America. Their content also diverged markedly from that of U.S. stations.

Branded in the 1980s, this format encompassed stations that had a Top 40 orientation, but drew on a wide number of formats, such as country, rock, and urban. [4] 
        In 2010, pop CHR ranked first among teenage listeners, with 65 percent of its overall listeners aged under 35. This music, ranging from popular artists like Taylor Swift and Kanye West to Shakira, was played in the car more than at home or work and saw its largest listening times in the evenings. Rhythmic CHR, a subformat focusing on a mix of rhythmic pop, R&B, dance, and hip-hop hits, also ranked high in 2010. [5]
        Country music as a format includes stations devoted both to older and newer country music. In 2010, the country music format stood as the most popular radio format, beating out even such prominent non-music formats as news and talk. 
        The format commanded the greatest listener share and the second largest number of stations dedicated to the style. Favored in rural regions of the country, the country music format—featuring artists like Keith Urban, the Dixie Chicks, and Tim McGraw—appeals to both male and female listeners, from a variety of income levels.

        Since its inception, radio’s impact on American culture has been immense. Modern popular culture is unthinkable without the early influence of radio. 
        Entire genres of music that are now taken for granted, such as country and rock, owe their popularity and even existence, to early radio progr

        CONSUMERISM
        Radio programs reflected the nationwide cultural aspect of radio. Vox Pop, a show originally based on person-in-the-street interviews, was an early attempt to quantify the United States’ growing mass culture.
        Beginning in 1935, the program billed itself as an unrehearsed “cross-section of what the average person really knows”, by asking random people an assortment of questions. 
        Many modern television shows still employ this format, not only for viewers’ amusement and information, but also as an attempt to sum up national culture. [1] 'Vox Pop' functioned on a cultural level, as an acknowledgement of radio’s entrance into people’s private lives, to make them public. [2]

        Although technological advances in the past 50 years, such as audio recorders and microphones, have made creating radio programs easier, finding a way to broadcast programs, presents a difficulty for the average person. 
        The technology of the Internet, however, has transformed this limitation, into a manageable hurdle for both businesses and individuals.
        STREAMING



        CUSTOMIZED
        Developed around 2001 to help terrestrial radio stations compete with emerging satellite radio technology, HD radio is essentially a digital transmission of radio signals, resulting in less static and better sound quality, even for AM stations. 
        Upgraded quality is not the major benefit of HD radio, however; the technology allows signals to be compressed, so that one station can air so-called "shadow stations" on the same frequency as its regular broadcast. 
        Although listeners need a HD radio to receive these channels, they pay no subscription fee, as independent stations provide their own programming, as they deem necessary. [3]
        Although the future of radio has been doubted many times throughout its history, it is still in existence. The inherent portability of the medium, gives it an advantage over other types of media, 
        that require an individual’s full attention, such as television or print. 

        The simplicity of radio has leant itself to a variety of uses. In recent years, new technologies have promised to expand the reach of radio and to expand the kinds of programming it offers. Satellite and HD radio have increased the amount and diversity of available programming, by making more stations available. 
        Internet radio has increased the accessibility of radio communication, and practically anyone who has access to a computer, can create subscription podcasts to distribute around the world. These new technologies promise to
        make radio an enduring, innovative form of media.

        SUCCESS
        Unlike Internet radio, podcasting employs downloadable rather than streamed content. The term podcasting, stems from the use of MP3 players, such as Apple’s iPod. 
        Many terrestrial stations have employed podcasting to supplement their traditional over-the-air broadcasting. Because these are single programs, rather than continuous streaming, podcasts are an easier medium to produce than Internet radio.
        Just as radio evolved from a medium for soap operas and live music to talk shows and recorded music, podcasts are a window into what radio may evolve into in the future.
        Despite the rise of Internet radio over the past several years, its success has never been a sure thing. As the trend gained momentum, many inexperienced broadcasters confronted the issue of 
        royalties, and many experienced broadcasters encountered new legal issues related to streaming. 

        Stations that broadcast over the airwaves must pay publishing royalties to the musicians and songwriters behind the recordings. Rather than pay an individual musician or songwriter each time a recording is played, however,
        broadcasters—including radio stations, coffee shops, and restaurants—pay for a blanket license, that allows them to play any song. 
        Lesson Summary

            The Golden Age of Radio covered the period between 1930 and 1950. It was characterized by radio’s overwhelming popularity and a wide range of programming, including variety, music, drama and theater programs.
            Top 40 radio, arose after most non-music programming moved to television. This format used short playlists of popular hits and gained a great deal of commercial success during the 1950s and 1960s.
            FM radio became popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, as commercial stations tried to appeal to new audiences, who desired higher fidelity and a less restrictive format.
            Empowered by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, media conglomerates have subsumed an unprecedented number of radio stations, merging them into single corporations. 
            Radio station consolidation tends to bring more predictability and profits, at the expense of independent programs.
            Radio station formats (interviews, news, music etc.) tend to use particular advertising products to target their particular audience demographic.
            Contemporary hit radio was developed as a Top 40 format and expanded beyond pop music to include country, rock and other genres.
            Spanish-language formats have grown in recent years, with the 'Mexican Regional' format moving into the to
            Nostalgia genres have developed to reflect the tastes of aging listeners, including music mixes from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
            Radio is unique as a form of mass media, as it has the potential to reach anyone, even the illiterate. 
            Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events directly to the listening public and was used to create a sense of national unity.
            Radio encouraged the growth of popular music stars and brought regional sounds to wider audiences. 
            The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated that radio stations must give equal time to contrasting points of view.
            An enormous rise in the popularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, when commentators were free to broadcast a biased perspective.
            The need for radio stations to generate revenue, places practical limits on what radio personalities can say on the air. 
            Shock jocks such as Howard Stern and Don Imus, test and sometimes exceed "acceptable limits". They have become controversial personalities, highlighting the tension that exists between freedom of speech on the one hand and the need for business to be profitable on the other.
            Radio’s flexibility as a medium, has allowed it to survive the fluctuations of audience tastes and markets.
            Satellite radio, as a monthly subscription service, provides access to unlimited, commercial free and uncensored broadcasting.

                In 2009, many moviegoers were amazed by the three-dimensional (3-D) film Avatar. Avatar grossed over $1.8 billion in theaters worldwide; $1.35 billion from 3-D sales alone. [1] 
                Following in that vein, dozens of other movie studios released 3-D films, resulting in lesser box office successes, such as Alice in Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, and Shrek Forever After. Many film reviewers and audiences seemed adamant—3-D movies were the wave of the future. 

                Throughout the history of film, Technicolor dyes, enhanced sound systems, and computer-generated graphics have boasted huge box-office revenues; however, it’s ultimately the viewers who determine what a good movie is and who set the standard for future films.

            PROMOTION
            In the movie industry today, publicity and product are two sides of the same coin. Even films that get a lousy critical reception can do extremely well in ticket sales, if their marketing campaigns manage to create enough hype. Similarly, two comparable films can produce very different results at the box office, if they have been given different levels of publicity. 
            This explains why the film 'What Women Want', starring Mel Gibson, brought in $33.6 million in its opening weekend in 2000. However, a few months later, 'The Million Dollar Hotel', starring Gibson, only brought in $29,483 during its opening weekend. [1] Unlike in the days of the Hollywood studio system, actors alone no longer draw audiences in to see movies. 
            The first technology for home video recording, Sony’s Betamax cassettes, hit the market in 1975. The device, a combined television set and videocassette recorder (VCR), came with the high price tag of $2,495, making it a luxury still too expensive for the average American home. 
            Two years later, RCA released the vertical helical scan (VHS) system of recording, which would eventually outsell Betamax, though neither device was yet a popular consumer product. 
            Within several years however, the concept of home movie recording and viewing was beginning to catch on. In 1979, Columbia Pictures released 20 films for home viewing and a year later Disney entered the market with the first authorized video rental plan for retail stores. 
            While the development of narrative film was largely driven by commercial factors, it is also important to acknowledge the role of individual artists who turned it into a medium of personal expression. 
            The motion picture of the silent era was generally simplistic in nature; acted in overly-animated movements, to engage the eye; accompanied by live music, played by musicians in the theater and including written titles, to create a mood and to narrate a story. 
            Within the confines of this medium, one filmmaker in particular emerged to
            transform the silent film into an art and to unlock its potential as a medium of serious expression and persuasion; D.W. Griffith.

            ADVERTISING
            The Hollywood “dream factory,” as Hortense Powdermaker labeled it in her 1950 book on the movie industry, [3] manufactures an experience that is part art and part commercial product. [4]  The films the studios churn out, are the result of a capitalist enterprise that ultimately looks to the “bottom line” to guide most major decisions. 
            Hollywood is an industry and as in any other industry in a mass market, its success relies on the control of resources, access to mass distribution and effective marketing strategies. This helps to maximize the product’s reach and to minimize competition. [5] In this way, Hollywood has an enormous influence on the films to which the public has access to.
            Costs and Models
            COSTS
            While it may seem that the major studios are making heavy profits, movie making today is a much riskier and less profitable enterprise than it was in the studio system era. 
            The massive budgets required for the global marketing of a film, are huge financial gambles. In fact, most movies cost the studios more to market and produce—upwards of $100 million—than the returns generated at the box-office. 
            With such high stakes, studios have come to rely on a handful of blockbuster films that keep them afloat, [8] movies such as Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean and Avatar. [9] 
            Lesson Summary
                Early motion picture technology was first introduced to a mass audience through Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope in 1891.
                It wasn’t until the Lumière brothers released the Cinématographe in 1895, that motion pictures were projected for public audience viewing. 
                Film established itself as a popular form of entertainment in the United States, with Nickelodeon theaters in the 1910s.
                By 1915 most of the major film studios had moved to Hollywood in California, because of cheaper land and better outdoor filming conditions.
                D.W. Griffith’s silent film 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), presented a racial perspective on the U.S. Civil War and its aftermath and caused much controversy.
                The release of 'The Jazz Singer' in 1927 marked the birth of the talking film. By 1930, silent films were a thing of the past. 
                Technicolor emerged in film in the 1930s and found early success with movies such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind.
                The majority of films would continue to be made in black and white, until the late 1950s.
                    During the Golden Age of Hollywood (1920s - 1960s), the major studios controlled all aspects of the movie industry, from production to distribution and the movie theaters themselves. The audience numbers that regularly attended movie theaters during this period, has not been surpassed.
                    During World War II, film production was monitored by the government and tended to promote a patriotic, pro-war sentiment.
                    After World War II, the power of the studio system declined, as a result of antitrust legislation and the invention of television.
                    In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rise in films that celebrated the emerging youth culture and the rejection of conservatism, with films such as Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Easy Rider. This movement also encouraged looser attitudes towards sexuality and violence in film. 
                    After the failure of the Vietnam War (1975), films began to reflect a more ambivalent attitude toward war.
                    The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the blockbuster movie and bigger advertising budgets, with films such as Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather.
                    A film’s performance at the box office is often directly related to the marketing and advertising budget that promotes it.
                    The widespread use of the VCR in households in the 1980s, reduced movie theater attendance, but opened up a new mass market of home movie viewers.
                        Improvements in computer animation and digital effects in the 1990s, led to the success of films such as The Matrix, Jurassic Park and the first fully computer-animated film 'Toy Story'.
                        Movies and culture tend to have a symbiotic relationship, i.e. both reflect and influence each other. 
                        Movies are a powerful medium and audiences can adopt the attitudes and styles of the characters they watch on screen. 
                        Because of the high marketing and production costs, the major film studios have increasingly come to rely on blockbuster films to keep themselves profitable.
                        Independent films became more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, in part because they represented a break from the predictable material released by the big studios.
                        The VCR was replaced by DVDs in the late 1990s and by the Blu-ray Disc in the 2000s, when digital video sales and renta

                            CONCEPT
                            In November 2007, more than 12,000 film, television and radio writers working in the United States, went on strike for fairer pay. 
                            Lasting for more than 3 months, the strike disrupted many hit shows in 2008 and cost the Los Angeles economy $2.5 billion. [1] 

                            While production for many television shows was on hiatus, several industry executives were thinking of new ways to reach their audience. Declaring that it was “time to change the face of Show Business as we know it,” Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator, Joss Whedon started writing a three-part musical series, specifically designed to be released on the Internet.

Shortly after the free viewing, the tragicomic musical was made available for purchase on iTunes, where it reached No. 1 on the video chart, totaling 2.2 million downloads per week. The soundtrack was also released via iTunes, obtaining the No. 1 spot on the first day of its release and debuting at No. 39 on the 'Billboard 200' chart. 

                        Capitalizing on the musical’s online success, Whedon authorized the creation of a DVD, which was released exclusively through Amazon.com on December 19, 2008. It reached the No. 3 position on Amazon’s movie and television sales. 
                        Television's Influence
                        IMPACTS
                        Since replacing radio as the most popular mass medium in the 1950s, television has played such an integral role in modern life that, for some, it is difficult to imagine being without it. 
                        Both reflecting and shaping cultural values, television has at times been criticized for its alleged negative influences on children and young people and at other times lauded for its ability to create a common experience for all its viewers.

                        SYSTEM
                        CRT
                        SCANNER
                        Inventors conceived of the idea of television long before the technology to create it had appeared. Early pioneers speculated that if audio waves could be separated from the electromagnetic spectrum to create radio, so too television waves could be separated to transmit visual images. 
                        As early as 1876, Boston civil servant George Carey envisioned a complete television system and submitted drawings for a “selenium camera”, that would enable people to “see by electricity” a year later. [3]
                        In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used both the CRT and the mechanical scanner system, in an experimental system. With the CRT in the receiver, he used focused electron beams to display images, transmitting crude geometrical patterns onto a screen. The mechanical disk system was used as a camera, creating a primitive television system.

                        LIMITATIONS
                        From early experiments with visual transmissions, two types of television systems came into existence: mechanical television and electronic television. 
                        Mechanical television developed out of Nipkow’s disk system and was pioneered by British inventor John Logie Baird. In 1926, Baird gave the world’s first public demonstration of a television system, at Selfridge’s department store in London. 
                        At the same time Baird was developing the mechanical model, other inventors were working on an electronic television system based on the CRT. While working on his father’s farm, Idaho teenager Philo Farnsworth realized that an electronic beam could scan a picture in horizontal lines, reproducing the image almost instantaneously. 
                        Electronic Television
                        TRANSMISSION
                        In 1927, Farnsworth transmitted the first all-electronic television picture, by rotating a single straight line scratched onto a square piece of painted glass, by 90 degrees.

                        Farnsworth barely profited from his invention. During World War II, the government suspended sales of television sets and by the time the war ended, Farnsworth’s original patents were close to expiring.
                        However, following the war, many of his key patents were modified by RCA and were widely applied in broadcasting, to improv

                        PULLED
                        When television was in its infancy, producers modeled the new medium on radio. Popular radio shows such as police drama 'Dragnet' and western cowboy series 'Gunsmoke', were adapted for television. 
                        New television shows were sponsored by single advertisers, just as radio shows had been. Television was dominated by three major networks—NBC, ABC and CBS. These networks accounted for more than 95 percent of all prime-time viewing, until the late 1970s. 

                        Today, the television industry is far more complex. Programs are sponsored by multiple advertisers and programming is controlled by major media conglomerates. The three major networks no longer dominate the airwaves, but instead share their viewers with numerous cable channels. Several factors account for these trends within the industry, including technological developments, government regulations and the creation of new network
                        Since its inception as an integral part of American life in the 1950s, television has both reflected and nurtured cultural mores and values. 
                        The escapist dramas of the 1960s, consciously avoided controversial issues and glossed over life’s harsher realities, in favor of an idealized portrayal of life.

                        DATA
                        The experience of watching television is rapidly changing with the progression of technology. No longer restricted to a limited number of channels on network television, or even to a television schedule, viewers are now able to watch exactly what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.
                        Non-television delivery systems such as the Internet, enables viewers to download traditional television shows onto a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone and this is changing the way people watch television. 
                        Meanwhile, cable and satellite providers are enabling viewers to purchase television shows to watch at their convenience, through the use of video-on-demand services. This has changed the concept of prime-time viewing.
                        Lesson Summary
                            Two key technological developments in the late 1800s played a vital role in the evolution of television: the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk. 
                            The cathode ray tube, invented by German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897, was the forerunner of the television picture tube. It had a florescent screen that emitted a visible light (in the form of images) when struck by a beam of electrons. 
                            The scanning disk, invented by German inventor Paul Nipkow, was a large, flat metal disk that could be used as a rotating camera. It served as the foundation for experiments on the transmission of visual images for several decades.
                            Out of the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk, two types of primitive television systems evolved: mechanical systems and electronic systems. 
                            Mechanical television systems had several technical disadvantages: low resolution caused fuzzy images and the use of a spinning disk limited the number of new pictures that could be seen per second, resulting in excessive flickering. 
                            By 1939, all mechanical television broadcasts in the United States had been replaced by electronic broadcasts.
                            Early televisions were expensive and the technology was slow to catch on, as development was delayed during World War II. 
                                Following the Second World War, television rapidly replaced radio as the new main form of mass communication.
                                During the “golden age” of television in the 1950s, television moved away from radio formats and began developing new types of shows, including the magazine-style variety show and the television spectacular.
                                Color television gained popularity in the late 1960s and began to replace black-and-white television in the 1970s. 
                                Cable television, initially developed in the 1940s to cater to viewers in rural areas, switched its focus from local to national broadcasts, offering a variety of channels. 
                                In 2009, the traditional analog system, which had been in place for 60 years, was replaced with digital television, giving viewers a higher-quality picture and freeing up frequency space. 
                                In 2010, nearly half of American viewers used high-definition television, which offers a crystal-clear picture, with wide-screen, to provide a "cinematic experience" at home.
                                Television has reflected changing cultural values, since it first gained popularity, following the Second World War.
                                During the 1950s, most programs ignored current events and political issues, in favor of family-friendly domestic comedies, featuring mainly white suburban middle-class families.

                                    Entrepreneurship is an essential driver of economic development. It is also the process of planning, launching and running a new business with the motive of earning profit and creating wealth
                                    Entrepreneurship is important because it boosts economic growth by introducing innovative technologies, products and services
                                    Increased competition from entrepreneurs challenges and also motivates the established companies to become more competitive and to renew and review their own methods of doing. So the economy benefits because newer products and newer services are brought in by the entrepreneurs
                                    There are four different types of Entrepreneurs and they are: Innovative Entrepreneurs, Replicative Entrepreneurs, Opportunity Entrepreneurs and, Necessity Entrepreneurs

                                    Entrepreneurs take risks to establish businesses, but not always based on new technologies. While Start-up founders take risks to establish businesses almost always based on a new technology

                                        Entrepreneurs have major characteristics that tell them apart from manager and those characteristics are: they have got lots of confidence in our own technical and managerial competencies which makes them to see a market opportunity or a product opportunity where other people do not see same
                                        Entrepreneurship is important to the economy because it creates great economic wealth and creates huge employment
                                        The triggers of the quest for entrepreneurship are: a dislike for the paid job system, a revulsion in working for someone else's satisfaction, a firm conviction in one's technical and managerial competencies, etc
                                        The three aspects to an entrepreneur are: they have a purpose, they are creative and they have passion for their vocation
                                        Entrepreneurs create an expanding role of entrepreneurship because they are inventors and they are builders of a nation's economy
                                        Entrepreneurial discovery is a combination of: intrinsic entrepreneurial personality, acquired entrepreneurial experience, organizational and environmental expectations
                                        Assessment of the intrinsic entrepreneurial personality can be achieved to a reasonable degree with personality tests and assessment
                                        There are quite a number of entrepreneurial personality assessment tests and here are a few: psychometric tools, the more sophisticated tests such as Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), BDC etc

                Lesson Summary
                Below you will find key information covered in this module:

                    Criminology includes studying all aspects of crime and law enforcement—criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, and capture and punishment. 
                    Crime is an act or omission in violation of a law committed without defence or justification. The Revised Penal Code (RPC) of Reyes (2018) states that crime is committed not only by malice (dolo) but also by means of fault (culpa). There is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent. There is fault when the wrongful act result from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill
                    The criminal profile describes the likely social and mental characteristics of the criminal. Victimology is a field with a less generally agreed-upon theoretical framework or research paradigm than many longer-established disciplines. 
                     Various crimes exist, including crimes against persons, victimless crimes, violent crimes, and white-collar crimes. Criminology is the study of crime and criminal behaviour, informed by principles of sociology and other non-legal fields, including psychology, economics, statistics, and anthropology.
                    The roots of criminology trace back to a movement to reform criminal justice and penal systems more than 200 years ago. The first collection and use of crime statistics in the 19th century then Basics of Criminal Investigation

                        Lesson Summary
                        Key points covered in this module are:
                            The significant changes in force projection did not occur until the nineteenth century, a change in which motivation and technology played a key role.
                            The age of cavalry was the age of poor infantry, and it was a political, not a technological, phenomenon.
                            It is hard to separate military experience from war thinking because the past is a source of examples and ideas.
                            The 7th century saw the birth of Islam, which brought with it a massive conquest effort.

                            During the world wars, trench warfare was transferred by a gradual evolution of artillery and infantry tactics, integrating new technology effectively.
                            The prime functions of aircraft were reconnaissance and artillery spotting-giving army gunners feedback on where their shells had landed.
                            World War I and II saw progress in wired and wireless communications technology.

                            The development of weaponry and other technology products affected warfare and its course profoundly and continuously.
                            The most significant single element in maintaining high morale is leadership.

                            Fear is managed in combat by decisive and capable leadership.
                            Lesson Summary
                            Tools of war have been instrumental in conquests, invasions, and enslavement throughout history, but they have also been used to check evil and maintain peace.
                            Military Weaponry and Aviation:
                                Weapons have evolved to become both more lethal and complex.
                                A great part of technology development of weaponry has taken part in the last two centuries, especially the twentieth century.
                                From the beginning of World War I, aircraft were used to drop bombs or heavy steel darts on enemy forces.
                                The bomber aircraft blurred the lines between combatants and non-combatants.
                            British Military History:
                                Aden became a functional coaling station for the Royal Navy and merchant vessels on passage to the Far East.
                                British policy was to preserve Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and continued Russian expansion in central Asia.
                                Britain's maritime involvement in the Far East had hitherto centred upon the Indian Ocean. Understanding Veterans' Mental Health

                    Lesson Summary
                        The United States has approximately 3.5 million military personnel comprised of various active duty, reserve, and Department of Defense civilian personnel.
                        The Army is the largest service branch with nearly 500,000 members followed by the Navy, Air Force, and Marines.
                        According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States has approximately 20 million veterans.
                        Military personnel face the full range of traumatic events experienced by civilians as well as events unique to military service.
                        Common traumatic events associated with military service include coming across a dead body unexpectedly and witnessing the injury or death of another person.
                        Military sexual trauma is defined as “sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment that occurred while the victim was in the military”.
                        Any deployment, even those to non-combat areas, is a significant event that can disrupt the lives of the service member and their family. 
                        A successful reintegration following a long or especially difficult deployment requires the entire family. 
                        Despite the benefits of seeking early mental health care, many of the mental health resources available to veterans remain vastly underutilized.
                        To ensure a standardized approach to mental health care throughout the entire VA system, the VA has established guidelines as to the types of mental health services that VA hospitals and clinics must offer to veterans and their families.

                    For many of us, the prospect of nuclear warfare raises fears of the end of life as we know it.

                    You may be surprised to learn that hundreds of nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmo
                    e Race for the First Atomic Bomb
                    The first nuclear bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. The project was launched in response to fears that the Nazis might try to construct an atom bomb after a major research breakthrough in 1938.

                    'Father' of the Atomic Bomb
                    German scientists Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann and Lise Meitner had discovered how to bombard uranium with neutrons, causing it to break up and release vast amounts of energy. The process is called splitting the atom, or nuclear fission. The trio received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966 for their discovery.

                    The First Test
                    On July 16, 1945, under President Truman, the Americans successfully detonated the first atomic bomb, in the Trinity Test. Those present watched in awe as an explosion equivalent to about 21,000 tons of the explosive TNT created a mushroom cloud that was over 3,000 feet wide and soared 40,000 feet in the sky.

                    Just one month later, the USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, forcing an end to World War II. 
                    We will look at that in more detail later.
                    The Arms Race
                    In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a burgeoning arms race saw the USA and USSR develop and test new types of bombs, with the USA focusing on methods of delivery and the Soviet Union aiming for maximum size or ‘yield’.
                    In the ensuing years, the UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also began to develop nuclear arsenals.

                    Opt Outs
                    In 1970, after a period of escalation, the USA, USSR and UK, France and China signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT or Non-Proliferation Treaty), along with 38 other countries.
                    Atmospheric Tests
                    With so many countries developing nuclear weapons, you have probably already been exposed to fallout from  weapons tests in your lifetime, especially if you live in the northern hemisphere. Over 500 missiles have exploded above ground and in the skies above our heads.
                    UN: Radioactive Materials 'Everywhere'
                    In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reported to the General Assembly that: “The main man-made contribution to the exposure of the world's population has come from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, from 1945 to 1980. Each nuclear test resulted in the unrestrained release into the environment of substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface.”

                    Dangers Not Recognized
                    Annual Radiation Doses LowThe UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reported that levels of contamination had continued to drop since testing ended. “The average annual doses are 10% higher in the northern hemisphere, where most of the testing took place, and lower in the southern hemisphere. Although there was considerable concern at the time of testing, the annual doses remained relatively low, reaching at most about 7% of the background level from natural radiation sources.”
                    Monitoring ShortfallsWhile atmospheric tests were carried out above ground, an estimated 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990, according to UNSCEAR. Particularly during the early years, from 1945 to 1960, local populations that were

                    The events on the previous page chart the rapid transition of physics research from the blackboard to the test site. Most of the explosions yielded 15 to 23 kilotons, or the equivalent of 23,000 tons of TNT.
                    The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki yielded approximately 15 and 21 kilotons respectively. The death tolls on the previous page are a conservative estimate as tragically, the exact number of deaths has never been established.

                    The arms race began when the USSR detonated its first nuclear explosive in 1949 at the Semipalatinsk test site in modern-day Kazakhstan. Code-named RDS-1, the device had a yield of 22 kilotons and the fallout was detected by the USA.

                    1963: As a consequence of Tsar Bomba, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain on August 5. It prohibits testing in the atmosphere, in outer space, under water, or in any area within a state’s territory that would cause ‘radioactive debris’ to fall outside the state's territory. There are now 126 parties to the PNTBT.
                    Since 1980, all nuclear tests have been conducted underground.
                    Current Nuclear Arms Treaties
                    Over the decades a number of treaties have been agreed upon, which attempt to ensure transparency and accountability worldwide. The most significant include:

                        Partial Ban: As mentioned, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banned testing in the atmosphere, outerspace, underwater or anywhere that might contaminate a neighboring country.
                        Comprehensive Ban: The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996 bans all nuclear explosions, for civilian or military purposes, however, it has yet to be enforced.
                        New START: A third arrangement is the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. New START came into force on February 5, 2011, and lasts until February 4, 2026. It imposes limits on both countries so long as the treaty remains in force.
                        JCPOA for Iran: Finally, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an agreement between Iran and China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the USA dated July 14, 2015. It allows for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran’s nuclear capability. On May 30, 2022, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to credibly explain the presence of altered uranium at Turquzabad, Varamin and ‘Marivan’, or the location(s) of the nuclear material that was moved from Turquzabad in 2018. Further, nuclear activities and nuclear material used at Lavisan-Shian were not declared as required under the Compreh
                        What Causes a Nuclear Explosion?
                        About AtomsAll matter is made up of atoms - minute structures that combine a mix of three particles called protons (which have a positive electric charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge). 
                        Each atom has a nucleus at its center, where the neutrons and protons are close together.
                        Splitting the Atom
                        Breaking a nucleus by bombarding it with neutrons causes the amount of energy associated with explosives to be released.
                        Fission and Fusion
                        Nuclear explosions are divided into two types. In both instances, some sort of conventional explosive is needed to trigger the initial reaction.
                        Nuclear Fission
                        Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Not all elements lend themselves to the process. The most commonly used isotope is uranium-235. This is because uranium ore (pictured) occurs naturally in the earth and in seawater and can go through an ‘enriching’ process to become fissionable U-235.
                        Plutonium-239, uranium-233, and thorium-232 may also be used. These isotopes are variations of the element with different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Plutonium is a byproduct of nuclear fission and can be reprocessed for use more easily than uranium can be enriched, however, it is extremely radioactive. Needless to say, both enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium are complex and expensive procedures.

                    What Impact Would a Nuclear Explosion Have?
                    Many factors influence the severity of the damage caused by an explosion - the materials used in the weapon, the size of it, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and what the weather is like at the time. These factors also affect the resulting shockwave, thermal radiation, light and radioactivity, therefore it is difficult to generalize about the impact of any given explosion.

                    The only certainty is that those closest to the explosion are most at risk from the intense heat of the fireball, the powerful shockwave created by the blast, and ionizing radiation, but the chances of survival increase rapidly the further you are from ground zer

                    The Emergency Response
                    In the event of a blast, emergency planners would divide the area around a blast site into Severe, Moderate and Light Damage zones. The following information, courtesy of the USDHHS Radiation Emergency Medical Management, describes what emergency workers might expect as they approach from the Light Damage Zone and proceed towards ground zero:
                    Light Damage (LD) Zone
                    Litter and Rubble
                    Blast Overpressures
                    Damage is caused by shocks, similar to those produced by a thunderclap or a sonic boom, but with much more force. 


                    Although some windows may be broken over 10 miles (16 km) away, the injury associated with flying glass will generally occur at overpressures above 0.5 psi. 


                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about 3 miles (4.8 km) from ground zero for a 10 KT nuclear explosion. The damage in this area will be highly variable as shock waves rebound multiple times off of buildings, the terrain, and even the atmosphere.
                    The Moderate Damage Zone
                    Responders may expect they are transitioning into the MD zone when building damage becomes substantial.
                    Structural Damage
                    Street Clearing
                    Hazards
                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about one mile (1.6 km) from ground zero for a 10KT nuclear explosion. The determination is made by ground-level and/or overhead imagery.


                    Observations in the MD zone include significant structural damage, blown-out building interiors, blown-down utility lines, overturned automobiles, caved roofs, some collapsed buildings, and fires. Some telephone poles and street light poles will also be blown over.

                    Sturdier buildings (e.g., reinforced concrete) will remain standing, lighter commercial and multi-unit residential buildings may be fallen or structurally unstable, and many wood-frame houses will be destroyed
                    The Severe Damage Zone
                    Few Survivors
                    Rubble
                    Hiroshima
                    Few, if any, buildings are expected to be structurally sound or even standing in the Severe Damage (SD) zone, and very few people would survive.


                    However, some people protected within stable structures (e.g., subterranean parking garages or subway tunnels) at the time of the explosion may survive the initial blast.


                    Very high radiation levels from prompt and residual origin and other hazards are expected in the SD zone, significantly increasing risks to survivors and responders. Responders should enter this zone with great caution, only to rescue known survivors.
                    Predictions Based on Best Guesses
                    The previous pages consider the degrees of damage from a 10-kiloton explosion, however, as we have already stated, everything from the position of a device when it is detonated to the weather on the day can have a bearing on the outcome.
                    Yields
                    Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs are a great deal more destructive, or give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs. While many weapons tests have been carried out over the years, governments have been loath to reveal full details due to military sensitivities. The overall yield of explosions has been documented, however, the amount of fusion and fission yields from each test remain unknown, making it difficult for scientists to predict the degree of hazard posed by future explosions.
                    Remote TestsFurthermore, the sites of all the tests carried out over the years have been oceans or deserts, which limit the creation of fires and smoke, and therefore give a less than accurate portrayal of the impact of an explosion in the sort of urban setting that might be targeted in a military attack

Tactical or nonstrategic weapons are regarded as ‘battle’ weapons, with a shorter range and lower yield than ‘strategic’ or long-range weapons, which are more powerful and are designed to attack another country. Tactical weapons do not appear to be included in the New START treaty between the USA and the USSR. See https://www.state.gov/new-start/ for details.

                    'Cannot Be Won'
                    In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.  In June 2022, tensions rose over Russian fears that Ukraine's allies in the EU might supply it with nuclear weapons following the Russian invasion.
                    Nuclear Tests Underground
                    We have seen that the place where an explosion happens - in the atmosphere or on the ground - has an impact on the degree of devastation caused. Devices that explode in the air create less fallout than those on the ground. But what do we know of the impact of an explosion underground or underwater?
                    In the case of an explosion at ground level, radioactive fallout is a much more pressing danger than it is in the case of an atmospheric or air explosion, as the blast causes much dirt and debris to be sucked up from the ground and irradiated.
                    Underground Tests
                    Between the year of 1963 when the Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, until 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed, the world’s major nuclear powers tested hundreds of weapons underground. In fact, the USA alone performed 815 underground tests over the decades, mainly at the Nevada Test Site (pictured).

                    Canniken Test


                    According to the Atomic Heritage Foundation (AHF), the largest underground US nuclear explosion was the Cannikin test on Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian islands of Alaska. 
                    This controversial episode spawned the formation of the Greenpeace environmental protest group, however, despite legal battles that went to the US Supreme Court, the detonation went ahead on the orders of President Richard Nixon, on November 6, 1971.

                    o Nuclear Tests Trigger Earthquakes?
                    The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation is often compared to or measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, that does not necessarily mean that the explosion has caused an earthquake. For instance, the Cannikin test in Alaska released energy equivalent to a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, however, it did not trigger any earthquakes in the seismically active Aleutian Islands.

                    The seismic waves produced by underground nuclear explosions have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes. 

                    The US Geological Survey acknowledges that nuclear explosions may cause earthquakes, however, these are much smaller than the explosion, and the aftershock sequence produces fewer and smaller aftershocks than a similar size earthquake. The range of a possible earthquake triggered by an explosion is limited to a few tens of kilometers.
                    Hiroshima and Nagasaki
                    There have been numerous weapons tests and many serious accidents in which radioactive material was leaked, however, there remain just two occasions when nuclear bombs were deliberately unleashed in an act of war. The fact that both targets were urban areas gives a different perspective on the consequences of a nuclear explosion from tests in unpopulated areas.
                    The former Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall was one of the few buildings to survive the bombing of Hiroshima. It’s now famous as the A-Bomb Dome, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.

                    Lesson Summary
                    The main points you have learned from this module are as follows:

                        Nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmosphere.
                        German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered how to split the atom by bombarding uranium with neutrons in a process called nuclear fission, in 1938.
                        The race to build the first nuclear weapon began when Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt about their concerns that the Nazis might weaponize Hahn and Strassman’s discovery.
                        The first atomic bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. It was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity Test and its 21 kiloton yield created a mushroom cloud over 3,000 feet wide and 40,000 feet high.
                        The USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945, bringing an end to World War II.
                        The Arms Race began in the late 1940s and early 1950s between the USA and USSR. The UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also developed nuclear arsenals. In 1970, all five countries signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
                        Other nuclear powers include Pakistan (1972), India (1974), Israel and North Korea. South Africa, Ukraine and Uzbekistan dismantled their nuclear arsenals.
                        Lesson Summary
                            In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation said that from 1945 to 1980, nuclear tests had released ‘substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface’.
                            The USA and the USSR tested thermonuclear weapons in 1952-3, spreading fallout worldwide. In 1958 the US Food and Drug Administration reported that tea harvests from 1956 and 1957 had 30 times more radioactive isotope strontium-90 than pre-1945 samples.
                            In October 1963, after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USA, the UK and the USSR signed a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; France and China continued atmospheric tests.
                            Atmospheric tests ceased in 1980 after 543 tests caused radionuclides, particularly strontium-90 and cesium-137 to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere.
                            Approximately 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990.
                            The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was opened for signatures in 1996, however, it has not been enforced yet.
                            According to the geomapping company Esri UK , there have been 2,624 nuclear detonations across the world since 1945.
                            The sites of all the tests ca
                            Lesson Summary
                                Modern weapons are classified as either ‘tactical’ or ‘nonstrategic’ nuclear (battle) weapons or as ‘strategic’ or ‘long range’ weapons designed to attack another country.
                                In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.
                                Many factors influence the destructive capacity of a nuclear explosion - the materials used in the weapon, its size, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and the weather.
                                In the case of a 10 kiloton explosion, the Severe Damage Zone is estimated at about a half-mile radius (0.8km); the Moderate Damage Zone would be about one mile, or 1.6km; the Light Damage Zone is likely to extend about 3 miles or 4.8km from ground zero.
                                Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Thermonuclear or Hydrogen bombs use fission for the initial explosion followed by nuclear fusion where further energy is released as two nuclei are fused to become one. Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs.
                                Thermal Radiation consists of an initial rapid burst of ultraviolet radiation, followed by a second, more sustained pulse. It reaches temperatures of up to 100 million degrees centigrade, causing combustible materials to ignite. Smoke or clouds can mitigate this risk.

                            Lesson Summary
                                The strength of the blast is measured by the pound per square inch (psi) of pressure above the normal atmospheric amount. The blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound. In an atmospheric explosion, the first and second blast waves merge to form a Mach Stem.
                                1963’s Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, so nuclear powers tested their weapons underground.
                                The first underground test took place at the Nevada test site in the USA in 1951 while the US conducted its last nuclear test, codenamed Divider, at an underground facility in Nevada on September 23, 1992. It carried out 815 underground tests. In 1996 the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty officially ended all testing. 
                                The largest underground US nuclear explosion was the Cannikin test on Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, on November 6, 1971. The shock registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. Wildlife was badly affected locally but there was no tsunami and almost no radioactivity. Seafood is safe for human consumption.
                                The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation may be measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, the seismic waves have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes.
                                In 1969, research at the Nevada Test Site found the tests did not trigger earthquakes in earthquake-prone California.

                        Introduction
                        Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the landscape of contemporary mental health and criminology. As society grapples with increasing challenges at the intersection of mental health and violent behavior, it is crucial for professionals navigating these terrains to be deeply informed, both theoretically and pragmatically.
                        This course delves into the pertinence of understanding this complex interplay, beginning with an exploration of the key findings from the Bureau of Justice Report - Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement from 2011. Armed with this data-driven context, participants will transition into mastering basic initial screening techniques, subsequently diving deep into the intricate relationships between various mental health disorders and the potential for violent behavior.
                        Anchored by robust guiding studies, an exploration into the nuances of psychopathy, and a meticulous understanding of homicide typology, the course offers a comprehensive look into the subject. Moreover, as firearms remain a significant factor in the equation, emphasis on promoting firearm safety with patients becomes paramount, a theme accentuated by scrutinizing firearm availability statistics. By the culmination of this course, participants will possess a sophisticated, multidimensional grasp of Homicide Risk Evaluation and its intrinsic tie to Firearm Safety
                        The Relevance
                        Among U.S. citizens, homicide is still the second leading cause of death (tied with suicide) between the ages of 1-24 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) and between the third to fifth leading cause of death between the ages of 25-44 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) depending on how you split up the age range (25-44 vs. 25-34). The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations; with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.
                        Shift in Trend
                        The U.S. Annual Homicide Rate
                        Gun-Related Homicides in the U.S.
                        Although violent crime rates fell over 50% from 1993 to 2015 (e.g., Gramlich, 2017), the more than two-decade downward trend for violent crime in the U.S. appears to be shifting and rates have been rising in recent years. For example, an estimated 14,827 persons were murdered in the U.S. in 2012 (FBI 1, 2012); a number that while not including “justifiable” homicide, represents a slightly higher homicide rate than the 2011 rate of 4.7 homicides per 100,000 persons that was the lowest homicide rate since 1963 (Smith & Cooper, 2013).
                        The Relevance (Contd)
                        In comparison to other high-income nations, overall, Americans are:

                            Seven times more likely to be violently killed
                            Twenty-five times more likely to be violently killed with a gun
                            Six times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun
                            Eight times more likely to commit suicide using a gun
                            Ten times more likely to die from a firearm death overall (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).

                        In 2014, the overall rate of death by firearms in the United States was 10.3 per 100,000 people — the same as for death by motor vehicles — with suicides accounting for roughly two out of every three gun-related deaths. 
                        To illustrate the recent upward trend consider that in the first 200 days of 2014, there were 6,206 gun deaths on record, not counting suicides.

                        From 2002 to 2011, young adults ages 18 to 24 had the highest homicide rate of any age group and experienced the greatest rate decline (down 22%) over the 10 years, from 15.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 11.9 in 2011.	The rate of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 49% from 1992 to 2011, while the percentage of homicide victims killed by a firearm (67%) remained stable.
                        Large cities with 100,000 or more residents experienced the largest decline (23%) in homicide rates from 2002 to 2011, compared to communities with less than 100,000 residents.	From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide incidents involved a single victim. In 2011, 66% of homicides with a single victim involved a firearm, compared to 79% of homicide incidents with multiple victims.

                        What Do Clinicians Need to Understand
                        Assessments, Screenings and Guidelines for Clinicians
                        America’s unique gun culture has dire consequences. The U.S. has the most firearms per capita in the world. Despite having only half the population of the other 22 high-income nations combined, data suggests that the U.S. accounts for 82% of all firearm deaths globally, and that the U.S. accounts for 90% of all women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, and 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years who were killed by firearms worldwide (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016). Moreover, while the overall suicide rate in the U.S. is on par with other high-income nations, the gun suicide rate in America is eight times higher (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).
                        senting a 12% surge in gun deaths.
                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques
                        When patients admit to homicidal ideation, mental health providers ask the following questions to assess risk (Pinard & Pagani, 2001):

                            Is there an identifiable victim - a specific person(s) or a specific location, such as an office building?
                            Does the patient have a plan? Is the plan rational and lethal? Has there been any progression in planning?
                            Does he or she have access to the intended weapon?
                            Is the victim available, e.g. does the patient have access to him or her?
                            Has the patient taken steps to practice or prepare? For example, if the patient fantasizes about releasing a round of bullets at his previous place of work, has he engaged in any preliminary behaviors such as stalking, obtaining worker schedules, or creating a drawing of the building layout?
                            What, if anything, stops the patient from acting on his or her violent thoughts?

                        Questions like these can help determine if a patient needs to be evaluated in the inpatient setting or if the evaluation can be safely conducted in the outpatient setting.
                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques (Contd)
                        Also helpful in evaluating dangerousness are questions that address risk factors for violent behavior (Derefinko et al., 2011; Pinard & Pagani, 2001), such as:

                            Does the patient have a history of violent behavior toward people or animals? Does the patient have a criminal record?
                            Does the patient display problems with impulse control?
                            Has the patient ever been diagnosed with Axis I or Axis II disorders? If so, what disorder(s)?
                            If the patient is prescribed psychopharmacological medications, what are they? Has he or she been taking the medications as prescribed?
                            Is the patient abusing alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescribed medications?
                            If the patient receives services from a primary care physician or psychiatrist, when was he or she last seen?
                            What if any sources or recent events have occurred that might lead to major disappointment or anger?

                        Violent sprees are often preceded by a trigger related to losses or perceived rejections, such as a breakup, being fired from a job, or being rejected for admission into a college or the military (Pinard & Pagani, 2001).
                        Adjunct consultation with other health providers, such as the patient’s primary care physician, will often provide valuable information about the patient’s prescribed medications, adherence to medications, psychiatric history, medical problems, and family history.
                        Guidelines for Clinicians
                        Reasons for Psychiatric Evaluation
                        A history of substance abuse, head injury, or a mental health disorder with the potential for psychotic thinking (e.g. mania, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, delusional disorder, and dementia) may be associated with detriments in self-control and should therefore be considered a strong indicator for immediate psychiatric evaluation. In addition, when a patient has made a direct threat of intent to harm, psychiatric evaluation should be obtained. Forced psychiatric evaluation raises issues related to morality (Bennett et al. 1993) and civil liberties (Testa & West, 2010).

                            Given the disparities in homicide rates across different demographic groups, how can healthcare professionals ensure they approach these statistics without bias, and provide equitable care and assessment for all patients, regardless of their demographic background?
                            How can mental health professionals effectively balance the need for safety precautions and risk assessments with maintaining trust and therapeutic rapport with their patients, especially when discussing topics as sensitive as violent ideation and firearm accessibility?
                            Considering the U.S. gun culture and the alarming statistics surrounding firearm deaths, how might healthcare professionals address the topic of firearm safety in therapeutic settings without triggering defensiveness or resistance, and promote a dialogue that prioritizes the well-being of the patient and the community?

                        Mental Health and Risk for Violent Behavior
                        Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. This finding is robust even when other risk factors are controlled, such as being male, growing up in a violent neighborhood, and being less educated (Link et al., 1992; Swanson et al., 1990).
                        Personality Disorders
                        Psychological disorders are quite common among violent individuals, especially Cluster B Personality Disorders: Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). 
                        While in most cases the suspicions of individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) provoke only insults and lawsuits, in a small number of cases they can foment violence (Tardiff, 2001). The key DSM 5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for these disorders are summarized in the page titled–Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence.
                        Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence
                        Antisocial Personality Disorder
                        Thrill-seeking, reckless, impulsive, deceitful, irritable, aggressive, irresponsible, violates the law, lacks remorse, and has a history of violence toward animals and/or people
                        Narcissistic Personality Disorder
                        Histrionic Personality Disorder
                        Borderline Personality Disorder
                        Paranoid Personality Disorder

                        Disturbances of Thought
                        Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence (Contd)
                        Dangerous Hallucinations 
                        Not all hallucinations carry the same risk for violence; some types of hallucinations are associated with a greater risk. Auditory “command” hallucinations that tell the patient to hurt him/herself or hurt another are significantly associated with potential future violence (Barrowcliff & Haddock, 2010). Visual hallucinations can also be dangerous.

                        Gellerman and Suddath (2005) reviewed court decisions on the matter and concluded “…the courts considered the expression of violent fantasies to be an indication that the patients were potentially dangerous, particularly in the context of having a history of violent or threatening behavior (p. 486).” To clarify, providers were not typically held responsible for failing in the duty to warn in the case of violent fantasy without a history of violence. There were some exceptions.

                        The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was tasked with assembling the current knowledge about violent risk assessment and creating an actuarial model that could successfully predict violence and be developed into a computer-based decision tree for practitioners. 
                        The MacArthur team interviewed male and female patients (N = 1,136) between the ages of 18 and 40 during an acute civil inpatient hospitalization who had a chart diagnosis of thought or affective disorder, substance abuse, or personality disorder. 
                        Participants were interviewed at ten-week intervals for one-year post-discharge to evaluate factors related to risk for violence (The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005)1

                        Findings: The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study
                        The team’s findings about risk factors for violence are highlighted as follows:
                        Gender: Violence by Men Vs. Violence by Women
                        Men were somewhat more likely than women to be violent, but the difference was not large. Violence by women was more likely than violence by men to be directed against family members and to occur at home, and less likely to result in medical treatment or arrest.

                        The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree
                        These findings from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study led to the development of the measure, The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree (ICT; The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005). The ICT will be discussed in more detail when we turn our discussion to assessment measures.
                        Study on Mental Illness and Violence
                        Premorbid and Contemporaneous Clinical Factors
                        Example of Two Patients
                        Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Van Dorn et al. (2012) conducted a large two-wave study of mental illness and violence. 
                        They concluded, “...there is a statistically significant, yet modest relationship between recent serious mental illness (SMI) (within 12 months) and violence, and a stronger relationship between SMI with substance use disorder and violence. 
                        Extrapolating from Van Dorn et al.’s work, it may be that to date the prediction of violence in clinical settings has failed largely due to the complexity of the predictive equation.
                        Evaluating the Potential for Violent Behaviour
                        Litwach et al. (2006) note that too little research has been conducted on psychiatric patients hospitalized for violent behavior, but they do provide a list of risk factors for violent behavior based on empirical studies currently available. This list serves as a good summary guide for mental health providers when evaluating a patient’s potential for dangerous behavior (p 503). According to their review, Litwach et al. (2006) suggest the most important risk factors to attend to include:

                            Active psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, plus a history of violence or current hostile attitudes
                            The presence of delusional beliefs about significant others and specific personal targets, especially that a significant other has been replaced by an imposter
                            Severe and chronic self-destructiveness
                            Command hallucinations to commit violence when the hallucinated voice is identified; when there is also a delusion related to the hallucination; or when the content of the hallucination includes reference to self-harm
                            Erotomania with multiple delusional objects and a history of serious antisocial behavior unrelated to delusions
                            Recent and currently active narcissistic injury; isolation of affect or grossly inappropriate affect; threatening or provocative behavior, which is usually minimized by the patient; and the availability of a weapon.

                        Psychopathy and Homicide Typology
                        Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. It is worth making a clear clinical distinction between the two. Let’s begin with psychopathy and then contrast it with homicide typology.

                        Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised
                        Psychopathy, the first personality disorder listed in the DSM, was later subsumed by the current Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD). Curiously, many forensic specialists have retained the use of the term psychopathy for those whose affect and behavior suggest a level of deviance beyond that of the typical Antisocial individual. In other words, psychopathy can be thought of as the worst of the worst.

                        A Psychopath's Sketch
                        Based on Hare’s list of psychopathy traits, the psychopath’s interpersonal style would appear glib and superficial, manipulative and cunning. His shallow effect belies an inability to empathize or feel guilt for wrongdoing. An appealing veneer often obscures these character deficiencies. He is a con artist, a charlatan - not what he seems to be. The psychopath behaves in impulsive and irresponsible ways that feed an excessive hunger for stimulation. This can lead to trouble. While some psychopaths find a home in careers that reward risk-taking and cold efficiency, many end up in prison or leading a parasitic life on the fringes of society. In any case, the psychopath’s life is marked by failed relationships, numerous improprieties, and, sometimes, acts of violence.

                        If psychopathy can be reduced to abnormalities in brain anatomy and function, can we blame psychopaths for their actions? Are these abnormalities congenital and/or developmentally acquired? How does this information affect treatment approaches with psychopaths? The list of ethical, clinical, and biological questions generated by such findings goes on and on. The questions will grow even more complex as brain imaging and the study of genetics advances.

                        Role of Mental Health Providers
                        Other Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Homicide
                        The Most Common Method
                        Given the recent phenomena of T.V. programs like CSI and Criminal Minds, many people are familiar with the concept of profiling. Profilers make use of psychological research on violent crime and criminals to enhance law enforcement efforts. One specific way researchers study violence is to study the perpetrators of specific types of crime. As you’ll see below, much work has been done on three types of homicide, intimate partner homicide, spree killing/mass murder, and serial killing.
                        Intimate Partner Homicide (Contd)
                        A history of non-fatal strangulation is also a significant risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Glass and colleagues (2007) found that “women who were victims of completed or attempted homicide were far more likely to have a history of strangulation [p. 332]” when compared with controls. 
                        Moreover, women with a history of being strangled had seven times the odds of becoming a victim of attempted homicide. It is important, therefore, that mental health providers inquire specifically about choking and attempted strangulation when evaluating homicide risk.
                        Profiling Intimate Partner Killers
                        Role of Mental Health Provider
                        Things to Do
                        There is no clear profile of intimate partner killers, although insecure attachment patterns, cultural factors, childhood exposure to parental intimate partner violence, and external stressors have been implicated (Elisha et al., 2010). In light of the statistics and the consequences for harm, mental healthcare providers should regularly assess their male patients for perpetrator status. While men are somewhat reluctant to admit to current intimate partner violence, they are more willing to admit to past violence, and this may be used as a prevention measure. Additionally, men are more willing to admit to perpetrating violence anonymously; however, data from this type of assessment are less likely to result in effective prevention (Jaeger et al., 2008).
                        Spree Killing or Mass Murder
                        The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders (FBI 8, 2008). The term “mass murder” is sometimes used when the homicides occur in one location.

                        In general, spree killers have an identifiable profile. They are most often white, middle-class males, single or divorced. They tend to be paranoid and depressive and have Cluster A or B personality disorders (i.e., Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal, Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic) or features of those disorders (Hare, 1993; Pinard & Pagani, 2001)
                        Structured Assessment Measures
                        Relatively little attention has been paid to risk assessment and prevention even though homicide is a leading cause of death in the U.S. While mental health professionals cannot definitively predict homicide, violence prevention in some cases may be enhanced through accurate mental health diagnosis and the use of objective screening measures or algorithms, especially in the cases of intimate partner violence and mass murder.
                        Premorbid Environmental Factors
                        Standard Measures
                        Clinicians who navigate the murky waters of assessing dangerousness need to consider premorbid environmental factors, such as childhood victimization, exposure to violence, and parental neglect; current environmental factors, such as negative peer influences, neighborhood violence, and reduced access to treatment; and clinical factors, such as severity of symptomology, symptom stability, co-morbid diagnoses, whether there is a history violent behavior, alcohol and/or substance abuse, the degree of insight, and the presence or absence of hostility (Van Dorn et al., 2012; Monahan et al., 2005). Clinicians should be aw
                        Structured Assessment Measures: Adult Measures
                        When assessing risk for violent behavior among adults, sole reliance on unstructured clinical judgments or clinical intuition is strongly ill-advised; use of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and/or other well-validated measures is recommended as standard care (Gendreau et al., 2006; Hare, 2006; Monahan et al., 2001; Quinsey et al., 2006).

                        The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare & Neumann, 2006) is the most used tool in the forensic psychologist’s bag. The PCL-R was initially developed to derive a clinical construct of psychopathy. The checklist’s 20 items load on four factors or dimensions - Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, and Antisocial - described in detail earlier in the course and summarized in Table 3. The test can be administered by a non-expert in an interview setting, and can take anywhere from a few minutes to much longer, depending on the patient’s history and whether there is any difficulty obtaining case history from external sources, such as parents or prison records.
                        are of the signs and symptoms of psychopathy as well so that they can advise potential victims and seek hospitalization for potential perpetrators.
                        Measures Specific to Intimate Partner Violence
                        The field of intimate partner violence (IPV) risk assessment (predicting recidivism and lethality) has been rapidly growing, with the majority of research conducted in the past decade. When assessing intimate partner violence (IPV), some measures are directed toward perpetrators, and some are directed toward victims of abuse.

                        Spousal Assault Risk Assessment (SARA)
                        The Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA; e.g., Hilton et al., 2004; Hilton et al., 2010) was created from research on nearly 600 cases of reported IPV and contains 13 yes/no questions that predict the risk of future assault with relatively high accuracy using these questions alone. Thus, it reduces the need for a comprehensive assessment to evaluate the risk of re-offense by male perpetrators.

                        There are many helpful scales available to assess victim risk. One such scale is the HITS (Sherin et al., 1998), which involves asking the patient about the frequency with which his or her partner has “H” art, “I” insulted, “T” threatened, or “S” creamed. Answers to the four questions are provided using a 5- 5-point Likert-type scale (1=Never to 5=Frequently), yielding a total score.
                        The HITS is a validated instrument and a popular screen for the primary care setting because it is quick and easy to use. More information about the HITS links to a PDF of the measure and scoring instructions are available to view online1, but be mindful that the HITS is copyrighted and available for public use and can only be reproduced with the author’s permissio

                        PCL-R & PCL-YV
                        Copelan et al. (2006) devised and validated an algorithm, known as the Violence Ideation and Suicidality Treatment Algorithm (VISTA), for emergency department physicians to use in identifying adolescents at risk of serious violent behavior (See Table 5 on the next page). Using VISTA, adolescents could be successfully identified as being at low, intermediate, or high risk for violent behavior with a detection sensitivity of 80.3% and a specificity of 98.1%.

                        The key points that were covered in this module are:

                            Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the contemporary mental health and criminology landscape.
                            The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations, with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.
                            Psychiatric admission can be voluntary or involuntary. Mental health professionals often play a pivotal role in initiating involuntary assessment and hospitalization.
                            Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse.
                            Mental health providers should be diligent in monitoring patients who suffer from disorders that can result in heightened paranoia and suspiciousness or other disturbances of thought, such as paranoid schizophrenia, dementia with frontal involvement, and, in some cases, organic brain disease. 
                            Since a delusion is a false notion inconsistent with the person’s background that is held with great conviction despite clear evidence to the contrary on a fundamental level, all delusions impair judgment, but not all delusions are imminently dangerous.
                            Fantasies, or daydreams, are distinguished from delusions by the patient’s control over their content, initiation, and cessation.

                        Lesson Summary
                        The key points that were covered in this module are:

                            The findings from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study led to the development of the measure, The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree or ICT.
                            Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. 
                            Psychopathy, characterized by a constellation of traits like lack of empathy and chronic manipulative behavior, does not inherently lead to violent acts like homicide, whereas homicide typology aids in categorizing different motives and patterns of lethal acts. 
                            Intimate partner violence (IPV) consists of mental, physical, and/or sexual abuse committed by an intimate partner. At the heart of IPV is the belief that one is entitled to control one’s partner and an obsessive need to exercise that control.
                            The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders. 
                            The FBI defines serial murder as “the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events.
                             The serial murderer often blends in with the community and may appear to others as a “normal” individual, although psychopathy and serial killing are closely linked.
