Learning Outcomes 1 2. Voltage and Currents 3 8 3. Digital Multimeters 4 2 4. Measuring Currents 4 2 5. Measuring Resistance 4 6Lesson SummaryFlowing electrons is called current. Voltage is the force pushing electrons through a wire. Conversely, resistance is the force that slows the flow of electrons. The type of current is determined only by the direction the current flows through a conductor. 
There are two types of currents:
- Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction, negative toward the positive pole of the source. 
- Alternating current (AC) flows back and forth because the poles of the sources alternate between positive and negative. 
A circuit is a path for current to flow. There are three basic kinds of circuits:Open circuit: the path is broken and interrupts current flowClose circuit: the path is complete and current flows where it is intended Short circuit: the path is corrupted in some way and current does not flow where it is intended. Resistance is also the impediment to the free flow of electrons through a conductor. All materials exhibit some resistance, even the best of conductors. The unit is measured in Ohm(s). 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Using Resistors 2 1 3. Introducing Capacitors 4 5 4. Introduction to Inductors 5 5 5. Introduction to Transistors 4 2 Lesson SummaryResistance is the impediment to the free flow of electrons through a conductor. All materials exhibit some resistance, even the best of conductors. The unit is measured in Ohm(s). 
Resistance generates heat, and the component must be able to dissipate this heat to prevent damage. Physical size (the surface area available to dissipate heat) is a good indicator of how much heat (power) a resistor can handle. 
A capacitor is a device that stores energy in an electric field. It possesses two conductive plates separated by a non-conductive material. Electrons accumulate on one plate, forcing electrons away from the other plate, leaving a net positive charge. 
Capacitors are rated by: Amount of charge that can be held.The voltage handling capabilities.Insulating material between plates.

In a broader sense, the term can refer to any form of cooling, heating, ventilation or disinfection that modifies the condition of air.
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.
Humidification allows the air to mix with extra water. A sufficient contact time between the air and water will normally result in the air reaching 100% Saturation. The process is very close to the evaporation from a wet bulb. It, therefore, follows a line of constant wet-bulb temperature.
Humidity ratio is the proportion of the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air at the given conditions (DBT, WBT, DPT, RH, etc).Air conditioning systems that use water as the heating or cooling fluid are called all-water or hydronic systems; those that use air are called all-air systems. A system which uses both air and water is called a combination or air-and-water system.
Refrigeration compressAir Conditioning SystemsAir conditioning is the process of treating air in an internal environment to establish and maintain the required standards of:The temperature which is controlled by heating or cooling the airHumidity, which is the measure of water vapour in the air and is controlled by adding or removing water vapour from the air (humidification or dehumidification)Cleanliness the quality of air is controlled by
  -Filtration to remove undesirable contaminants or
  -Ventilation for introducing fresh air so as to dilute the contaminants A motion which represents the velocity of the air under circulation and is controlled by the air distributing equipmentors are usually either reciprocating or of the rotary screw displacement type. Positive displacement compressors are more widely used and they are further classified as:
-ReciprocatingPsychometric Chart for Analyzing Relative HumiditySince we have addressed the issue of motion of air under ventilation, The surrounding air temperature, humidity and cleanliness are important factors which influence human comfort. The air conditioning system maintains the temperature and humidity of the accommodation area. 
The range of atmospheric temperature and humidity, considered comfortable for most people, is called the comfort zone. The four points defining the extreme corners of the comfort zones in the psychrometric chart are:20° C and 70% Relative Humidity [RH]27° C and 70% RH22° C and 40% RHFinding the Relative Humidity of AirTo understand the air conditioning system better, you should know the Ref and AC Terms used in air conditioning theory. 29° C and 40% RH
-Screw
-ScrollFinding the Relative Humidity of AirThe air conditioning system follows the same vapour compression cycle as in the refrigeration system. If the desired temperature has to be maintained is higher, then the evaporating pressure is also higher. 
The expansion valve in the air conditioning refrigerant system will expand the refrigerant to a higher pressure compared to the refrigeration system.
The atmospheric air is treated in the air handling unit. In summer, the cooling coil extracts the heat and humidity from the air.  In winter, the heating coil and humidifier treat the air to the required conditions. The air from the air handling unit is circulated throughout the ship through air ducts. The graphic below shows the single air duct air-conditioning system used onboard ships.Principles of Air ConditioningThe term air conditioning most commonly refers to the cooling and dehumidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. In a broader sense, the term can refer to any form of cooling, heating, ventilation or disinfection that modifies the condition of air. 
An air conditioner (AC or A/C in North American English, aircon in British and Australian English) is an appliance, system, or mechanism designed to stabilize the air temperature and humidity within an area (used for cooling as well as heating depending on the air properties at a given time), typically using a refrigeration cycle but sometimes using evaporation, most commonly for comfort cooling in buildings and transportation vehicles. 
The concept of air conditioning is known to have been applied in Ancient Rome, where aqueduct water was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Similar techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season. 
Modern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by Willis Haviland CarriPrinciples of Air Conditioning Air Conditioning is the process whereby the condition of air, as described by its moisture presence and temperature, is changed. Cleanliness, odour, velocity and distribution pattern are other parameters that will also be required to be controlled. 
Comfort is, of course, is a subjective condition, however, the main job of HVAC personnel is to ensure the majority of the people are brought into a comfort zone. As dealt in the topics below, it can be seen, most people i.e about say 90 % are satisfied in a temperature range and moisture percentage. Outside air is quite likely to be at a different condition from the required comfort zone condition. In order to bring its condition to within the comfort zone, we may need to do one or more of the following:-
heat it; cool it; dehumidify it; humidify it; or mix it.Psychometric Properties of Air A Psychrometric Chart is an important tool for HVAC engineers to carry out heat load or cooling load calculations and find solutions to various air condition related problems.We shall see how the air behaves when it is subjected to changes in temperature and humidity to suit the various applications for which the air conditioning is meant. The behaviour of the air can be studied very conveniently and accurately by using a psychrometric chart.Psychrometric charts are graphic representations of the psychometric properties of air. By using psychrometric charts HVAC engineers can find a solution to many practical problems without having to carry out long and tedious mathematical calculations.The psychrometric chart looks complicated with vast numbers of lines and curves in it but is very easy to understand if you know the basic properties of air. You will also understand its worth when you actually use it considering the fact that you won’t have to use any formulae to find the properties of air in different conditions, all you will have to know is two parameters of air and the rest are easily found on the chart.All the properties of air indicated in the psychrometric chart are calculated at the standard atmospheric pressure. For other pressures, relevant corrections have to be applied. The psychrometric chart looks like a shoe. The various lines shown in the chart are as followsThe temperature of the air measured by the ordinary thermometer is called as the dry bulb temperature of air, which is nothing but the atmospheric temperature.Wet and Dry Bulb HygrometerThe wet-bulb temperature of the air is also measured by the ordinary thermometer, but the only difference is that the bulb of the thermometer is covered by the wet cloth. When the air comes in contact with the wet cloth it absorbs some moisture and gives up some heat, sue to which the temperature of the air reduces. 
This reduced temperature measured by the thermometer is called as the wet-bulb temperature.
Please note that if the moisture content of the air is very low, it will give up more heat to the cloth and the wet-bulb temperature of the air will also be comparatively lower.  On the other hand, if the moisture content of air is high it will lose lesser heat to the air and wet bulb temperature will be higher. The more is the moisture or water vapour content of the air more is the wet-bulb temperature. Thus the wet-bulb temperature indirectly indicates the moisture content present in the air or we can say that it is affected by the relative humidity of the air. 
The wet-bulb temperature of the air is always less than the dry bulb temperature of the air. When air at a given temperature, contains the maximum amount of moisture for that temperature, the air is said to be saturatedWet and Dry Bulb HygrometerThe wet-bulb temperature of the air is also measured by the ordinary thermometer, but the only difference is that the bulb of the thermometer is covered by the wet cloth. When the air comes in contact with the wet cloth it absorbs some moisture and gives up some heat, sue to which the temperature of the air reduces. 
This reduced temperature measured by the thermometer is called as the wet-bulb temperature.
Please note that if the moisture content of the air is very low, it will give up more heat to the cloth and the wet-bulb temperature of the air will also be comparatively lower.  On the other hand, if the moisture content of air is high it will lose lesser heat to the air and wet bulb temperature will be higher. The more is the moisture or water vapour content of the air more is the wet-bulb temperature. Thus the wet-bulb temperature indirectly indicates the moisture content present in the air or we can say that it is affected by the relative humidity of the air. 
The wet-bulb temperature of the air is always less than the dry bulb temperature of the air. When air at a given temperature, contains the maximum amount of moisture for that temperature, the air is said to be saturatedPsychometric Properties of AirThe dew point of air is reached when the wet-bulb temperature is equal to dry bulb temperature. When air is at its dew point it is at its highest relative humidity. The temperature at which water vapour in the atmosphere begins to condense is called the Dew point temperature. When any object is cooled below the dew point temperature of the air, we can see the formation of sweat on its surface. A glass of water filled with chilled water is an example.
The total heat content of the air or enthalpy of air comprises of the sensible heat and the latent heat. The sensible heat is the heat absorbed or lost during the change in temperature of the air. The latent heat is the heat lost or absorbed during a change in phase of the water vapour present in the air. 
The sensible heat of the air is mainly due to the dry air present in the air. The dry air exists in the superheated condition in the air since it comprises of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and other inert gases that have a very low boiling point or liquefaction point. Since there is no change in the phase of dry air, it has only the sensible heat. When the temperature of the air is changed, it is the temperature of the dry air that changes and it either absorbs or liberates the sensible heat. The water vapour present within the air also absorbs or liberates the sensible heat, but this quantity is very small so it is not taken into account.
The sensible heat of the air: SH = m*0.133*DBT

Where: m is the mass of the dry air, 0.133 is the specific heat of the air in Kcal/kg and DBT is the dry bulb temperature of the air.Psychometric Properties of AirSince there is no change in the phase of the dry air present in the air mixture, it does not have any latent heat. The water vapour present within the air undergoes changes in the phase when the air is either cooled or heated hence the latent heat within the air is present due to water vapour. The latent heat of the air due to water vapour depends on the amount of moisture present in it. 
The dew point temperature of the air when it is saturated decides the amount of moisture content present within the air. Hence the latent heat of air depends on the dew point temperature of the air. This also implies that as long as the dew point temperature of the air remains constant, its latent heat will also remain constant no matter if the dry bulb temperature of the air increases or decreases.
The latent heat of the air: LH = m*w*hw
Where: m is the mass of dry air, w is the specific humidity of dry air, and hw is the specific enthalpy of water vapour taken from the steam tables as the enthalpy of water vapour at dew point temperature.
Total heat of the air = SH + LH
The sensible heat depends on dry bulb temperature of air while latent heat depends on dew point temperature of the air, hence the total quantity of heat in the air depends on the dry-bulb and dew point temperature of the air. Further, for any combination of the dry bulb and dew point temperature, there can be only one wet bulb temperature, hence the total quantity of heat in the air also depends on the wet-bulb temperature.The Psychometric ChartIt will also be interesting to note here that for various combinations of air having different dry bulb and dew point temperature, but the same wet bulb temperature, the total heat content of the air remains constant. 
The only change will be the proportion of the sensible heat and the latent heat. 
On similar lines, if the dry bulb temperature of the air is constant, the total heat content of the air depends on the wet-bulb temperature of the air. Explanation of the Psychometric ChartThe area indicated is called a comfort zone. The extent of comfort zone emphasizes the importance of relative humidity. For example, 29°C with RH of 40% result not warm. 22°C will feel too cold unless RH is above 40%. With regard to air conditioning onboard, a reasonably effective inside temperature and relative humidity in accommodation space. 20°C to 24°C with 40% to 70% of RH.
The process of removing moisture from the air is known as dehumidification. In an air conditioning system, moisture is removed from the air by dehumidifiers. Increasing the moisture content of conditioned air is known as humidification.
Heating has always been necessary for colder areas of the world. This is done by heating coils. A reheater in an air conditioning system restores the conditioned air to a comfortable level. With extreme low temperature, these primitive methods of heating increased the capacity of circulated air to absorb moisture, thereby causing drying of nasal passages and crew discomfort. 
Therefore heating should be accompanied with humidification. If cooling is not assisted with dehumidification then it will result in a large amount of condensation or sweating on bulkheads.To obtain the relative humidity from a pair of WBT and DBT, the point of intersection of lines oEnthalpy Lines Overlap the Wet-Bulb Temp LinesThe basic information used to construct the chart is the water vapour saturation data (Tsat, Pg) which is obtained from steam tables over the range from Tsat = 0.01°C through 50°C. 
The specific humidity ω is then evaluated using the relative humidity φ as a parameter to produce the various relative humidity curves (blue lines) as follows: Enthalpy Lines Overlap the Wet-Bulb Temp LinesThe major simplifying assumption in the construction of the chart is that the enthalpy of the mixture is assumed to be constant throughout the adiabatic saturation process. 
This implies that the evaporating liquid added does not significantly affect the enthalpy of the air-vapour mixture, leading to the constant slope wet bulb temperature/enthalpy (red) lines defined by: where P is the standard atmospheric pressure 101.325 [kPa].
The saturation curve (100% relative humidity) also known as the dew point curve is drawn as a red line. Notice that on the saturation curve the wet and dry bulb temperatures have the same values.f constant WBT DBT are marked on the chart. The line of relative humidity passing through this point is the required relative humidity.
The psychrometric chart is used to define air conditions and is used to convert the readings of the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures (WBT and DBT) into corresponding relative humidity. A psychrometric chart is shown above. The vertical lines represent dry bulb temperatures (DBT) and dotted lines represent relative humithalpy Lines and Wet Bulb Temp Lines when SeparatedIt is normal practice to separate out the overlapping enthalpy / wet bulb temperature lines allowing them to be separately evaluated. Thus we introduce an oblique enthalpy axis and enthalpy (black) lines as follows:
 Using the Psychometric ChartAssume that the outside air temperature is 32°C with a relative humidity φ = 60%. Use the psychrometric chart to determine the specific humidity ω, the enthalpy h, the wet-bulb temperature Twb, the dew-point temperature Tdp, and the specific volume of the dry air v. Indicate all the values determined on the chart. The specific humidity ω [18 gm-moisture/kg-air]The enthalpy h [78 kJ/kg-air],The wet-bulb temperature Twb [25.5°C],The dew-point temperature Tdp [23°C],The specific volume of the dry aPsychometric Chart Comfort Zone One of the major applications of the Psychrometric Chart is in air conditioning, and we find that most humans feel comfortable when the temperature is between 22°C and 27°C, and the relative humidity φ between 40% and 60%. 
This defines the "comfort zone" which is portrayed on the Psychrometric Chart as shown below.
Thus, with the aid of the chart we either heat or cool, add moisture or dehumidify as required in order to bring the air into the comfort zone. oing to the Comfort Zone Using Psychrometric ChartKnow how to use the chart

Exercise 2: Hot dry air at 40°C and 10% relative humidity pass through an evaporative cooler. Water is added as the air passes through a series of wicks and the mixture exits at 27°C. 
Using the psychrometric chart determine

Summer DBT 22-24 deg C and RH40-50%
Winter DBT 20 -22 Deg C and RH40%
In average, most humans feel comfortable when the temperature is between 22°C and 27°C, and the relative humidity φ between 40% and 60%. This defines the "comfort zone". 


Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation (ANSI/ ASHRAE Standard 55)).
The human body can be viewed as a heat engine where food is the input energy. The human body will generate excess heat into the environment, so the body can continue to operate. The heat transfer is proportional to temperature difference. In cold environments, the body loses more heat to the environment and in hot environments, the body does not do so. 
Both hot and cold scenarios can lead to discomfort. Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of dwellings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning) designs. Most people will feel comfortable at room temperature, colloquially a range of temperatures around 20 to 22 °C (68 to 72 °F), but this may vary greatly between individuals and depending on factors such as activity level, clothing, and humidity.Control of HumiditySteam InjectionHumidificationHumidity RatioHumidity ControlSteam is normally Injected into fresh outdoor air that is supplied to the air conditioning plant for required conditioning and thus humidities are maintained at the required level. Analysis of the process is carried out by considering mass and energy balances.
If mv is the mass of steam supplied with enthalpy hv and ma the mass of dry air, then leaving the air state is stated by
 ω2 = ω1 + mv /ma
 h2 = h1 +(mv /ma) hv
In the dry bulb temperature of the air, there is hardly a variationAirflow and Air Conditioning CapacityAssuming an outside dry bulb temperature of 35° C /95° F. and a wet-bulb temperature of 28° C /82° F. (this condition changes with the trade route encountered), the. cooling equipment should be capable of maintaining automatically, a temperature of 29.5° C /85° F. dry bulb and relative humidity not exceeding 50 per cent for state-rooms and similar spaces. The equipment for dining saloons and like spaces should be capable of maintaining a dry bulb temperature of 27° C / 80° F. and relative humidity not to exceed 55 per cent.
In order to reduce the air conditioning machinery load as much as possible, with resultant savings in investment for the machinery and accessory equipment, only a part of the air circulated in an air-conditioned space is outside air, the balance being recirculated. 
This means that only a part of the total air circulated is exhausted to the atmosphere during a single cycle of operation. The percentage of outside air introduced into the space is only sufficient to provide proper ventilation and is approximately 20 per cent of the total. The amount of outside air considered necessary for proper ventilation is also a variable, depending upon the size of the space and the number of persons accommodated.
The air conditioning load for an air-conditioned space is also dependent upon the type of boundaries that enclose the space. It is necessary to know to what extent heat or refrigerating loss may take place through such boundaries.
The heat transfer coefficients are based on the supposition that all exposed surfaces are properly insulated from the weather and against sweating. Further consideration must be given to overcome the heat gain due to electric lights, and other external heat source and sensible and latent heat of persons in the air-conditioned space.The Calculation for Ships PlantsThe components of the cooling load for air-conditioning can now be summarized as follows. The load is classified as the room load that falls on the room directly and the total load that falls on the apparatus.Cabin Load - Room Sensible Heat  (RSH)Cabin Load - Room (Cabin) Latent Heat (RLH)Total Load on Air Conditioning ApparatusHeat Balance MethodA. Room Sensible Heat (RSH)
1. Solar and Transmission heat gain through partition walls, ceiling etc.
2. Solar and transmission heat gain through portholes Glasses.
3. Transmission Gain through adjacent cabin partitions, ceiling, floor etc.
4. Infiltration
5. Internal heat gain from people, power, lights, appliances, etc.
6. Additional heat gain not accounted above, safety factor etc
7. Supply Duct Gain, supply duct leakage loss and blower horsepower.
a. The sum all above gives the room sensible heat (RSH) load. For the purpose of psychometric analysis, the following component is also included in the room sensible heat.
8. Bypassed outside air loadHeating Load EstimateAn estimate of the heating load is made on the basis of the maximum probable heat loss of the room or space to be heated. Thus the plant for heating is to be so designed that it has a capacity just sufficient to meet the heating load requirement which develops when most severe weather conditions occur. In this respect, very brief periods of severe weather need not be taken into account.
The following points may be taken into account when Heat Load required calculations are done.Transmission Heat LossSolar RadiationInternal Heat GainsThe transmission heat loss from walls, roof, etc., calculated on the basis of just the design outside and inside· air temperature difference. Q = U A (ti – t0) Thus, no allowances need to be made for the walls and roof being exposed sun. Also, the time lag and decrement factor are to be ignored.Also, the heating plant should have sufficient capacity to bring up the inside temperature to the design value before the occupants come in.
The sum of items (1) to (8) gives the effective room sensible heat (ERSH)Introduction to Air Conditioning Systems Heat always travels from a warmer to a cooler area. In winter, there is a continual heat loss from within the structure to the outdoors. If the air inside the ship's structure-accommodation etc; is to be maintained at a comfortable temperature, heat must be continually supplied to the air in the rooms. The equipment that furnishes the heat required is called a heating system. 
In summer, heat continually enters the ship's structure from the outside. In order to maintain the accommodation and some working spaces air at a comfortable temperature, this excess heat must be continually removed from these places. The equipment that removes this heat is called a cooling system. An air conditioning system may provide heating, cooling, or both. Most heating and cooling systems have the following basic components:A heating source that adds heat to a fluid (air. water, or steam)The cooling source that removes heat from a fluid (air or water)A distribution system (a network of ducts or piping) to carry the fluid to the space to be heated or cooledEquipment (fans or pumps) for moving the air or waterDevices for transferring heat between the fluid and the roomAir conditioning systems that use water as the heating or cooling fluid are called all-water or hydronic systems; those that use air are called all-air systems. A system which uses both air and water is called a combination or air-and-water system. The air conditioning plant is normally run in automatic mode. The required temperRefrigerant CompressorIn winter, the steam supply to the heating coil is automatically controlled according to the set temperature. In summer, the refrigerant compressor cuts in cuts out automatically to maintain the set temperature. A thermostat senses the outlet temperature of the air handling unit and stops the compressor when the set temperature is reached.
The capacity of the compressor is controlled by unloading part of the cylinders. When the load on the plant reduces the compressor runs partly loaded that is refrigerant is compressed only in part of the cylinders. When the cooling demand decreases, the expansion valve reduces the refrigerant flow which reduces suction pressure of the compressor. Depending on the suction pressure the compressor runs partly or fully loaded. omponents (Direct Expansion System) - EvaporatorThe air handling unit consists of a fan, air filter, evaporator coil, heating coil, and a humidifier. The fans are fitted to provide adequate air circulation at the required velocity. The fresh air and the recirculated air pass through the air inlet filter. The control air flap controls the amount of air recirculated. 
The refrigerant after the expansion valve flows through the evaporator coil. The latent heat of vapourisation for the liquid refrigerant is taken from the air flowing over the coil. Steam heating coils are provided for heating the air in cold climates. The humidifier reduces the dryness of heated air. ponents (Direct Expansion System) - Expansion ValveThe thermostatic expansion valve allows the refrigerant to expand at a controlled rate, depending on the load.
This valve measures the exit temperature of the refrigerant from the evaporator and controls the refrigerant flow to the evaporator so that the liquid completely changes to vapour before leaving the evaporator. 
A thermostatic expansion valve consists of a valve body with a valve seat, a thermostatic element separated from the valve body by a diaphragm and a spring. A capillary tube connects the element to the bulb. in larger plants where pressure drop in the evaporator is more, an equalising or balancing line is provided. This connects the evaporator outlet to the lower side of the diaphragm. This eliminates further increase in superheat temperature to compensate for the reduction in pressure and so allows an increase in the effective area of the evaporator.Components (Direct Expansion System) - Filter DrierThe filter drier unit consists of a metal mesh and a desiccant. It filters the coarse contaminants and removes the moisture. It neutralizes acid formed by the interaction of moisture and oil. The unit allows the refrigerant to flow in one direction only and the direction of flow is marked on the filter body. 
If wrongly fitted, it restricts the refrigerant flow. The whole filter drier unit has to be replaced periodically. as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. It cannot be cleaned or reconditioned. The mesh is made of brass and the desiccant is activated alumina. The outer casing is made of steel. Sensing Suction TemperatureIn a direct-expansion application, where the refrigerant in the evaporator is cooling air, frost protection can be accomplished in a number of ways. 
As mentioned, if the surface temperature of the coil gets too cold, the moisture that condenses out of the air can form frost on the surface of the coil. This “coil frosting” is detrimental to system performance and compressor reliability. Historically, indirect -expansion air conditioning applications, hot gas bypass, coil pressure regulators, and defrost cycles initiated by a timer, pressure sensor, or temperature sensor are a few of the methods that have been used to prevent evaporator frosting. This will focus on two of these— a defrost cycle initiated by a temperature sensor and hot gas bypass.


A temperature sensor on the suction line leaving the evaporator is used to determine if the coil reaches a frosting condition. Compressors are turned off and the supply fan continues to run to de-ice the coil. Timers prevent the compressors from rapid cycling.

This control scheme is especially well suited for equipment using scroll compressors, which are designed to start and stop much more often than large reciprocating compressors.Domestic Refrigeration Plant Layout Refrigeration system isolation valves are specially designed with a back-seat, as well as a front-seat to permit repacking High-Pressure and Low-Pressure Cut-OutsHigh Pressure Cut OutLow Pressure Cut Out / Cut-In In the event of overpressure on the high-pressure side of the compressor i.e. on the condenser side, the high pressure cut out will cause the compressor to shut down. The device is reset by hand. There are a number of faults that cause high discharge pressure including loss of condenser cooling air in the system overcharged. 
The bellows in the cutout are connected by a small-bore pipe between the compressor discharge and condenser. The bellows tend to. be expanded by the refrigerant pressure and this movement is opposed by the spring. The adjustment screw is used to set the spring pressure.
During normal system operation, the switch arm is held up by the switch arm catch which holds the electrical contact in place. Excessive pressure expands the bellows and moves the switch arm catch around its pivot. The upper end slips to the right of the step and releases the switch arm so breaking the electrical contact and causing the compressor to cut out. The machine cannot be restarted until the trouble, has been remedied and the switch reset by hand.Evaporating and Condensing TemperatureA change in the evaporation or the condensing temperature influences the operating conditions for the compressor. Any change in temperature affects the density of the refrigerant, which alters the compression ratio between the low-pressure and high-pressure sides. 
The high temperature in the evaporator is equivalent to high pressure and high vapour density. This means that 1 kg high-pressure vapour occupies less volume than 1 kg low-pressure vapour. In a refrigerant system, the mass flow of high-pressure vapour into the compressor is, therefore, larger at each displacement than the mass flow of low-pressure vapour. To maintain a specific suction pressure, i.e. to maintain a specific evaporating temperature, the evaporator must be designed to vaporize the same mass of refrigerant as is compressed in the compressor.CondenserEvaporator The condenser removes heat given off during the liquefaction of vaporized refrigerant. Heat is given off as the temperature drops to condensation temperature. Then, more heat (specifically the latent heat of condensation) is released as the refrigerant liquefies. There are air-cooled and water-cooled condensers, named for their condensing medium. The more popular is the air-cooled condenser for smaller units. The condensers consist of tubes with external fins. The refrigerant is forced through the condenser. In order to remove as much heat as possible, the tubes are arranged to maximize surface area. 
Fans are often used to increase airflow by forcing air over the surfaces, thus increasing the condenser capability to give off heat. The heat removed from the refrigerant in the condenser of a refrigeration plant is the heat of compression- popularly known as latent heat of condensation. The coolant used for a finned condenser is air. The accumulation of air and other noncondensable gases in a refrigeration system will collect in the condenser. After the Freon leaves the condenser, the storage spaComponents of the CondenserThe condenser is of the shell and tube type using the same tubing as the cooler (see Fig. for details). The standard tube bundle employs copper tubes rolled into cupro-nickel tube sheets. Two intermediate support sheets are provided into which the tubes are expanded.
The ends of the tubes are belled where they are rolled into the sheets, and the advantage of a removable tube is thus obtained. The tubes are expanded into two intermediate support sheets.
An important function of the condenser is to collect and concentrate non-condensable gases (air) so that they may be removed by the evacuation system. The top portion of the-condenser is baffled for this reason. The baffle encloses a portion of the first water pass. The non-condensable naturally rise to this location because of their lower density, and because it is the coolest portion of the condenser. Flooded Chiller In case of the flooded the evaporator is filled with the refrigerant and constant level of the refrigerant is maintained inside it. In these evaporators or the chillers, the refrigerant is along the shell side while the substance to be chilled or freezer flows along the tube side of the heat exchanger.Classification of EvaporatorsThough this classification is also applicable to the domestic refrigerators and the air conditioners, the evaporators used in these systems are classified based on their construction. The evaporators are classified based on the construction as:Bare tube evaporators: The bare tube evaporators are the simple copper coil evaporators over which the substance to be cooled flowsPlate surface evaporators: The plate surface evaporators are commonly used in the household refrigerators. These evaporators are also in the form of the coil which is attached to the plate.Finned evaporators: The finned evaporators are also made of the copper coil with fins on the external surface as well on the internal surface. ce for the liquid refrigerant is called a receiver.Types of Heat TransferBasic Design of a heat exchanger is dependent on the heat transfer required between two fluids and resultant heat transfer area that will have to be designed to suit the flow rates and temperature range.
In a heat exchanger temperature of both fluids change as a result of heat exchange, however, this may not be so if one of the fluids changes from one phase to another phase. Design of heat exchanger has to take this into account.
Heat Transfer - Heat flows from an object at a higher temperature to that of a lower temperature. The heat flow can be achieved in three different ways namely, conduction, convection and radiation.
Consider two fluids at different temperatures separated by a surface. The heat transfer takes place from the hot fluid to the cold fluid. The rate at which the heat transfer takes place depends on the following factorsThe temperature difference between the two fluidsConductivity of the surface materialThickness of the surface materialThe Rate of Heat TransferIf the rate of heat transfer Q has to be increased, then either one of the above-mentioned factors has to be increased. But, the temperature difference ΔT and the area A are limited depending on the applications.
The overall heat transfer coefficient depends on the properties of the fluids, their velocities and type of the surface where heat transfer takes place. 
The properties of fluids cannot be altered, but the pattern of flow of the fluids can be changed by varying the velocity. By increasing the velocities of the fluids, the overall heat transfer coefficient can be increased. Oil RectifierSome refrigerants are miscible with the compressor lubricating oil which means that the two substances form a mutual solution. Because oil carryover does occur, the miscibility is actually beneficial because the oil tends to be taken around the refrigeration circuit and back to the compressor, by the refrigerant. 
If the oil and refrigerant are not miscible, as is the case with oil and CO2, then there may be a loss of lubricant from the compressor sump and accumulation in the system. With CO2 the oil collected in the evaporator and was drained off regularly by hand, then returned to the compressor after being strained.  The oil rectifier can be fitted to drain oil from the evaporator, automatically, and return it to the compressor. The oil is automatically bled from the evaporator to a heat exchanger in which liquid refrigerant mixed with the oil is vaporized. The heat for vaporizing the refrigerant is obtained by passing warm liquid refrigerant from the condenser, through the heat exchanger. 

Vapour and oil are passed to the compressor where the oil returns to the sump while the freon passes to the compressor suction. The regulator is a thermostatically controlled valve which operates in the same way as the expansion valve in the main system. It automatically bleeds the oil from the evaporator so that the gas leaves the rectifier heat exchanger iOil Separator n a superheated condition.A condenser is a device used to condense a gas or vapour into a liquid state. In a refrigeration system, it is in the condenser where heat is rejected. The superheated vapour from the compressor is de-super heated in the first few coils of the condenser. Further condensation of the vapour takes place at the saturated condensing temperature.
An evaporator is a device used to evaporate the refrigerant by absorbing the heat from the concerned space or substance. The evaporator is the most important component as the performance of the refrigeration system depends on the operation of the evaporator. It also influences the performance of the compressor as the evaporator has to deliver a dry vapour refrigerant to the compressor.iquid-line Filter/DrierRefrigerant driers are recommended for all refrigerating systems employing a hydrocarbon refrigerant. Moisture in the Freon system should always be avoided as it would lead to ice formation at the expansion valves. Also, it may cause corrosion of the steel parts the product of which may also block the expansion valves and form sludge in the lube oil.
The most common drying agents used are silica gel, alumina gel and synthetic silicates as these are excellent moisture absorbent. Driers absorb water faster at a lower temperature; therefore the drier should be installed in the liquid line just before the refrigerant flow control device. A non-refillable drier has an arrow stamped or cast on the body to indicate the direction that the refrigerant should flow through it. one must en Diploma in Marine Refrigeration and Climate Control tshingombe fiston 63% Finish your profile XP 42360 Get Your Certificates Your Dashboard Your Achievements Recommended For You Career Ready Plan Affiliate Dashboard Create Resumé enChange Language Account Settings FAQs Logout Course Modules Module 1 Ventilation Systems 1.

In doing so, these systems control the quality of breathing air and protect personnel and sensitive equipment from potentially hazardous airborne contaminants, fires, explosions, and excessive heat. The ability of ventilation systems to protect personnel from these hazards is particularly important aboard ships, which are like floating cities fitted into a very limited space. Well designed and easily maintained ventilation systems are critical to a safe and comfortable shipboard work environment.
Ventilation systems include a supply, or makeup air system and an exhaust system. Supply systems replace contaminated air exhausted from a workspace with uncontaminated outside air. Supply ventilation systems also provide replenishment air to air conditioning recirculation systems. Exhaust systems remove Buildup of dirt that obstructs airflow through ventilation system odours, heated air, and airborne contaminants from the workspace. Both supply and exhaust airflow quantities must be balanced.
All components of ventilation systems such as fans, motors, ducts, dampers, air intakes and outlets, filters, and access panels, must work properly in order for the systems to operate safely and efficiently.
Ventilation is a process for controlling certain physical and chemical properties of air in a space to provide comfort and sanitation for the occupants, preserve goods, prevents the accumulation of dangerous gases and maintain conditions necessary for proper operation of equipment.Factors Controlled by VentilationThe ventilation normally controls the following:Air purity of space (bacterial, dust, odours etc)The temperature rise of spaceAir distribution and air velocity in spaceThe humidity of space containing a source of moisture.A ship can be divided into 3 basic sections e.g., Living, working and storing spaces. Living spaces comprise cabins, passageways, dining and messrooms, lavatory, bath etc; working spaces include machinery space, galley, pump room, pantry, CO2 room etc. and storing spaces refer to compartments for the carriage of cargo, provisions and gears required for use onboard.
In most ships, a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation is provided in all three above sections. Old practices of complete dependence on only natural ventilation which in turn were based on ship and wind movement are now obsolete.Types of VentilationVentilation is the provision of a supply of fresh untreated air through space. There are two types of ventilation, namely:Natural VentilationMechanical or Forced Ventilation Natural ventilation occurs when changes in temperature or air density cause circulation in the space.
 It could be used for some small working and stores areas but is impractical for working areas where machinery is present or a number of people are emNatural Laws of Air CirculationNatural laws of air circulation: Warm air, like any other gas that has been heated, tends to expand and rise. Cool air is heavier than warm air and therefore tends to fall and take the place of the lighter rising warm air. This difference in the densities of air at different temperatures produces a circulation within a cargo hold. The air in the lower portions of the space is relatively warmer than in the higher portions and will rise in conformity with the natural laws of air circulation. Cargo Space VentilationSweat is the name given to water vapour in the air inside a vessel’s cargo hold that condenses to form water droplets.
Damage to cargo can happen because of several reasons such as accident, flooding, rainwater, etc. Of all the reasons, moisture is one of the most common causes of cargo damage and a source of significant cargo claims. Moisture responsible for cargo damage is also called “sweat” on ships. In order to prevent damage of cargo because of moisture, ships are fitted with natural or forced ventilation systems.
There are two types of Sweat that could occur on a vessel:Ship’s sweat; condensation that takes on the ship’s structureCargo sweat; condensation that takes place directly on to the cargoCargo Sweat and Condensation on CargoCargo sweat is the condensation of water vapour directly on to the cargo. Cargo sweat can arise when passing from cold to warmer climatic conditions since the cause is from the warmer moisture-laden air condensing on the cargo. Its prevention is by sealing off the ventilating facilities, although extraction fans will be necessary to offset any moisture effects emanating from the cargo itself, or its dunnage materials.
Condensation on the surface of the cargo: Condensation can form on the cargo as a result of climatic conditions. Cargo sweat can always occur when the temperature of the cargo is lower than or equal to the dew point. It can also occur during transportation from temperate latitudes, e.g. from northern-hemisphere winter to the tropics. Proper cargo hold ventilation is also effective in controlling hull corrosion caused by the presence of moisture and free water inside cargo holds. IntroductionIn many of the cargo ships, the bunker oil carrying tanks are also provided with tank heating arrangement. But we are focusing on the tank ships carrying oil cargoes, where heating of the cargoes while on transit may be a regular need and thus requires an elaborate cargo heating system. 
Heavy fractions, such as fuel oil become very thick and sluggish when cold, and, in order that such oils can be loaded and discharged without delay, it is necessary to keep them heated.
A loaded tanker has comparatively little freeboard, and the temperature of the seawater and the air temperature through which the vessel is passing is of major significance. Coldwater washing around the ship's bottom, and across the decks, rapidly reduces the temperature of the cargo and makes the task of heating it much harder. Warm seawater, however, has the reverse effect and can be very useful in helping to maintain the temperature of the cargo with a minimum of steam.
Oil cargoes change volume due to changes in temperatures and an elaborate venting system is thus required, not only for vessel's sea passage but for facilitating cargo loading, discharge and tank entry.IntroductionAny device that produces a current of air by the movement of broad surfaces can be called a fan. Fans fall under a general category of turbomachinery and have a rotating impeller at least partially encased in a stationary housing. Fans are similar in many respects to pumps. It is easy to distinguish between fans and pumps: pumps handle liquids; fans handle air/gasses. Broadly speaking, the function of a fan is to propel, displace, or move air or gas. 
Fans, blowers and compressors are differentiated by the method used to move the air, and by the system pressure they must operate against Fans and blowers provide air for ventilation and industrial process requirements. Fans generate a pressure to move air (or gases) against a resistance caused by ducts, dampers, or other components in a fan system. 
Fan systems consist of a fan, an electric motor, a drive system, ducts or piping, flow control devices, and air conditioning equipment (filters, cooling coils, heat exchangers, eDifference between Fans, Blowers and CompressorsFans, blowers and compressors are differentiated by the method used to move the air, and by the system pressure, they must operate against. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) uses the specific ratio, which is the ratio of the discharge pressure over the suction pressure, to define fans, blowers and compressors.Equipment Specific RatioPressure rise (mmWg)Fansup to 1.111136Blowers1.11 to 1.201136-2066Compressorsmore than 1.20-System ResistanceThe term “system resistance” is used when referring to static pressure. The system resistance is the sum of static pressure losses in the system. The system resistance is a function of the configuration of ducts, pickups, elbows and the pressure drops across equipment, for example, bag filter or cyclone. The system resistance varies with the square of the volume of air flowing through the system. 

For a given volume of air, the fan in a system with narrow ducts and multiple short radius elbows is going to have to work harder to overcome a greater system resistance than it would in a system with larger ducts and a minimum number of long radius turns. Thus, the system resistance increases substantially as the volume of air flowing through the system increases; the square of airflow. Conversely, resistance decreases as flow decreases.  Axial Flow FanAxial Flow Fan with Vane PerformanceAxial Flow Fan Performance Centrifugal Fans and BlowersThere exist two main fan types: Centrifugal fans use a rotating impeller to move the air stream. Axial fans move the airstream along the axis of the fan. Centrifugal fans are one of the most common machines used in the industry. They utilize a rotating element with blades, vanes, or propellers to extract or deliver a specific volume of air or gas. The rotating element is mounted on a rotating shaft that must provide the energy required to overcome inertia, friction, and other factors that restrict or resist air or gas flow in the application. These generally are low-pressure machines designed to overcome friction and either suction or discharge-system pressure.
Centrifugal fans increase the speed of an airstream with a rotating impeller. The speed increases as the air reach the ends of the blades and are then converted to pressure. These Radial-Blade FansIndustrial exhaust fans fall into this category. The blade shape varies considerably from flat to various bent configurations to increase efficiency slightly or to suit particular applications.Advantages of Radial Blade FansLimitations of Radial- Best suited for severe duty, especially when fitted with flat radial blades.
- Simple construction that lends itself to easy field maintenance.
- Highly versatile industrial fan that can be used in extremely dusty environments as well as clean air. 
- Appropriate for high-temperature service.
- Handles corrosive or abrasive materials.fans are able to produce relatively higher pressures, wEnergy Efficiency OpportunitiesChoose the right fanImportant considerations when selecting a fan are:
- Noise
- Rotational speed
- Airstream characteristics
- Temperature range
- Variations in operating conditions
- Space constraints and system layout
- Purchase costs, operating costs (determined by efficiency and maintenance), and operating life.

But, as a general rule, it is important to know that to effectively improve the performance of fan systems, designers and operators must understand how other system components function as well. The “systems approach” requires knowing the interaction between fans, the equipment that supports fan operation, and the components that are served by fans. 
A common problem is that companies purchase oversized fans for their service requirements. They will not operate at their best efficiency point (BEP) and in extreme cases, these fans may operate in an unstable manner because of the point of operation on the fan airflow pressure curve. Oversized fans generate excess flow energy, resulting in high airflow noise and increased stress on the fan and the system. Consequently, oversized fans not only cost more to purchase and to operate, but they also create avoidable system performance problems. Possible solutions include, among others are, replacing the fan, replacing the motor, or introducing a variable speed drive motor.Reduce the system resistance
Operate close to BEPMaintain fans regularly




Damper Controlshich makes them suitable for harsh operating conditions, such as systems with high temperatures, moist or dirty air streams. Centrifugal fans are categorized by their blade shapes:Lesson SummaryVentilation is a process for controlling certain physical and chemical properties of air in a space to provide comfort and sanitation for the occupants, preserve goods, prevents the accumulation of dangerous gases and maintain conditions necessary for proper operation of equipment. 
Ventilation systems include a supply, or makeup air system and an exhaust system. All components of ventilation systems such as fans, motors, ducts, dampers, air intakes and outlets, filters, and access panels, must work properly in order for the systems to operate safely and efficiently.Ventilation normally controls the following:
- Air purity of space (bacterial, dust, odours etc)
- Temperature rise of space
- Air distribution and air velocity in space
- Humidity of space containing a source of moistureThe two types of ventilation include: natural and mechanical. There are two types of sweat that could occur on a vessel: ship's sweat and cargo sweat. Controlled venting systems are done in two ways; mast riser venting and high-velocity venting. 
Engine room ventilation is a critical factor as air is necessary for combustion for highly turbocharged main / aux diesel engines, main / aux boiler, in addition to air compressors etc 1.

Loading and Handling Refrigerated Cargo 1 32Learning OutcomesUpon the successful completion of this module, you should be able to:Explain the concept of refrigeration as the reversed Carnot cycle.Discuss the working principles of a vapour-compression refrigerant cycle.Describe the basic layout of a direct expansion system.State the difference of a cargo refrigeration system and a ship's store or domestic refrigeration plant on board.
Discuss the principle of direct and indirect expansion systems.Explain the principles of a cascade system of refrigeration using multiple compression.Describe various types of refrigerated cargoes aRefrigerationThe task of a refrigeration or air-conditioning system is to maintain the temperature of an enclosed space below its surroundings. Since heat naturally flows from higher temperature areas to lower temperature areas, a device must be constructed to move the thermal energy in the opposite direction. The rate at which heat must be removed from the cooled space is the refrigeration (or cooling) load. This load is the sum of a variety of loads including :Heat transferred through the walls of the cooled space.The heat from the outside air entering the space.The heat from sources within the space such as people and equipment.The first means of refrigeration used by humans was the melting of ice blocks. When mechanical refrigeration systems were developed, it was natural to express the cooling capacity of the new systems in terms similar to that of melting ice.
A common unit of refrigeration is the cooling effect of 1 ton (2,000 lbs) of ice melting at a constant rate in one day. The latent heat of fusion of ice is 144 Btu/lbm (334.9 kJ/kg), and so the refrigeration produced by 2,000 lbm (907.18 kg) or 1 ton of ice is 288,000 Btu (3.0384 x 105 kJ).

One ton of refrigeration is thus 288,000 Btu divided by 24 hours. Hence;
1 ton of refrigeration = 288,000 Btu/ 24 hrs = 12,000 Btu/hr; or 12659 KJ/hnd preparations and precautions required in handling such cargoes.Evaluate the types of cooling arrangements required for reefer containers and a fully refrigerated ship.Latent Heat of FusionRefrigeration system works on the principle of cooling by evaporation. When a liquid evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surroundings. The heat absorbed during this process is called the latent heat of evaporation. The temperature at which the liquid evaporates depends on the existing pressure.
When a substance changes from a solid to a liquid without a temperature change, the change is caused by 'Latent heat of Fusion'. The evaporation of a liquid occurs at a lower temperature as the pressure is reduced. The desired low temperature is achieved by evaporating a liquid at a low pressure suitable for extracting the latent heat at the desired temperature.

Different "refrigerants" are used depending on the required temperature and the type of installation available for producing the low pressure. In the refrigeration cycle, when the vapour Coefficient of PerformanceThe coefficient of performance is used to quantify the performance of refrigeration cycles.The symbol used for the coefficient of performance is “COP” with a subscript “R,” for refrigeration.
Just like the efficiency of power cycles, the COP is defined as the ratio of the desired output to the required input.
We do not call this an efficiency because it is generally GREATER than 1. It would seem very odd to discuss efficiencies greater than 1. So, instead, we call it the coefficient of performance.
Heat transfer depends on the properties of the refrigerant. Different refrigerants will obviously have different enthalpy values for a given state. In dealing with one specific refrigerant, the enthalpy values depend on the temperatures and pressures in the warm and cold regions. The surrounding temperature affects how well the refrigeration system is able to cool the enclosed region.
Clearly, if the outside temperature is very hot (i.e. much above room temperature), the system may not be as successful in lowering the temperature of the enclosed region as it would at room temperature.is condensed back to liquid, the same amount of latent heat is released.
A compressor is used to compress the vapour and increase its temperature above that of the atmosphere. This allows air or water at normal atmospheric temperature to be used as the cooling medium in the condenser. Any vapour or gas can be liquefied by compression and cooling.Refrigeration Vapor COP Refrigeration with Extra Cooling EffectIf the condenser can sub-cool the refrigerant to a temperature less than saturation liquid temperature and the refrigerant vapour absorbs more heat while in the evaporator then extra cooling effect will result as shown below:Stage 1 - 2: The superheated vapour is compressed.Stage 2 - 3: The hot superheated vapour enters the condenser where the first part of the process is desuperheating.
Stage 3 - 4: The hot vapour is condensed back to a saturated liquid.
Stage 4 - 5: The liquid is subcooled before it enters the expansion valve (this may occur in the condenser, a second heat exchanger or in the pipework connecting the condenser with the expansion valve).
Stage 5 - 6:  The high-pressure liquid passes through an expansion device.
Stage 6 -7: Low-pressure liquid refrigerant in the evaporator absorbs heat from the surroundings being cooled and evaporates to become dry saturated vapour.
Stage 7 - 1: The refrigerant vapour absorbs more heat while in the evaporator and while in the pipework joining the evaporator to the compressor, to become a superheated vapour. This improves CORefrigeration with Extra Cooling Effect Refrigeration ThermodynamicsFundamental to understanding sensible heat and latent heat is the use of the refrigerant in cooling systems. It also explains why the terms 'total capacity' (sensible & latent heat) and 'sensible capacity' are used to define a unit's cooling capacity. During the cooling cycling, condensation forms within the unit due to the removal of latent heat from the air. Sensible capacity is the capacity required to lower the temperature and latent capacity is the capacity to remove the moisture from the air. 
Refrigeration system works on the principle of cooling by evaporation. When a liquid evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surroundings. The heat absorbed during this process is called the latent heat of evaporation. The temperature at which the liquid evaporates depends on the existing pressure. The evaporation of a liquid occurs at a lower temperature as the pressure is reduced. The desired low temperature is achieved by evaporating a liquid at a low pressure suitable for extracting the latent heat at the desired temperature.
At point 1, the circulating refrigerant enters the compressor as a saturated vapour. From point 1 to point 2, the vapour is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as superheated vapour.
From point 2 to point 3, the superheated vapour travels through part of the condenser which removes the superheat by cooling the vapour.Vapour Compression Refrigeration and Pressure-Enthalpy ChartIt should be noted that the above discussion is based on the ideal vapour-compression refrigeration cycle which does not take into account real situation like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight internal irreversibility during the compression of the refrigerant vapour, or non-ideal gas behaviour if any. P-H chart (Pressure – Enthalpy chart) Pressure – Absolute pressure. Unit: bar, psiEnthalpy – Total amount of energy per unit weight of the substance. Unit: BTU/Lb or kJ/kgThe lines, saturated liquid & vapour respectively are plots of pressure vs enthalpy for the saturated state of a given refrigerant.
This chart is used to understand the property changes that take place in each phase of the cycle.Ideal Refrigeration Cycle: Pressure-Enthalpy Chart and Graph Pressure-Enthalpy chartEnthalpy: Total amount of energy a substance has 1-2: EVAPORATOR – extraction of heat from the room2-3: COMPRESSOR – compression work3-4: CONDENSER – energy is thrown to the sea4-1: EXPANSION VALVE – throttling at the expansion valve   For each kg of refrigerant flow,
Energy extracted from meat room: 304 - 150 = 154 KJ/kg
Work spent on compressor = 365 – 304 = 61 KJ/KgVapour Compression Refrigeration CycleRefrigerant is circulated through a refrigeration system by the compressor. In a refrigeration system, a compressor rather than a pump is needed to circulate the refrigerant because the refrigerant must be compressed to be liquefied. The temperature of the refrigerant gas is highest at the compressor discharge.
The refrigerant is cooled in the condenser by seawater or low-temperature central freshwater is typically provided to condense the refrigerant gas in a ship's stores refrigeration plant.
Refrigeration removes heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and rejects it elsewhere, for the primary purpose of lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance, and then maintaining that lower temperature. The transfer medium is a refrigerant that undergoes a change in phase from gas to liquid and back.
The most widely used refrigerants were Freon-12 (R-12) and Freon-22 (R-22) until concernVapour Compression Refrigeration Cycle about depletion of the ozone layer arose in the 1980s. They are being replaced by R-134a and other blends.  Superheating and Subcooling Direct and Brine SystemThere are two systems employed: Direct Expansion and Brine SystemDirect Expansion SystemBrine SystemThe direct expansion is large scale unit and handles a large number of refrigerants. Any leakage or accident in the unit can lead to mishap and damages.
Thus, it is sensible to operate the unit at a farther place and use a secondary flow line with a safe working medium like water to transfer the heat from the concerned space or substance to the refrigerant. This type of system is called the indirect expansion plant.Direct Expansion System - Diagram Brine System Refrigeration PlantThe refrigeration plant is a large scale unit which refrigerates a large space or substance. Although it is similar to a commercial refrigerator, it consists of a lot of additional components like pressure switches, valves, etc., for safe and smooth operation. Refrigeration system works on the principle of cooling by evaporation. When a liquid evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surroundings. The heat absorbed during this process is called the latent heat of evaporation. The temperature at which the liquid evaporates depends on the existing pressure.
The evaporation of a liquid occurs at a lower temperature as the pressure is reduced. The desired low temperature is achieved by evaporating a liquid at a low pressure suitable for extracting the latent heat at the desired temperature.
Different refrigerants are used depending on the required temperature and the type of installation available for producing the low pressure. In the refrigeration cycle, when the vapour is condensed back to liquid, the same amount of latent heat is released.
A compressor is used to compress the vapour and increase its temperature above that of the atmosphere. This allows air or water at normal atmospheric temperature to be used as the cooling medium in the condenser. Any vapour or gas can be liquefied by compression and cooling.Introduction to Cargo and Domestic Refrigeration Plants Both use the vapour compression system, if the distance from the Compressor is more, then both use a secondary refrigeration system, wherein the primary refrigerant cools the secondary refrigerant which in turn cools the cargo or domestic refrigeration space.
Vapour Compression Refrigeration Plants have a Basic refrigeration cycle wherein the Heat energy flows from a hot region to a cooler region.  Vapour Compression Refrigeration System uses a circulating refrigerant as a medium which:Absorbs & removes heat from space to be cooledRejects the heat elsewhere (cooler)
The correct term for a coil using a thermostatic Expansion Valve, capillary tubes, or restrictor is Direct Expansion. Continuous Refrigeration Cycle ComponentsVapour Compression System: as shown below have 4 principle components:EvaporatorCompressorCondenserExpansion Valve Refrigeration Cycle ComponentsEvaporatorCompressorCondenserExpansion Valve- The evaporator coils are located in the compartment to be cooled
- The low-pressure liquid refrigerant, after passing through the expansion valve, expands
- Takes in heat from the surrounding and evaporates
- The gas is then sucked up by the compressorThe refrigeration plant runs continuously to maintain the cold room temperatures. The compressor cuts in and cuts out automatically, depending on the room temperatures. Two plants of the same refrigerating capacity are provided so that one plant will be available during the maintenance of the other plant. 
 The vapour compression system uses the same components to absorb and to reject the heat. Previously, popular refrigerants are found to be unfriendly to ecology and the use of these are banned and these refrigerants are replaced by eco-friendly refrigerants. You will read more about these in the following subtopics.refrigeration is accomplished onboard by the vapour compression cycle commonly known as the simple compression cycle.Overview of 10 Conventional Reefer OperatorsMost container ship operators are, to a degree, involved in the transport of reefer boxes, but only a few have a network of services, the suitable capacity and the equipment to be considered a major reefer operator. The top 10 container operators deploy 767 ships in total, with an aggregate 4.33 million TEU and 557,750 reefer plugs, which are deployed in (North-South) relevant trades. As a result of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap, Dynamar expects many old and fuel-hungry conventional reefer ships will be scrapped. For a time at least, both conventional reefer operators and container ship operators will recCargo Space Cooling Arrangements eive a boost from the reduction in trade capacity, helping offset the new higher fuel costs.Direct Expansion Batteries and AirThis is a commonly used system where the refrigerant circulates through batteries enclosed in trunkings or casings. Air from the refrigerated chambers is circulated through the batteries by fans. Its great advantages are economy in space, weight and cost, and also the use of circulated air as the cooling medium or secondary refrigerant. In a large refrigeration system having more than one evaporator, a king solenoid valve should be installed just after the receiver.Preparation of Holds for Loading Refrigerated CargoRefrigerated cargo is loaded on pallets, in bins and cartons. Meat and fish are loaded in the frozen state. Once loaded on board the required temperature must be maintained by the ship’s refrigeration system. 

Stowage of refrigerated cargo:
Chilled meat carcasses are hung from strengthened stiffening members. Sufficient height is provided for proper circulation of air. Frozen meat is stacked in the holds of the ship. Fruits and vegetables are stowed in a spacious area with an adequate flow of air to be maintained around the crates. The refrigerated rooms in general cargo ships are made rectangular to minimise the insulation cost.
Insulation:
Some insulation must be provided at the boundaries of the refrigerated compartments, because of the steel hull structure being a good conductor of heat. For insulating purposes, cork, glass fibre and various foam plastics in sheets or granulated form may be used. Glass fibre is used in modern ships, because of its advantages over other materials. It is very light, vermin-proof, fire-resistant and it will not absorb moisture. On deck and on the tank top, the insulation should be of load-bearing material and thus cork might be preferred. But fibre-glass can be supported by tongue and grooved board linings and wood bearers. The thickness of the insulation depends on the following:The type of material usedThe temperature to be maintained in the compartment.   Lesson SummaryThere are two types of expansion systems: Direct and Indirect (Brine).The main components of the direct expansion refrigeration system are the compressor, oil separator, condenser, filter drier, thermostatic expansion valve (TEV) and evaporator.Vapour Compression System: as shown below have four principal components
- Evaporator
- Compressor
- Condenser
- Expansion ValveRefrigerated cargoes include meat carcasses, carton (packed) meat, fruit, cheese, butter, fish and offal. Ships are specifically designed for their carriage, with separate spaces in holds and ’tween decks, each fitted with suitable insulation and individual control of ventilation.
Frozen cargo is deep-frozen prior to loading and should be at a temperature of 18°C.
Generally, refrigerated cargoes are expensive and perishable. Unless it is ensured that the cargo is loaded in good condition, the ship may have to face heavy cargo damage claims at the discharge port. Therefore inspection of the cargo during loading is very important. 
Brine traps have a dual function. The first function is to prevent the cold air from entering the bilges and freezing the water in the pipes. The other function is to prevent the spreading of bad odour from the bilges into the cold compartments. Module 4 Air Conditioning Systems and Compressors Learning OutcomesUpon the successful completion of this module, you should be able to:Describe the working principle of an air conditioning system.Discuss the use of psychrometric charts in managing the AC system.State the comfort conditions to be maintained in an AC system.Evaluate the air handling system in an AC plant.Identify various component parts in a reciprocating reefer compressor.
Discuss the important issues with respect to the efficiency of a reefer compressor.State the lube oil system of a reciprocating compressor.Describe the functional components of a reefer plant.Air Conditioning SystemsAir conditioning is the process of treating air in an internal environment to establish and maintain the required standards of:The temperature which is controlled by heating or cooling the airHumidity, which is the measure of water vapour in the air and is controlled by adding or removing water vapour from the air (humidification or dehumidification)Cleanliness the quality of air is controlled by
  -Filtration to remove undesirable contaminants or
  -Ventilation for introducing fresh air so as to dilute the contaminants A motion which represents the velocity of the air under circulation and is controlled by the air distributing equipmentFinding the Relative Humidity of AirThe air conditioning system follows the same vapour compression cycle as in the refrigeration system. If the desired temperature has to be maintained is higher, then the evaporating pressure is also higher. 
The expansion valve in the air conditioning refrigerant system will expand the refrigerant to a higher pressure compared to the refrigeration system.
The atmospheric air is treated in the air handling unit. In summer, the cooling coil extracts the heat and humidity from the air.  In winter, the heating coil and humidifier treat the air to the required conditions. The air frosychometric Properties of AirThe dew point of air is reached when the wet-bulb temperature is equal to dry bulb temperature. When air is at its dew point it is at its highest relative humidity. The temperature at which water vapour in the atmosphere begins to condense is called the Dew point temperature. When any object is cooled below the dew point temperature of the air, we can see the formation of sweat on its surface. A glass of water filled with chilled water is an example.
The total heat content of the air or enthalpy of air comprises of the sensible heat and the latent heat. The sensible heat is the heat absorbed or lost during the change in temperature of the air. The latent heat is the heat lost or absorbed during a change in phase of the water vapour present in the air. 
The sensible heat of the air is mainly due to the dry air present in the air. The dry air exists in the superheated condition in the air since it comprises of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and other inert gases that have a very low boiling point or liquefaction point. Since there is no change in the phase of dry air, it has only the sensible heat. When the temperature of the air is changed, it is the temperature of the dry air that changes and it either absorbs or liberates the sensible heat. The water vapour present within the air also absorbs or liberates the sensible heat, but this quantity is very small so it is not taken into account.
The sensible heat of the air: SH = m*0.133*DBT

Where: m is the mass of the dry air, 0.133 is the specific heat of the air in Kcal/kg and DBT is the dry bulb temperature of the air. 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Introduction to Air Conditioning Systems 34 3. Air Conditioning Systems 2 32 4. Refrigeration and AC Compressors 1 38 Lesson SummaryThe term air conditioning most commonly refers to the cooling and dehumidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. In a broader sense, the term can refer to any form of cooling, heating, ventilation or disinfection that modifies the condition of air.
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.
Humidification allows the air to mix with extra water. A sufficient contact time between the air and water will normally result in the air reaching 100% Saturation. The process is very close to the evaporation from a wet bulb. It, therefore, follows a line of constant wet-bulb temperature.
Humidity ratio is the proportion of the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air at the given conditions (DBT, WBT, DPT, RH, etc).Air conditioning systems that use water as the heating or cooling fluid are called all-water or hydronic systems; those that use air are called all-air systems. A system which uses both air and water is called a combination or air-and-water system.
Refrigeration compressors are usually either reciprocating or of the rotary screw displacement type. Positive displacement compressors are more widely used and they are further classified as:
-Reciprocating
-Screw
-Scroll 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Safety in Ref and A/C Systems 76 3. Handling Air and Oil in Ref and A/C 20 4. Oil Contamination in the Refrigeration System 22 5. Testing Compressor Valves 10 Safety Devices on Refrigeration Plant and Compressor Regulations require refrigerated spaces that can be locked from the outside and that cannot be opened from the inside to have an audible alarm, in a manned location. And the pressure relief valve is required in all refrigeration systems for protection purpose.
Safety devices on Refrigeration Plant and Compressor:Liquid Shock Valve on Cylinder Head.Busting Disc on Cylinder Head, between Suction and Discharge manifold.Gas LP cut-out.-- Normally set at a pressure corresponding to 5°C below the lowest expected evaporating gauge reading.Gas HP cut-out.--Normally set at a pressure corresponding to 5°C above the highest expected condensing gauge reading.Lube Oil LP cut-out.--Normally set at 2 bar above crankcase pressure.CW LP cut-out.Relief Valve on Condenser.Safety devices on Refrigeration Plant and CompressorThe purpose of the water failure switch in a refrigeration system is to react to a loss of cooling water by stopping the compressor. If the water failure switch should fail to shut down the refrigeration compressor, the refrigerant pressure will build up in the high-pressure side of the system to the point where the high pressure cut out switch will function. 
The device which normally stops the refrigeration compressor before the relief valve starts to open is the high pressure cut out switch. If the head pressure of a reciprocating refrigeration compressor is excessive-high pressure cut out switch will open before the relief valve opens. High pressure cut out, Low pressure cut out and Relief Valve could be considered to be a safety device, we will look at all the safety devices below.Solenoid ValveA float valve, pos. 2, is fitted on each of the compressors in front of the oil level glass. This makes the oil level in the float house equal to that in the crankcase. 
This can be checked visually in the oil level glass. The float controls a needle valve which opens at a falling oil level, letting the oil flow from the oil vessel, pos. 9, return to the compressor. This ensures a constant oil level in the compressor.
A non-return valve, pos. 10, has been inserted in the pipeline, and this valve opens at a differential pressure of 1 bar. This way the pressure in the oil vessel will be 1 bar higher than the suction pressure in the plant.  ting with UnloaderAt a star-delta start of electric motors, it is often considered necessary to limit the compression work of the machine at the starting moment in order to reduce the starting torque of the electric motor.
Usually, a solenoid valve is used in a by-pass arrangement which - in the starting-up phase - short-circuits the discharge side to the suction side of the compressor. At the same time, a non-return valve must be fitted in the discharge line to the condenser preventing the return flow of discharge gas to the compressor. 
When the electric motor has reached its max. a number of revolutions per minute, a switch takes place from star to delta start.  Indirect Expansion Plants - Cascade System The solenoid valve is closed and the compressor now works under normal conditions.
In a few cases, a delaying relay must be used, keeping the solenoid valve open until the motor has reached its max. a number of revolutions. The delaying relay is set at a delay of 1-2 sec. after a switch from star to delta has taThis is sufficient in order to squeeze the oil through the float valves, pos. 2, without causing foaming in the float valve houses. Solenoid valve, pos. 6, closes whenever the actual compressor stops.

Lesson Summary5. Components of a Reefer System 3 40 6. Lesson Summarydirect Expansion Plants - Brine System Air ConditioningTests for Detecting Refrigerants Leaks - Nitrogen Leak Detector TestAdds a greater degree of clarity to leak detection, though for slightly more cost. With this test, you need to first remove any remaining Freon and pump compressed nitrogen into the refrigeration system. Lesson SummaryFluorocarbons are based on the substances methane or ethane in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms has been replaced by fluorine or chlorine atoms.
The most simple way of detecting a refrigerant leak is by checking the oil leak.
The recovery of refrigerants is necessary to:
 - Prevent the venting of refrigerants to the atmosphere, thereby prevent stratospheric ozone depletion.
- Maintain adequate supplies for service calls after the production bans.
There are three basic methods of refrigerant recovery:
 - Liquid
 - Vapour
 - Push-pullA manifold gauge sets measures refrigerant pressures inside of an air conditioning /refrigeration system.
The main types of manifold gauges are:
 - R410A
-  R22
-  R134a Lesson SummaryOil return is made in the suction collector. The oil present in the suction collector is sucked by the compressors. The pressure drops in the suction pipes, between the compressors and the collector, are not exactly the same.In order to minimize the differences in oil levels of the compressors crankcases, the oil return can be made directly towards the. compressors thanks to the balancing pipe.
Oil has a key function in a refrigeration system because it contributes to ensuring:
- Lubrication of the mobile parts of the compressor
- Evacuation of the heat due to frictions of the mobile parts
- Airtightness between the compression stages in reefer compressors
Defrosting is a method of removal of frost, built-up on evaporator coils. Defrosting should be done before snow thickness exceeds ¼.The reasons for defrosting include:
- Affecting heat transfer properties
- Affecting air flow and circulation
- Liquid back to the compressorMethods of Defrosting are: ( i) Plant stopped and Manual watering (ii) Hot gas circulating (iii) Electric heater.
There are two types of compressor systems; single and multiple compressor systems.
The leaks become audible because the nitrogen is held at a higher pressure than the refrigerant can operate under normal conditions. 
In addition to listening for audible signs of a leak, you will also be watching the gauges to see if pressure changes. In a system without leaks, the pressure will remain constant. A system with a leak will show fluctuations. Safety in refrigerant leak detection:Do not use bare hands to sense for the leak, to avoid frost biteDo leak detection in a well-ventilated areaEvacuate the area, if you smell the pungent odourRepair as soon as possible, if you have detected pungent smell Diploma in Toyota Production System tshingombe fiston 63% Finish your profile XP 42360 Get Your Certificates Your Dashboard Your Achievements Recommended For You Career Ready Plan Affiliate Dashboard Create Resumé enChange Language Account Settings FAQs Logout Course Modules Module 1 Introduction to Toyota Production System 1.

This chapter attempts to compute how much power is required to drive a vehicle and how much energy is required to carry out a trip from one place to another. To do this, we need to understand a few things about the vehicle. The gross weight of the vehicle, that is the weight of the vehicle plus the weight of the passengers, road conditions, and how wind resistance impacts the vehicle. 
To do such calculations, we need to understand the impact Aerodynamic Drag, Rolling Resistance, Uphill Resistance, and Acceleration have on a vehicle.  Aerodynamic DragRolling ResistanceGradient Resistance
 Aerodynamic Drag, or wind resistance, is the force that pushes the car back, or acts against the car, as the car moves forward.
 
 Drag = 1/2*p*Cd*A*v2
p=Air density @27degrees
Cd=drag coefficient
A=Vehicle projected area
v=velocity Vehicle Subsystems 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. The Vehicle Drive - Train 2 3 3. Batteries 3 5Lesson SummaryLeaving aside the vehicle body, tires, suspension system, doors and windows, wipers, mirrors, and interiors, we can define the electrical vehicle's subsystems as The Drive-Train, The Battery, DC to DC Converters, and Auxiliary and Control Unit.An electric vehicle's Drive-Train includes motors, controllers, batteries, and gears. They are the elements that drive the performance of the vehicle. The performance of the vehicle is characterized by Vehicle Torque, Speed and Power.The vehicle's peak power, when the vehicle performs at maximum efficiency for a short period of time, usually 10 to 20 seconds, and the vehicle's continuous (nominal) power, need to be in thermal equilibrium, to avoid the motor from overheating and failing.Gears in all vehicles are used to multiply torque, and thus multiply power. Unlike Internal Combustion Vehicles, which need multiple gears and a changeable gear-box, Electric Vehicles are usually designed to work efficiently with a large range of speeds and torques. Therefore, electric vehicles only need a single fixed gear. Module 4 Storage for Electric Vehicles 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Battery Parameters 3 6 3. Lithium-Ion Batteries 4 9 4. Battery Indicators 3 6 5. Development of Battery Packs 4 5 6. Battery Costs 4Lesson SummaryThe battery in an electric vehicle is composed of cells that are used as a storage tank. In internal combustion engine vehicles, the storage tank is used to store petrol, and the tank itself does not cost very much. In EVs, the battery is a complex unit, it is a storage of electricity, and its costs are high. Also, the battery unit eventually has to be replaced, while a petrol tank will last the life of the vehicle, and the batter unit is much heavier than a petrol tank. The benefit of a battery unit is that it is 4 to 6 times more energy-efficient than petrol and the cost of petrol per km is much higher than the cost of electricity per km.
 Consider a Battery of 48 Volts with a Capacity (C) of 15kWh:Battery Capacity can also be defined by Ampere-hour (Ah): Ah= 1500Wh/48V = 300 Ahor Battery Capacity (C) Battery Voltage * Battery AhThe State of Charge (SoC) of the battery is a measurement of the percentage of battery charged.A C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is discharged relative to its maximum capacity. A 1C rate means that the discharge current will discharge the entire battery or charge the battery in 1 hour.A battery reaches the end of its life (EoL) when it reaches between 70 and 80 percent of its initial Capacity (C) and it can no longer be used for the vehicle because the range of the vehicle decreases. The battery can have a second life and be used in other applications. 4 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Introduction to Battery Pack Design 4 6 3. Mechanical Design 6 8 4. Thermal Design 7 8 5.

Lesson Summary7. Lesson Summary4. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryTo generate energy, an engine needs three things: fuel, air, and an ignition source.The fuel system is in charge of ensuring that the engine has the proper air and fuel ratio for burning.Fuel and air issues are simple to describe but challenging to identify.Some fuel pumps are computer-controlled and have on/off switches, depending on the situation.Instead of drawing gasoline from the engine vacuum like a carburetor does, a fuel injector sprays fuel into the engine.On older engines, the distributor and ignition must be timed to the crankshaft and camshaft positions.In most cars, a coolant is injected into a radiator after running through the engine.When the car is not moving quickly enough to allow air to flow over the radiator, a cooling fan is utilised.The automobile will overheat if the thermostat malfunctions when it is closed or partially closed.Fuel-burning automobiles require a method of transferring heat from the engine to the outside air in order to keep the metal components from scorching.Either you discover a leak on your driveway or the engine begins to overheat are the two ways your cooling system lets you know it needs repair.Most cooling system leaks are difficult Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:Recall what every driver should know in car maintenance.Identify types of cars to help you understand your type of car.Explain how to identify a car's fluids.Discuss how to be prepared for car maintenance.Describe how to check and add engine oil.Explain how the drivetrain works.Outline common drivetrain problems.to fix and should be left to a professional, except for tightening or replacing IntroductionThis topic is intended to introduce you to the basic knowledge that you need to know about car maintenance and how to be prepared for it.

Topics to be covered:What every driver should know.Types of cars.A look under the hood.Identifying car’s fluids.Routine maintenance checks.flexible hoses.What Every Driver Should KnowThis topic contains a lot of advice on how to maintain your car, but not all of it will be relevant to you.
However, there are a few things that every automobile owner and driver should be aware of and equip themselves with. Your mechanic, tyre dealer, emergency roadside assistance provider, and car-savvy friend, want you to be aware of the following when operating any vehicle.1. Know What to do in an EmergencyEven if you have the world's best roadside assistance system or2. Understand How Your Safety Systems WorkWith the addition of features like automatic braking and warning sounds to let you know if you drift out of your lane or if something is in your blind zone, automakers are constantly enhancing the safety of their vehicles.
These functions can be quite useful, but if you are unaware of them or don't understand how they operate, they may activate in a way that makes you feel anxious or confused.

Learn about the safety features of your car so that you are prepared. It's also crucial to comprehend how the passenger restraint systems in your specific vehicle operate, such as seat belts and airbags.
Restrictions on height and distance are crucial, especially for kids.3. Carry Your Owner’s ManualThe owner's manual is a wealth of knowledge regarding your particular car and what to do in an emergency. An owner's manual might not always be included with used autos.

If you don't have one, ask your dealer for one orBeing PreparedThis topic is intended to how to be prepared for car maintenance.
Topics to be covered:What to carry in a car.
Roadside and emergency safety.Avoiding lockout.How to safely raise a car.How to change a tire.How to jump-start a battery.How to check and change a fuse.Jumper Cables or Portable Battery ChargerEven in brand-new cars, dead batteries are a common problem. Larger engines typically have larger batteries and require more power to turn them over. 
The capacity of jumper cable wires increases with their diameter. Purchase a large set of wires if your engine is large. A more compact set is sufficient for a small car. Portable battery chargers are an alternative to jumper cables.
With the help of these gadgets, you can start your car a few times without a running vehicle nearby. Regularly check the charge to ensure that it will be available when you need it.6. Spare FusesA blown fuse is one of the more frequent issues encountered while driving. Make sure the fuses you use match the ones your car has.7. Jack and WrenchFor changing tyres, new cars come equipped with a jack and lug wrench. Make sure you are aware of where these are kept in your car.8. First Aid KitRoadside and Emergency SafetyAccidentsAccidents can happen in many different situations. 
Here are some general recommendations for minor collisions that need you to stop your car.1. Remain CalmAccidents of any size can be chaotic, and even skilled drivers can make errors. Maintain composure, don't lose your cool, and limit the number of times you speak to other people who are involved.2. Secure Yourself And Your Passengers3. Check The Surroundings4. Call Emergency PersonnelThe EngineThis topic is intended to introduce you to the knowledge of engines. 
Topics to be covered:How the engine works.Common engine problems.How to check and add engine oil.How the Engine WorksYour car's engine performs a lot more tasks than just propelling it ahead. It produces power to run pumps that power systems like the air conditioning and power steering as well as electricity for the lights and computer, as well as vacuum for systems like the power brakes.A. Cylinder or Engine BlockThere may be 1 to 16 cylinders in the cylinder block. The combustion is created by each cylinder. The cylinder block is often constructed of iron or aluminium and is intended to withstand the pressures generated when the fuel detonates.Your engine can compress the air and fuel between 8 and 20 times its usual pressure, depending on the engine. All of the spinning parts are contained in the engine block, which has openings for coolant and oil flow. 
The cylinders could be arranged in a straight line, a "V" form, or in opposiHow to change the engine oil.B. Piston and Connecting RodThe cylinder's bottom is formed by the piston. When the explosion happens, it is forced down to turn the crankshaft after being pulled up to compress the fuel to burn it. 
The piston is connected to the crankshaft by the connecting rod.C. CrankshaftThe pistons' movement rotates the crankshaft. The drivetrain, which moves the wheels, and external accessories like the alternator, coolant pump, and air conditioner are all connected to the crankshaft.
The pistons' movement rotates the crankshaft. The drivetrain, which moves the wheels, and external accessories like the alternator, coolant pump, and air conditioner are all connected to the crankshaft.D. ValvesThe valves control how much gasoline and air enter the engine. The valves allow fresh air and fuel to enter the cylinder and allow the burnt gases to exit through the exhaust sLesson SummaryAutomakers are always enhancing the safety of their cars.
Checking your fluids can help avoid future issues, just like checking your tires.Fuel will be saved and needless wear will be avoided by maintaining the proper air pressure. Understand where and how to remove your spare.For information on where components are located in your vehicle, consult your owner's handbook.No matter how minor the collision, you should always call the police.One of the most frequent excuses given for requesting roadside help is locking the keys in the car.To access parts underneath the automobile for several maintenance and repair activities, you must lift your car.
Your car's engine produces electricity to power the computer and lights, as well as a vacuum to power devices like power brakes.Internal leaks and compression issues both contribute to poor engine performance. An engine should be checked for oil after it has run for a while and is warm but not hot.
The drivetrain transmits the rotating force generated by the engine to the wheels. The transmission, often known as a transaxle, is the main part of the drivetrain.The hydraulic pumps in an automatic transmission or transaxle are cooled by a cooler, and if the cooler overheats, the transmission may malfunction.ystem when they are open.How to inspect and change accessory belts5.

Types of Reinforcement TD Metallic and Nonmetallic Coated Rebars 5 5. Corrosion in Prestressed Concrete 2 6. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryWhere steel, or any other material, and concrete must be used to erect infrastructures, their quality is of tremendous importance for a better life service of the said infrastructures, hence the necessity to demand for higher strength and better corrosion resistance materials. 
Therefore, a better quality control of bars, TMT ones in particular, is essential. The TM-Ring test ensures that the quality control is actually effective. However, the crack resistance of TMT bars must be checked before being used to make the shear stirrups. Although stainless steels offer good resistance to corrosion, when used in combination with other steels, make sure that the possible galvanic corrosion is minimal.
There is a plethora of rebars, some of which are worth mentioning, notably:galvanized steel rebars;fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) coated bars;Cement-Polymer-Composite (CPC) coated rebars;Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) rebarses 1 2. Sulphate Attack, Biofouling and Acid Attack 3 3. Frost Attack, Freeze-Thaw and Alkali-Silica Reaction 4 4. Shrinkage and Creep 5 5. Fire Attack, Abrasion and Erosion 4 6. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryUsing good quality concrete is a must if durability must be achieved. Minerals and chemical admixtures can be used to get a quality concrete or covercrete. 

As we understand the mechanisms of sulphate attack, biofouling and biogenic acid attack, we can reduce the susceptibility and effects of these attacks by addressing the factors affecting the degradation of concrete during the design phase. 

It is compulsory to: make good concrete in the beginning;select good materials;have a good mix design; and cure the concrete adequately.Lesson SummaryBefore deciding upon any type of repair, the root-causes of the problems affecting a concrete structure must be determined and addressed to prevent prob 1.

Having found the root-causes of the problems, three types of repairs may be considered:Structural repairCosmetic repair Structural and cosmetic repair After determining the type of repair, it is advised to consider, during the design phase, the behaviour and performance requirements of repair materials. The strategies of any repair must be chosen based oLesson SummaryDurable repair is needed and this can be achieved through surface preparation of concrete and steel. 
It is worthy of note that:Regular shaped repairs must be privileged for they last longer than irregular ones Undercutting beyond depth of rebar is crucial to ensuring strong bond between steel and repairCorroded steel must be cleaned properly to achieve strong bond with repair material Specific tools can ensure better quality work with minimal human resources and turn around time There are various treatments available to protect the steel in concrete from corrosion, namely alkaline slurry protection, cathodic prevention and protection, and electrical insulation. 
In the alkaline slurry protection, the alkaline slurry that is applied to the rebar provides alkaline environment and protects the steel. 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2.

Strengthening is the process of adding capacity to a member or structure (jacketing to increase column capacity). Stabilization is the process of halting a particular unwanted situation from progressing (e.g. grouting to stop settlement).
Concrete structures need strengthening and stabilization because of design faults, damage due to accident, material deterioration, increase in demand (seismic and other loads), etc.
Before designing for strengthening and stabilization, loads must be considered. 


There are two types of designs:Passive strengthening: repairs do not participate in stress sharing until additional loads are applied and/or until acceptable levels of deformation occurs.Active strengthening: repais do immediately participate in stress sharing and additional deformation is unacceptable. 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Injection Grout for Concrete Repair 4 3. Structural Repair of Prestressed Concrete Systems 3 4. Case Studies on Structural Repair 7 5. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryCracks threaten the safety of concrete structures and must be fought against. One way of doing so is grouting. It is a method of filling voids (cracks) in a concrete structure. 
Cracks are common in concrete due to different causes. Some are structural or non-structural, others are dry or leaking, and others still are stable or active. The injection system must be chosen accordingly. Structural crack repairs, whether wet or dry, must restore structural integrity whereas non-structural leaking cracks must be repaired to stop leaks. 
The grouting process is a scientifically designed procedure. It must be strictly followed for effectiveness, and short cuts must be avoided by civil engineers. Where complex situations arise, seek expert advice. 

The types of observed damage in prestressed concrete systems include concrete spalling, exposed prestressing strands, corroded prestressing strands, strands rupture associated with load or impact, and structural cracking (shear, flexural, or longitudinal) Cathodic Protection and Service Life Estimation 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Laboratory and Field Studies 6 3. Service Life Estimation, Part I 3 4. Service Life Estimation, Part II 5 5. Lesson Summary 3Lesson SummaryThe Galvanic Anode Performance (GAP) test can be used to determine the long term performance of the anodes in a very short term.
For quality assessment in the field, you need to know that:Polarised potential (ASTM C876 is not directly applicable)Depolarised potential (100 mV criteria is not a necessary condition)Steel corrosion rate (icoor must be less than 1mA/m2 to be considered as a passive condition)Adequate data collected in the field has proved that properly implemented SACP systems have been effectively protecting structures for about 12 years, and cathodic protection should be considered as a system that helps other repair systems to work effectively, not as a competitor.

As society grapples with increasing challenges at the intersection of mental health and violent behavior, it is crucial for professionals navigating these terrains to be deeply informed, both theoretically and pragmatically. This course delves into the pertinence of understanding this complex interplay, beginning with an exploration of the key findings from the Bureau of Justice Report - Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement from 2011. Armed with this data-driven context, participants will transition into mastering basic initial screening techniques, subsequently diving deep into the intricate relationships between various mental health disorders and the potential for violent behavior.Anchored by robust guiding studies, an exploration into the nuances of psychopathy, and a meticulous understanding of homicide typology, the course offers a comprehensive look into the subject. Moreover, as firearms remain a significant factor in the equation, emphasis on promoting firearm safety with patients becomes paramount, a theme accentuated by scrutinizing firearm availability statistics. By the culmination of this course, participants will possess a sophisticated, multidimensional grasp of Homicide Risk Evaluation and its intrinsic tie to Firearm SafetThe RelevanceAmong U.S. citizens, homicide is still the second leading cause of death (tied with suicide) between the ages of 1-24 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) and between the third to fifth leading cause of death between the ages of 25-44 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) depending on how you split up the age range (25-44 vs. 25-34). The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations; with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher. The Relevance (Contd)In comparison to other high-income nations, overall, Americans are:Seven times more likely to be violently killedTwenty-five times more likely to be violently killed with a gunSix times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gunEight times more likely to commit suicide using a gunTen times more likely to die from a firearm death overall (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).Surge in Gun DeathsUpward Trend in Gun-Related HomicideResource: Additional StatisticsVictim DemographicsIn 2014, the overall rate of death by firearms in the United States was 10.3 per 100,000 people — the same as for death by motor vehicles — with suicides accounting for roughly two out of every three gun-related deaths. 
To illustrate the recent upward trend consider that in the first 200 days of 2014, there were 6,206 gun deaths on record, not counting suicides. Data collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit organization that tracks shootings via media reports and law enforcement records, show that within the first 200 days of 2017, that figure jumped by well over one-third to 8,539 fatalities – representing a 12% surge in gun deaths.Table 1. Highlights from the Bureau of Justice ReportHomicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement, 2011The average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than the rate for whites.The average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than the rate for whites.From 2002 to 2011, young adults ages 18 to 24 had the highest homicide rate of any age group and experienced the greatest rate decline (down 22%) over the 10 years, from 15.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 11.9 in 2011.The rate of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 49% from 1992 to 2011, while the percentage of homicide victims killed by a firearm (67%) remained stable.Large cities with 100,000 or more residents experienced the largest decline (23%) in homicide rates from 2002 to 2011, compared to communities with less than 100,000 residents.From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide incidents involved a single victim. In 2011, 66% of homicides with a single victim involved a firearm, compared to 79% of homicide incidents with multiple victims.Click the button for statistics on ethnicity of male victimshlights from the Bureau of Justice ReportClick the button for statistics on female victimsGuns and the U.S.Evolving Role of Mental Health ProvidersWhat Do Clinicians Need to UnderstandAssessments, Screenings and Guidelines for CliniciansAmerica’s unique gun culture has dire consequences. The U.S. has the most firearms per capita in the world. Despite having only half the population of the other 22 high-income nations combined, data suggests that the U.S. accounts for 82% of all firearm deaths globally, and that the U.S. accounts for 90% of all women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, and 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years who were killed by firearms worldwide (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016). Moreover, while the overall suicide rate in the U.S. is on par with other high-income nations, the gun suicide rate in America is eight times higher (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).Shift in TrendBasic Initial Screening TechniquesWhen patients admit to homicidal ideation, mental health providers ask the following questions to assess risk (Pinard & Pagani, 2001):Is there an identifiable victim - a specific person(s) or a specific location, such as an office building?
Does the patient have a plan? Is the plan rational and lethal? Has there been any progression in planning?Does he or she have access to the intended weapon?Is the victim available, e.g. does the patient have access to him or her?Has the patient taken steps to practice or prepare? For example, if the patient fantasizes about releasing a round of bullets at his previous place of work, has he engaged in any preliminary behaviors such as stalking, obtaining worker schedules, or creating a drawing of the building layout?What, if anything, stops the patient from acting on his or her violent thoughts? Questions like these can help determine if a patient needs to be evaluated in the inpatient setting or if the evaluation can be safely conducted in the outpatient setting.The U.S. Annual Homicide RateGun-Related Homicides in the U.S.Although violent crime rates fell over 50% from 1993 to 2015 (e.g., Gramlich, 2017), the more than two-decade downward trend for violent crime in the U.S. appears to be shifting and rates have been rising in recent years. For example, an estimated 14,827 persons were murdered in the U.S. in 2012 (FBI 1, 2012); a number that while not including “justifiable” homicide, represents a slightly higher homicide rate than the 2011 rate of 4.7 homicides per 100,000 persons that was the lowest homicide rate since 1963 (Smith & Cooper, 2013).Basic Initial Screening Techniques (Contd)Also helpful in evaluating dangerousness are questions that address risk factors for violent behavior (Derefinko et al., 2011; Pinard & Pagani, 2001), such as:Does the patient have a history of violent behavior toward people or animals? Does the patient have a criminal record?Does the patient display problems with impulse control?Has the patient ever been diagnosed with Axis I or Axis II disorders? If so, what disorder(s)?If the patient is prescribed psychopharmacological medications, what are they? Has he or she been taking the medications as prescribed?Is the patient abusing alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescribed medications?If the patient receives services from a primary care physician or psychiatrist, when was he or she last seen?What if any sources or recent events have occurred that might lead to major disappointment or anger?Violent sprees are often preceded by a trigger related to losses or perceived rejections, such as a breakup, being fired from a job, or being rejected for admission into a college or the military (Pinard & Pagani, 2001).
Adjunct consultation with other health providers, such as the patient’s primary care physician, will often provide valuable information about the patient’s prescribed medications, adherence to medications, psychiatric history, medical problems, and family history.Guidelines for CliniciansReasons for Psychiatric EvaluationA history of substance abuse, head injury, or a mental health disorder with the potential for psychotic thinking (e.g. mania, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, delusional disorder, and dementia) may be associated with detriments in self-control and should therefore be considered a strong indicator for immediate psychiatric evaluation. In addition, when a patient has made a direct threat of intent to harm, psychiatric evaluation should be obtained. Forced psychiatric evaluation raises issues related to morality (Bennett et al. 1993) and civil liberties (Testa & West, 2010).Inpatient Psychiatric Evaluation Supervision While EvaluationRestrain or Not to Restrain?Psychiatric AdmissionsConfidentiality and Duty to WarnConfidentiality and Duty to Warn (Contd)oints to Ponder Given the disparities in homicide rates across different demographic groups, how can healthcare professionals ensure they approach these statistics without bias, and provide equitable care and assessment for all patients, regardless of their demographic background?How can mental health professionals effectively balance the need for safety precautions and risk assessments with maintaining trust and therapeutic rapport with their patients, especially when discussing topics as sensitive as violent ideation and firearm accessibility?Considering the U.S. gun culture and the alarming statistics surrounding firearm deaths, how might healthcare professionals address the topic of firearm safety in therapeutic settings without triggering defensiveness or resistance, and promote a dialogue that prioritizes the well-being of the patient and the community?Mental Health and Risk for Violent BehaviorMost people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. This finding is robust even when other risk factors are controlled, such as being male, growing up in a violent neighborhood, and being less educated (Link et al., 1992; Swanson et al., 1990).Personality DisordersPsychological disorders are quite common among violent individuals, especially Cluster B Personality Disorders: Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).  While in most cases the suspicions of individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) provoke only insults and lawsuits, in a small number of cases they can foment violence (Tardiff, 2001). The key DSM 5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for these disorders are summarized in the page titled–Personality DisPersonality Disorders Associated with Risk for ViolenceAntisocial Personality DisorderThrill-seeking, reckless, impulsive, deceitful, irritable, aggressive, irresponsible, violates the law, lacks remorse, and has a history of violence toward animals and/or peopleNarcissistic Personality DisorderHistrionic Personality DisorderBorderline Personality DisorderParanoid Personality DisorderComposite of Personality FeaturesDisturbances of Thoughtorders Associated with Risk for Violence.ersonality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence (Contd)Dangerous Hallucinations Not all hallucinations carry the same risk for violence; some types of hallucinations are associated with a greater risk. Auditory “command” hallucinations that tell the patient to hurt him/herself or hurt another are significantly associated with potential future violence (Barrowcliff & Haddock, 2010). Visual hallucinations can also be dangerous.PTSD PatientsDelusions and ViolenceDelusions and Violence: ExampleViolent Fantasy: What is Normal?
Violent Fantasy: Study FindingsViolent Fantasies: Interpretation by Law Does the law interpret fantasies of harming another as equivalent to a stated threat- thus triggering the need to inform an intended victim? History and Expression Low Threshold for Pedophilic FantasiesMental Health and Violent PreservationGellerman and Suddath (2005) reviewed court decisions on the matter and concluded “…the courts considered the expression of violent fantasies to be an indication that the patients were potentially dangerous, particularly in the context of having a history of violent or threatening behavior (p. 486).” To clarify, providers were not typically held responsible for failing in the duty to warn in the case of violent fantasy without a history of violence. There were some exceptions. Violent Fantasy: Cause for Concernmportant Guiding StudiesThe MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment StudyThe MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was tasked with assembling the current knowledge about violent risk assessment and creating an actuarial model that could successfully predict violence and be developed into a computer-based decision tree for practitioners. 
The MacArthur team interviewed male and female patients (N = 1,136) between the ages of 18 and 40 during an acute civil inpatient hospitalization who had a chart diagnosis of thought or affective disorder, substance abuse, or personality disorder. 
Participants were interviewed at ten-week intervals for one-year post-discharge to evaluate factors related to risk for violence (The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005

MMU and Mapping 1 5. Lesson Summary 3Lesson SummaryThe CPU is probably the most important hardware resource arguably the second most important hardware resource is the memory.
Models for managing memory.
Single Contiguous ModelPartition ModelLimitations of BothIn this model, only one process occupies RAM at a time.
When one process completes, another process is allocated to RAM.
Process memory size is restricted by RAM size.Modern day operation systems do much better in managing memory using two concepts virtual memory and segmentation.  Segmentation, Memory Management and Booting 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Segmentation 1 3. Xv6 Memory Management 1 4. PC Booting 1 5. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryVirtual memory does not split programs into logical modules, instead it splits programs into fixed size blocks. Segmentation splits program into segments that are more logical.
The segment size could range from a few bytes to maximum size (4GB in a 32 bit machine would be max size)
Segmentation can lead to fragmentation – memory space is available but not contiguous.
When address Mapping with Segmentation there would be at least three registers and a Segment descriptor table. That the registers will select form to assign segments to RAM.
When address mapping with segmentation you would have a Segment descriptor table, and at least three registers; Segment selector, offset register and pointer to descriptor table.
An x86 systems memory management is broken into two parts the segmentation and paging. X86 have two descriptor tables local and global stored in memory. The segment descriptor has three parts; base address, limit and access rights.XV6 is an operating system targeted for x86 processor platforms. It was created by MIT for teaching operating system development. XV6 only creates four segments these are Kernel code, kernel data User code, User Data.
Each segment descriptor in x86 system has 64 bits, some of the important attributes of the segment descriptor would be: base, limit, type and privilege level.
XV6 is not the best memory management scheme possible, but reprehensive of what several Operating system do to actually manage memory.
In a xv6 system the entire RAM is mapped into kernel, memory mapped devices are also mapped into kernel space. The kernel, can covert the virtual address to a physical one and do the opposite.MS Office 2013 Transition 3 Course Modules Module 1 Getting Started 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Common Features 1 3.

The lesson also includes the responsibilities and skills of an IT technician.An information technology and business professional who serves as the primary point of contact for IT issues within a company is known as an IT technician. This individual is in charge of computer system installation, repair, and upkeep. 

An IT technician’s responsibilities usually include the following: Image 1: An IT technician ●  Employees, customers, and clients are assisted in troubleshooting and resolving IT-related difficulties.
●  Upgrading systems to guarantee that all computers and other equipment have compatible software.
●  Putting new gear and software in place and configuring it.
●  Inspecting computer hardware for operation and, if necessary, fixing or replacing it
●  To ensure efficiency and avoid downtimes, monitoring the operation of networking equipment and servers is necessary. 5 1Requirements to Be an IT TechnicianThe following are the requirements to be an IT technician:Educational requirement
An associate or Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology, Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, or a related discipline is often required of IT technicians. However, anyone can also take any of the following courses to be an IT technician:

 ●  Level 2 Certificate in ICT Systems Support
 ●  Level 3 Diploma in ICT Professional Competence
 ●  T level for IT Solutions Technicians Requirements to Be an IT TechnicianTraining requirements
While getting a degree, IT workers can learn how to use programming languages to interface with computer systems and troubleshooting strategies. They may also receive a few weeks of on-the-job training to familiarise themselves with the company’s specific software and hardware systems. On the other hand, these technicians are usually expected to have a rudimentary understanding of standard IT products and solutions.Certification
Although IT technicians are not required to be certified, various optional qualifications can improve their employability and broaden their knowledge base. The certifications are:●  CompTIA A+ CertificationCompTIA A+ Certification: For technical support personnel, this certification is the gold standard.●  CompTIA Linux+ Certification●  CompTIA Linux+ Certification Image 2: Graduation These programmes provide students with a broad understanding of programming languages and computer engineering and theoretical and practical knowledge of a widNetwork (Network Technology)Introduction
This lesson introduces you to network technology, which involves using data systems to manage and deliver digital resources over a computer network. In this module, you will also learn the types and connections of the network.Types of NetworksWhen two or more computers can communicate with each other, they form a computer network. Several factors can be used to categorise networks, including the technology used and the network's size. These are the categories used to organise networks based on their size or the physical area they cover, from smallest to largest: Types of NetworksPersonal Area Network (PAN):Local Area Network (LAN):Wireless Mesh Network (WMN):Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):Wide Area Network (WAN):A PAN (Personal Area Network) consists of personal devices such as cell phones and laptop computers communicating at close range. PANs can use wired connections (such as USB or Lightning) or wireless connections (such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, 802.11).Network ConnectionsTo connect to the Internet, a device or a network first needs to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP), such as Xfinity or Spectrum. The most common types of connection for SOHO networks( Single/Small Office/Home Office Network) are cable Internet (cable or cable modem). When connecting to an ISP, know that upload speeds are generally slower than download speeds.Hardware and Operating SystemIntroduction
This lesson introduces you to some external hardware components of a computer system. It also includes a brief overview of the most popular operating systems.What Are IT Systems?IT systems refer to the combination of hardware, software, databases, and communication networks. It also includes telecommunication equipment and internet-related information technology. 
A computer could be literally anything from a desktop to a PDA and might be found anywhere from an office to the inside of a car. We should look at the different types of hardware and operating systems to understand what IT systems are.Interface standards
Interface standards refer to the telecommunications that specify one or more functional or physical features required to allow data to flow between two or more systems, such as communication protocols.
An interface is a boundary where two or more parts communicate. It is a design feature of a piece of equipment that influences or is influenced by a design feature of another system. Early identification anWhat Are IT Systems?USB
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry-standard that specifies cable and connector standards as well as protocols for connecting, communicating, and powering computers, peripherals, and other computers. Image 12: USB For starters, there are six different types of USB plugs:
●  Type A which is the rectangular one we always plug in the wrong way up.
●  Type B, which is the most commonly used for printers.
●  Mini and Micro USBs are used for everything from microphones to Smartphones.
●  Micro-B that you’ll often see on external hard disks; USB-C, which is now becoming far more common, and even variants such as Apple’s Lightning connector.Firewire
Firewire is not very uncommon and was replaced by USB after just a few years. It’s another plug-and-play technology, though like USB, that was largely used for video and Musical equipment, so you might still find it used in some specialist circumstances.d management of external interfaces help identify key product drivers that must be addressed in the system requirements.What Are IT Sytems?Serial
Serial devices, where we typically have a 9-pin male-to-female plug/socket arrangement, are still very popular in specialist industries such as engineering because they allow for analogue data transfer. Image 13: A serial device The following are some characteristics of serial:
●  Serial plugs are capable of transmitting and receiving data at different baud rates (the modulation rate of an electrical signal). This means they are often used in dedicated monitoring roles.
●  Serial devices have to be manually configured as “Legacy” devices on modern computers, as per instructions provided by the hardware manufacturer for the device.
●  This is why engineers tend to get very excited when they see second-hand laptops on sale that have a Serial port built-in.Parallel
A parallel port is an interface that allows a computer to send and receive data across many bundled connections to a peripheral device such as a printer. The Centronics port (which is a printer port) is the most popular parallel port. An old dot-matrix printer hidden in the corner of an office but still in use, must be a parallel deviceProcessors and MemoryIntroduction
This lesson introduces you to the field replaceable units (FRUs), and how to install and upgrade a processor and memory to improve performance.ProcessorsThe electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions is known as the central processing unit (CPU). The processor is an essential part of a computer that interprets most commands; It comprises integrated circuitry (IC) chips and responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer. Types and Characteristics of ProcessorsCache 
A processor’s memory cache inside the processor housing can be an L1 cache (contained on the processor dies), an L2 cache (off the die), and an L3 cache (farther from the core than the L2 cache).

The core
The core of a processor has two arithmetic logic units (ALUs). Multicore processors have two, three, or more cores (called dual-core, triple-core, quad-core, and so forth). Each core can process two threads at once if the feature is enabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.

Intel Processors
The current families of Intel processors for desktops include the Core, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium families of processors. Several different processors are within each family.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
The current AMD desktop processor families are the FX, Phenom, Athlon, and Sempron. Several processors exist within each family. Image 19: A processor Selecting and Installing a ProcessorWe must select a processor that the motherboard supports. Moreover, a board is likely to support several processors that vary in performance and price. The installation process of a processor is given below:
●  Always need to follow the motherboard user guide’s directions and should be careful to protect the board and processor against ESD.
●  Current Intel sockets LGA1150, LGA1155, LGA1366, and LGA775 use a socket lever and socket load plate. 
●  When opening these sockets, we need to lift the socket lever and then the socket load plate, install the processor, and then close the socket. Many AMD sockets have a socket lever but not a socket load plate.Memory TechnologiesDRAM
The cache DRAM, a DRAM (dynamic RAM) with an on-chip cache, is a kind of fabricated RAM. It's a hierarchical RAM with a 1-Mb DRAM for the main memory and an 8-kb SRAM (static RAM) for the cache. It has a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor with a resolution of 1.2 microns. DRAM is stored on DIMMs for desktop computers and SO-DIMMs for laptops. Image 20: A dynamic RAM (DRTypes and Characteristics of ProcessorsThe most important component of the motherboard is the processor or central processing unit.
The two major manufacturers of processors are Intel and AMD. Processors are rated by the processor speed, the socket and chipset the processor can use, processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), multicore rating, how much internal memory cache the processor has, the amount and type of RAM the processor can support, and the computing technologies the processor can use.Data Storage and BackupIntroduction
Data is considered a highly valuable asset for both individuals and organisations. Consequently, it is imperative to possess a dependable and fortified data storage and backup infrastructure to avert data loss and guarantee data accessibility. 
This topic covers data storage and backup fundamentals. It covers internal and external data storage devices, storage capacity and speed, data backup and recovery, backup kinds, backup plans, and data recovery methods.

The reasons why toy models work in polymer physics is because of the results, the simplicity of the scaling laws and their application for such a variety of cases such that many different models will give you the same results. 
If a molecule has a higher stiffness, it will also have a higher value of persistence length. 
In certain polymer theories like the freely jointed model, we often use parameter to characterize the stiffness of the polymer chain. 
There is a better model for the chains that are not really flexible and this is known as the worm-like chain or Kratky-Porod model. 
There are four cases that prevent rotations in chains which are stiff. These are: delocalization of valence electrons, hydrogen bonding between chain segments, strongly charged polyelectrolyte and a bulky side group present on the polymer chain.We cannot do a Tailor expansion if the theta value is large, as it only works when the theta value is small.

Radius of GyrationIn this module you learned: 
As the temperature is raised, the entropy of the system increases, as it will want to go to a higher entropy state. 
The steps to be taken when carrying out simulations are: simulate many chain conformations, compute their Re-squared and take the average.When we are solving for the concentration of any species as a function of a spatial location and time, this is known as the Fick’s law of diffusion.In the Einstein notation, alpha can be a free index (not repeated) or a dummy index (repeated). 
The radius of gyration is one of the quantities that characterize the size of a polymer chain. 
The radiation of gyration tells something directly about the size of a polymer chain.If you want to look at features which are less than 1 micron, the optical microscope will not be enough. In that case you have to make use of what is known as light scattering. 
In a polymer chain, the end to end distance does not reflect the fact that the polymer occupies a certain amount of volume in space. 
Bonded interactions vary with the distance along the contour and non-bonded interactions vary with physical distance. 2. Definition of Excluded Volume 2 2 3. Virial Expansion 2 2 4. Flory Theory for Bad Solvents 2 2 5. Derivation of Fractal Dimension 2 2 6. Gyration Tensor 2 2 7. Lesson SummaryFractal Nature of PolymersIn this module you learned: 
If the attractions are attractive, they want to come together which results in the lowering of energy. If they are repulsive they come together which gives rise to an increase in energy. 
The Flory theory gives us the scaling laws for both the good solvent case and the poor solvent case. 
A two body interaction refers to pairs of segments that come close to each other, while a three body interaction refers to three segments that come close to each other. 
Virial expansion is one of the most common tactics in thermodynamics that is used to look at the interaction between objects. 
Whenever we say that the energy is a sum of the two contributions, we are actually making an approximation that is known as an additivity approximation. 
The three body interaction that we have ignored for the good solvent case, becomes important for the bad solvent case.  
When we are doing the Flory theory for the bad solvent or poor solvent, we do again the approximation that the total energy is additive and we can add the elastic energy and the interaction energy.

Lesson SummarySolution ThermodynamicsIn this module you learned: 
Under the molecular dynamics simulations, we don’t look at the energy of the conformation but, we look at how much force is being experienced by each of the beads using Newton's laws of motion. 
Molecular dynamics simulation captures both static and dynamic properties of chain, whereas the Monte Carlo method does not capture the dynamic behavior, it only captures the static behavior. 
There are also computational advantages of molecular dynamics and one of them is that it can be easily parallelized. 
When defining the volume fraction of solute, we do not refer to the actual volume of molecules but the change in a volume if a molecule is added to a certain volume already present. 
If the phase separation results in a lowering of free energy, the system will phase separate. 
On the other hand if mixing leads to a lowering in free energy the mixing will occur. 
Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane. 
In thermodynamics, the chemical potential of a species is energy that can be absorbed or released due to a change 2Lattice Model of SolutionsIn this module you learned: 
There is no phase separation when f double prime is higher than 0. 
There are two kinds of behaviors that we can have in temperature versus composition space and these are UCST behavior and LCST behavior. 
The classical Hamiltonian is defined in terms of the positions of the constituent particles and their momentum. 
One of the assumptions in the lattice model of solutions is that a solute or a solvent molecule in the system only interacts with its closest neighbors. 
To get the partition function, we simply compute the Boltzmann factors and sum them up. 
The partition function is a generating function for other energy functions. 
The mean field theory is actually an approximation that instead of the different conformations having different energies we assume that all the conformations have a mean energy. 
In the total energy of the system, that energy is composed of solute-solute interactions, solute-solvent interactions and solvent-solvent interactions.Brownian MotionIn this module you learned: 
The motion of the polymer molecules at equilibrium is known as the Brownian motion. 
Molecules within a block do not quite move in the direction of the force being applied, they actually have what is known as diffusive motion and convective motion. 
The motion of molecules is very different compared to the motion of macroscopic objects and the reason why it is different is because the motion at the molecular level is dictated by the kinetic theory or the temperature of the system. 
The temperature of a system is actually a result of the kinetic energy of the molecules. 
The Brownian motion is simply a result of thermal fluctuations which in turn comes from the collision of molecules in the system. 
Fluctuations are not random, they are simply a result of the fact that molecules have different velocities at different times because of the frequent collisions with other molecules in the system. 
There are two different correlation functions that are used to characterize the magnitude of Brownian motion and these are auto correlation function and cross correlation function. 
Time reversal symmetry essentially means that a system looks the same if you reverse the flow of tim 2. Rouse Model - Part 1 2 2 3. Rouse Model – Part 2 2 2 4. Rouse Model - Part 3 1 1 5.

Continuum Mechanics – Part 2 2 2 6. Kuhn’s Theory of Rubber Elasticity 2 2 7. Lesson SummaryContinuum MechanicsIn this module you learned: 
The Stokes approximation or low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, is based on the assumptions that the fluid is incomprehensible and the inertial forces are small. 
Hydrodynamic interactions come from the fact that the force acting on any particular bead, basically results in a flow field around it and that flow field in turn also affects the other particles in the system. 
Continuum really means that we have a very large number of molecules within the system and any variation within the system can be explained by the notion of control volume. 
If the material moves, all the material points also move along the material and therefore the material point is not fixed in space; the material point is fixed to the material itself. 
The stress tensor essentially amounts to the surface force or the force acting on the material point, apart from the body force that is acting on the entire material like gravity. 
The integration over the volume of the derivative, is the integration over the surface of the stress tensor, multiplied by the normal vector. 
The condition of mechanical equilibrium is only true when the inertia and body forces are small, in comparison to the forces because of stress.s 1 2. Elasticity of Polymer Network 2 2 3.

Ultimately the key problem in studying the polymeric system, is not that the equations of motion are not laid out, but that the constitutive equations are difficult to derive. 
One of the ways of characterizing shear thinning and shear thickening behavior, is what is known as the power law model. 
The main concept of Rheology, is to know how the stress versus shear rate profile looks, in the case of liquids and solids and how both of them look, in the case of viscoelastic materials. 
The commercial instrument that is used to measure rheology is called a rheometer. 
The advantage of applying shear by rotation, is that no matter how high the angular velocity, the thickness of the sample can still be the same and we don’t need a very large setup. 
The small amplitude oscillatory shear, has the shear varying with time by an oscillatory function. 
In polymer systems, you do not always have linear elasticity, you can also have nonlinear elasticity.

These properties must be evaluated in order to assess or assure the quality of raw and processed foods. These quality attributes may be evaluated by subjective or sensory methods or objective like instrumental or chemical methods.
Safety is the first requisite of any food. In broad sense, the food safety is taken to mean that a food is free from any harmful chemical or microbiological contaminant at the time of its consumption.

Concept of food safety is used in its operational sense for practical reasons. Few examples include; in the canning industry, the commercial sterility as applied to low acid foods is taken to mean the absence of viable spores of clostridium botulinum.

Some variables need to be controlled during processing and storage operations in order to get the desired quality in the product. The important variables include temperature, time, rate (dT/dt), pH of the ingredients, composition of the product, composition of the gaseous phase and water activity.

Water is an important component of life, next to oxygen. A person can live for a few weeks without food, but it becomes very difficult to live a few days without water. Water is an integral part of all the animal and vegetable tissues. It is the medium through which different cellular reactions take place. Water helps in almost all body processes like digestion, circulation, excretion, etc. It helps in maintaining the electrolyte balance of the body and plays an important role in the maintenance of the body temperature.ng Food Processing 1.

Traditional Food Preservation Technologies - Part 2 5 7. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryBrowning reactions are important phenomena that occur in many foods when they are exposed to different conditions during processing, handling or storage.

Browning reactions are complex reactions which occur when many foods are processed. In some cases, the brown colour developed becomes highly desirable and are intimately associated with a delicious high grade product. For example, in case of coffee, bread and other baked products.
Proteins are macromolecules of great size and complexity. They are of colloidal dimensions, and as such they cannot pass through semipermeable membrane. They are amphoteric in nature; i.e. they behave both as an acid and as a base.
Food proteins are important to texture, colour, flavor, and functional properties of food. Proteins function as buffering agents, emulsifiers, and fat mimetic agents.

There are various factors which influence the denaturation process. These factors may be the physical factors, like temperature, high pressure, irradiation, sound waves, and shear forces etc.
Food preservation techniques have a long history of its use. It was probably first practiced soon after our ancestors developed from hunter gatherer society to initiate primitive farming producing food surpluses and then necessitating extended storage in order to avoid wastage. The earliest used technologies certainly included, for example, drying, curing, fermentation and cooking. Later even simple chemical preservatives, such as burning of sulphur to generate sulphur dioxide to decontaminate fruits prior to its fermentation, were used.Lesson SummaryHigh pressure processing of foods is organized in two parts. In part 1, the process principle and technological aspects of high pressure processing is discussed, whereas in part 2, the effect of high pressure process parameters on food constituents and its quality.
High pressure processing (HPP) is a novel method for non-thermal food processing. It is receiving worldwide attention now and is a new concept as compared to the conventional thermal processes. High pressure processing is also termed as hyperbaric pressure, ultra high pressure, high hydrostatic pressure processing or pascalization, etc.

In HPP, the food is subjected to elevated pressure (up to 900 MPa or 9000 atm) with or without the addition of heat to achieve microbial inactivation, enzymatic inactivation or to alter the food attributes in order to achieve desired qualities.

Depending upon the process applications, in general to extend the shelf life of the food materials, the microorganisms or enzymes or such other causative agents, which result in the spoilage of food need to be destroyed. During optimization of the process, care should be taken so that there will not be any significant change or alteration or reduction in the quality attributes.

During HPP, the confirmation of the macro molecules may change depending upon the process conditions i.e. the pressure and other factors. Small molecules, such as color and flavor, etc. are generally not affected. 1 2. High Pressure Processing of Food - Part 1 6 3. High Pressure Processing of Food - Part 2 5 4.

Lesson SummaryLeasson SummaryIonizing interactions react with an irradiated material by travelling energy to electrons which are thus raised to a high energy or excited state.
If the transferred energy is charged enough, the negatively charged electron can leave a molecule with a result that a +ve ion is formed.
Irradiation creates about one ionization for every two excitations. But, because the ionizations are about a thousand times as likely to cause chemical changes the biological effects caused by the radiations are almost entirely due to this ionization effect.

Radappertization, you can say that it is a radiation sterilization that is complete removal of the microorganisms or biological forms of the causative agents is targeted here.

Irradiation is a called a cold process, it is a cold pasteurization or cold sterilization. It can accomplish the same objective as is done by the thermal pasteurization and sterilization processes.

The food irradiation has very little are no change in the physical appearance of the food, there are no or very minimum or nil textural or color changes in the food; however, there may be some chemical changes into the food and that may if properly not take care of these chemical changes may result into the off flavor, it may result into the softening of the fruits and vegetables or such other problems.Leasson SummaryIonizing interactions react with an irradiated material by travelling energy to electrons which are thus raised to a high energy or excited state.

It is a drying process where the wet product is first frozen to a solid phase and this frozen mass is subsequently dried by sublimation of the ice under reduced pressure. Typically, the freeze dried foods might contain moisture as low as 1 to 3%.

There are two basic steps in the freeze drying process (i) Freezing of the product and (ii) Drying of the frozen mass by sublimation process.

The freeze dyers /freeze drying systems may be classified as pilot or laboratory scale and industrial or large scale freeze dryer. The industrial or large scale freeze dryers may be of multi batch type, continuous freeze dryer or tunnel freeze dryers. The continuous freeze dryers are again classified into two groups, continuous tray freeze dryer or continuous tray-less freeze dryer.

Tunnel freeze dryer are similar to the continuous tray freeze dryer. The frozen food products are loaded in the trolleys which are passed through the vacuum chambers. The chamber is provided with entry gate and exit gate valves, forward vacuum locks, condenser, etc.

Lesson Summary 1Lesson SummaryIn aseptic processing, the design to achieve commercial stability is based on the well-founded principles of thermal bacteriology and integrated effect of time/temperature treatment on spores of microorganisms.
Pre-sterilization of a product usually consists of heating the product to the desired UHT temperature, maintaining this temperature for a given period in order to achieve the desired degree of sterility, with subsequent cooling, usually to ambient temperature and sometimes to an elevated temperature to achieve right viscosity for filling.

Heating and cooling should be performed as rapidly as possible to achieve the best quality, depending upon the nature of the product.

Hurdle technology is the combined use of several preservation methods to make a product shelf-stable, to improve its quality and to provide additional safety to the product. It is also known as “combined method technology”. The spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms are not able to jump over the individual factors, which are applied to the food i.e. the combined factors are generally called hurdles.

Food antimicrobials are chemicals, which are added to or are present in food that retard microbial growth or kill microorganisms. Functions of food antimicrobials are to inhibit or inactivate spoilage microorganisms or pathogens. A number of compounds have been approved by international regulatory agencies.

Lipids are heterogeneous group of naturally occurring substances which are insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform, ether, benzene, hexane, etc.
There are four important processes related to freeze drying. Those are pre freezing, freeze concentration, condensing and defrosting.. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Extraction of Oil: Part 1 6 3. Extraction of Oil: Part 2 5 4. Refining of Oil: Part 1 3 5. Refining of Oil: Part 2 5 6. Modified Fats 5 7. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryFor the extraction of oil from the oil seeds two operations are used. One is the mechanical expression, and another is the solvent extraction. In the mechanical process, there are processes which apply heat; there are processes which do not apply much heat. And accordingly the processes are known as cold pressing or hot pressing.

In the solvent extraction method, organic solvents like hexane, isopropyl alcohol, benzene, etc. or even more safe or green solvents like supercritical carbon dioxide can be used for extraction purposes.
The extraction of oil from oilseeds by means of non-polar solvents is, basically, a process of solid-liquid extraction.
The basic principle of the process is the prepared oil seed is brought into intimate contact or direct contact with a suitable non-polar solvent.

The objectives of the refining process includes the removal of undesirable components from the crude oil like free fatty acids, phospholipids, oxidised products, metal ions, colour pigments and other impurities.
Components also like chlorophyll which imparts green colour or carotenoids which impart reddish or yellowish colour to the oil.
It is basically a physical process where the impurities in the oil particularly those pigments and other related components are removed with the help of an adsorbent. The impurities and the active sites of the adsorbents are attracted to each other by Van der Waal force of attraction. The amount of attraction accordingly will influence the
bleaching efficiency. 2. Rancidity 4 3. Natural Antioxidants 4 4. Microencapsulation: Part 1 5 5. Microencapsulation: Part 2 5 6. Food Nanotechnology 4 Lesson SummaryRancidity is the natural process of decomposition of fats or oils leading to the development of undesirable flavor and odour which is either by hydrolysis or by oxidation. In rancidity by hydrolysis or oxidation, the lipids or fats and
oils degrade to the point of becoming either unpalatable or unhealthy to ingest.

Different causative factors for the rancidity include heat, light, radiation, water, enzymes, even catalysts like metal ions, acids, alkali, salt, etc. These are the conditions or agents to which the foods containing fats and oils or even the individual fats and oils come in direct contact during various operations like heating, frying.

The antioxidants are substances which inhibit or delay the oxidation of a substrate when present at concentrations lower than the oxidising substrate. They are used to counteract the deterioration of stored food products; they function by interfering with the free radical chain reactions and reduce the primary radicals to non-radical species.

Food antioxidants are classified into two major types. They include primary antioxidants or secondary antioxidants. The primary antioxidants are generally phenols, hindered phenols or other miscellaneous compounds. The secondary or synergistic antioxidants include those which are oxygen scavengers, metal chelators and other miscellaneous compounds.

Microencapsulation is a process by which very tiny droplet or particles of liquid or solid materials are surrounded or coated with a continuous film of polymeric material. The particles having diameter between 3-800 μ are known as micro particles or microcapsules or microspheres.1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Respiration & Ripening 5 3. Modified Atmospheric Storage (MAP) 5 4. Active Packaging Technology 6 5. Edible Coating Technology 4 6. Multiproduct Controlled Atmosphere or Modified Atmosphere Storage Unit 5 7. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryThe major processes controlling the fruits and vegetable their shelf life include the respiration and ripening. 
Respiration is a metabolic process that provides the energy for plant biochemical processes. Various substrates used in important metabolic pathways in the plant are formed during respiration. Aerobic respiration consists of oxidative breakdown of organic reserves to simpler molecules, including CO2 and water, with release of energy.

The respiration rate is the rate at which the respiration process is taking place that will influence both the ripening process as well as the shelf life of the fruit or the changes which take place in the fruits and vegetables.

Ripening is a phase in maturation process of fruits and vegetables. As the fruits mature, their tissue undergoes innumerable changes ranging from texture, color, aroma, composition and/or nutritional changes. The terms ripening and maturity are sometimes used alternatively and are regarded as the state when the fresh produce becomes appropriately suitable for harvesting as well as for eating.

Modified atmosphere packaging involves the modification of the headspace gases in a package in order to prolong the shelf life of the product. Modified atmosphere packaging is a technique used to lengthen the shelf-life of processed food products or fresh produce. The packaging allows a control permeation of gases i.e. carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapor. And using a packaging material of suitable characteristics, the modified atmosphere packages are formed. 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Grain Storage 5 3. Ozonation of Food Grains 4 4. Hyper Spectral Imaging for Quality Analysis of Food Grains 4 5. Non-Destructive Methods for Analysis of Grain Quality 5 6. Detection of Spoilage in Grains using Biosensors 5 Lesson SummaryFood grain production in India grew at an average 2% in the last 2 decades, which is higher than the average rate of population growth of 1.5% in the country. Total food grain production in India during 2017-18 was estimated to be 277.49 million tonnes.
There is a need to take appropriate measures to reduce grain losses. To achieve this goal, proper storage conditions should be maintained to minimize the losses. The various factors operating in the total value chain of the grains i.e. starting from harvesting, to the processing and packaging may cause losses.

In stored grain ecosystem, various conditions prevail which include the ambient conditions, conditions inside the storage atmosphere and conditions of the grain.

There are different types of grain storage structures in India; storage structures which are used traditionally as well as scientific storage structure. The grains are generally stored either in bags or in bulk. The major types of structures for storage of grains, include traditional storage structures, improved storage structures, modern storage structures and farm silos.

Different ways by which grains can be disinfested like physical methods, chemical methods as well as biological methods. The physical methods generally are costlier process, biological methods are not very useful for bulk storage of grains, they can be done for small quantity grains.es 1 2. Food Fortification 6 3. Iron Fortified Rice (IFR) 6 4. Nutri Dal and Fortified Noodles 5 5. High Energy RTE Food Paste: Part 1 6 6. High Energy Ready to Eat Food Paste: Part 2 5 7. Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryFortification is the increase of a level of particular nutrient or group of nutrients, particularly micro nutrients in food material to tackle some nutrition related issues.

Fortification is often more cost-effective than other strategies for improving the nutrients content in food.
The fortified foods should be commonly consumed by the target population and linked to energy intake. Fortified food should have a constant consumption pattern with low risk of excess consumption.
Bio-fortification is the process of increasing the density of vitamins and minerals in a crop through conventional plant breeding, or using transgenic techniques, or agronomic practices.

Malnutrition is a major concern for young children and women nowadays and particularly the micronutrient malnutrition. The micronutrients malnutrition is because of the deficiency of various micronutrients, like minerals and vitamins. About more than 30% or over 2 billion of the world’s population is anaemic, mainly due to iron deficiency anaemia, according to WHO report.
There are different means of rice fortification using different forms of micronutrients. Different iron fortificants are the compounds of iron which have the potential to be used as fortificant include iron pyrophosphate, ferrous sulphate, iron-ethylene-diamine tetra acetic acid sodium salt or ferrous fumigate or elemental iron.7.

Lesson SummaryLesson SummaryThe concept about food in earlier days was that the food was being taken as a source of energy and nutrients and the focus was on balanced diet. Nowadays, the food is expected to provide health benefits. The food is taken with an aim to have a weight control in the body, the food is thought to have no chemical additives, it should be fresh and be minimally processed.
Algae is defined as a heterogeneous assemblage of organisms that range in size from tiny cells to giant seaweeds. Algae mostly are photosynthetic species which include eukaryotes and prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, blue green algae and they live in aquatic habitats.

The green algae which is called as chlorophyta, has unicellular and colonial flagellates and the phaeophyta or brown algae is branched and have filamentous thallus.

Dulse is a red species of algae which is sold particularly in Ireland and Atlantic Canada. Chlorella, it is a popular microalgae which has similar nutritional values that of Spirulina and Dulse.

Gluten free products have gained popularity in American markets, European markets and also in India. The gluten is a protein found in cereals like wheat, rye, triticale and barley. It has two protein strands called glutenin and gliadin.

The characteristic protein of wheat makes a wheat an ideal ingredient for preparation of bakery products like bread, pasta, biscuits, etc.

Units Used for Energy MeasurementMankind has throughout history developed countless ways to measure length, weight, temperature, time, energy, pressure, strength, and so on. France developed the Système International d'unites, (S.I. Units) to form one set of co-dependent measurements which is now the accepted worldwide standard for science and engineering.LengthMetre (m)MassKilogram (kg)TimeSecond (sec)TemperatureDegrees Kelvin (K)Electric CurrentAmpere (A)Amount of SubstanceMole (mol)Luminous IntensityCandela (cd)Of critical importance to note is that all other measurements are derived from these seven S.I. units. The basis for all scientific and engineering calculations is using S.I. units. For example, you should not use centimetres or kilometres for complex calculations involving length.

Potential: The energy of a body due to its state (water at the top of a hydroelectric dam)
Chemical: The energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance

Thermal: The energy contained as heat in a body or substance
Nuclear: The energy contained in the mass of matter, which can be released through nuclear fusion or nuclear fission
Other Forms of EnergyChemical EnergyCalorific
ValueChemical ExampleThermal 
EnergyThermal ExampleThe energy contained by a substance due to its chemical bonds, that can be released through a chemical reaction
In practice, the chemical reaction is normally reacting the substance with oxygen, which is burning or combustion.
The chemical energy content of a substance is called its Calorific Value or C.V.
Alternatively, Calorific value can also be stated in kilowatt hours (kWh), a derived S.I. unitTemperature The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object, especially as expressed according to a comparative scale and shown by a thermometer or perceived by touch. Various scales have been developed. The most common are Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin S.I. Unit for temperature is Kelvin:One degree Celsius is the same “size” as one Kelvin.
0 Kelvin = Absolute Zero = -273.15oC


Did you know? When stating temperature in Kelvin we don’t use the term “degrees”.
The Celsius scale was derived before Kelvin, they have been designed so that 1OC change is numerically the same as a change of 1K. Celsius and Kelvin are always 273.15 degrees apart.


0oC is the freezing point of water = 273.15 K
100OC is the boiling point of water = 373.15 K
As temperature scales of Kelvin and Celsius are relative, many S.I. calculations can be done with Celsius when the temperature difference is all that matters.Energy and Power BasicsEnergy TermsThe Basic JouleFlow of Energy Joules (J): The S.I. unit for energy
Megajoules (MJ): One million joules is an S.I. derived unit
Kilowatt-hours (kWh): Standard “unit” of electricity = 3.6MJ – is an S.I. derived unit

The following is a list of other energy terms you might come across. It is good to know what they are, but it is far more important to understand the S.I. units:
- Tonnes of oil equivalent: Energy contained in 1 tonne of crude oil = 41,839 MJ
- Tonnes of TNT: Unit used to measure explosive power
- British Thermal Units (BTU): Old imperial measurementConverting Joules and WattsConversion Formulas The basic unit of electricity is the kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watts of energy flow for one hour.
Remember 1 joule = 1 watt per second
1 kWh = 1000 watts * 3600 (seconds in an hour) = 3,600,000 Joules (3.6 MJ)Practical Energy CalculationsRemember that energy is neither created nor destroyed, but can be changed from one form into another. Therefore the total energy in a system at the start equals the total energy in the system at the end. Energy calculations centre around determining how much energy is used per unit time, what the energy is being converted into.
There are no true energy “losses”. For example, a power station releasing heat may be said to be “losing” energy as heat because it is not all being converted to electricity, but it is still a form of energy as heat – it is not truly “lost”.This example power station converts 60% of the fuel energy into electricity. As electricity is the desired output the plant is said to be 60% efficient. 

20% of the remaining energy goes out the chimney (flue) as heat. 20% of the remaining energy is dispersed through the cooling tower.

How could be plant be more efficient? If you could capture the “waste” heat and put it to use the plant, it would be more efficient.Example CalculationsExample Calculation #1Example Calculation #2“e” and “th” DenotationsExample Calculation #3 A power station burns 15 tonnes of oil per hour, it converts 42% of the energy to electricity, the rest of the energy is released to the atmosphere as heat. 
If the calorific value of the oil is 38 MJ/kg how much electricity does the power station produce in MW?
Energy in = 15 * 1,000 * 38 = 570,000 MJ
Conversion to Electricity = 570,000 * 42% = 239,400 MJ = 239.4 GJ
Conversion to MWh = 239.4 / 3.6 = 66.5 MWh
The plant produces 66.5 MWh per hour, cancelling out the hour terms = 66.5 MWWatts, Joules and Tonnes Conversion Chart
- Calorie: Based on S.I. units, a Calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise 1kg water by 1K (1OC)Specific Heat CapacityEvery substance varies in how its temperature changes when heat is applied as they have a different Specific Heat Capacity (cp). If we add the same amount of energy to a kg of water and a kg of metal, they will raise in temperature by different amounts. We can measure the Specific Heat Capacity and use this in our calculations.
Knowing how much heat is needed to change the temperature of a particular substance is very important in thermodynamics. Specific Heat Capacity (cp) is defined by three measurements energy in, mass, and the change in temperature (delta Kelvin). The cp of a material is defined as J.kg-1. ΔK-1cp (Joules/kg/delta Kelvin)

Water has a cp of 4184 J/kg/ΔK, that means it takes 4184 Joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 Kelvin. Water has one of the highest cp values and is a very useful substance to carry heat, that is why water is used in most heating systems. Below you can find the cp value of some other well known materials. eat Capacity ExampleA boiler is rated at 15kW, if the boiler is used to heat 300 litres of water which starts 20OC. What temperature will the water be in half an hour?We assume the density of water to be 1 kg/litre
Energy produced = 15kW for ½ hour = 7.5kWh
7.5 kWh * 3.6 = 27 MJ = 27,000,000 J
Cp = J/kg/ΔK
ΔK = J/kg/cp
ΔK = 27,000,000/300/4184
ΔK = 21.51
ΔOC = ΔK If the water started off at 20OC then add the 21.51. Final Temperature = 41.51OSpecific Heat CapacityThermal ConductivityK ValueInsulators and ConductorsSpecific Heat ExampleThermal conductivity is the ability of a material to move heat, commonly called the k value.
- Sometimes it's desirable to have a material to move heat fast e.g. from hot water in a radiator to the room, so using a material with a high ability to move heat like metal makes sense.- Sometimes it's desirable to have a material that resists the movement of heat, for example, insulation wrapped around a building to keep the heat in.
The amount of heat that moves depends on three factors:
(1) The materials ability to move heat(2) The difference in temperature from the hot side to the cold side of the material
(3) The thickness of the material
The K value is determined in S.I. units as follows:
K = J/m2/m/ΔK/s = joules of energy flowing / area / thickness of material / temperature difference / secondNote that Joules per second is within the equation, therefore the k value is a value in watts
Materials with high thermal conductivity are called conductors, materials with low thermal conductivity are called insulators.K Value, R Value and U ValueConductivity of MaterialsTotal Heat TransferU Value ExampleExample FormulaExample Solution The k value is the general conductivity of a material measured in J/m2/m/ΔK/s.
R value is the conductivity of a specific piece of a material i.e of a particular thickness, for example, if we have a piece of cotton insulation that is 0.1m thick we can calculate its R value.
R value = k value / thickness
R value = 0.03 / 0.1
R value = 0.3 (J/m2/m/ΔK/s)
In other words, a piece of cotton insulation 0.1m thick will transfer 0.3 Joules of heat from one side to the other for every 1 Kelvin in temperature difference. If we calculate for a 0.12m thick concrete wall with a k value of 1.5 J/m2/m/ΔK/s
R value = 1.5 / 0.12 = 125
We can see that the concrete wall allows far more heat through than the insulationEfficiency and Coefficient of PerformanceThe term “efficiency” in energy is generally used to describe what percentage of input energy is transferred into the useful form of energy desired. Examples would include:Power station taking in 1000 kWh of gas and producing 550 kWh of electricity = 55% efficientBiomass boiler taking in 1000 kWh of woodchip and producing 880 kWh of heat = 88% efficientCar engine taking in 10 kWh of diesel and producing 3 kWh of kinetic energy = 30% efficientCoefficient of Performance (COP) is a term generally used to describe the efficiency of heat pumps. Heat pumps use electricity to extract heat energy from one place, and move that heat to a higher temperature place, elevating the temperature to deliver useful heat, or reducing the temperature to deliver useful chilling. Heat pumps are able to move more heat than was in the original electrical energy. In electrical efficiency terms they are more than 100% efficient. The term used is COP, with input electricity being 1.
Heat pumps can move 2-5 times more heat than the energy in the electricity used to power them. The COP would be determined as 2 or 5 in these situations. Examples include:Fridge using 0.4 kWh electricity to remove 1.6 kWh of heat from food COP = 4.0Heat pump using 10 kWh electricity to deliver 34 kWh of heat to a building COP = 3.4 Lesson SummaryThe main points covered in the module are:Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be changed from one form into another. Heat will always move from a warmer body to a colder body.Mankind has throughout history developed countless ways to measure length, weight, temperature, time, energy, pressure, strength, etc. France developed the Système International d'unites, (S.I. Units) to form one set of co-dependent measurements, this is now the accepted worldwide standard for science and engineering.The five forms of energy are kinetic, potential, chemical, thermal and nuclear.The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object, especially as expressed according to a comparative scale and shown by a thermometer or perceived by touch Symmetrical Components in Three-Phase SystemsLearning OutcomesHaving completed this course, you will be able to:Explain the theory of Charles Fortescue on symmetrical components.Analyse an asymmetrical system by converting the three unbalanced phases into the sum of three balanced phases or symmetrical components.

Lesson Summary 1 Course assessment Lesson SummaryIndoor Air Quality (IAQ) is the nature of air quality inside a building that affects the health and well being of its occupants.
The feeling of illness among the majority of the occupants of a conditioned space is called the "Sick Building Syndrome."
The sources of pollutants in the indoor environment could be volatile organic chemicals, respirable particulates and bioaerosols.
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is a major source of indoor air contamination.
The contaminants can be managed by design that may involve natural and mechanical ventilation and a suitable IAQ management plan.
Natural ventilation involves infiltration and exfiltration of air.
Examples of mechanical ventilators are fans, blowers and HVAC system.
Low emission materials are prescribed by different standards for indoor chemical and pollution source control.
The thermal, visual and acoustic comfort levels within the building should be controllable by occupants.Interior design considerations, such as circulation spaces, indoor plants and ergonomic furniture enhance the health and well-being of the occupants of a building.

Lesson Summary 3Lesson SummaryThe key points from this module are:Start positively by telling trainees what they should do not what they should not do.
The number one thing you can do to really help is to do a practice video interview even if it is with your phone.Get the client to review the video.
The number one thing you should not do is to talk and advice.
Giving people advice on what to say and what not to say in an interview is completely worthless. They may think you smart but then it does not translate into action.
Focus on doing rehearsals and getting clients to tell you what they like and don't like.
The second biggest flaw is wasting time brainstorming on questions and answers without organizing possible message points.
The person preparing for the interview is not helped to process and prioritize messages. Everything is processed in context in this case while in real life, everything may be quoted out of context.If you know a reporter can isolate one idea, you need to help the person preparing for the interview isolate one idea at a time.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module you will be able to:Discuss the basic principles of answering questions in interviewsExplain how to get the client to the point where they are answering questions strategically.Describe how the client can be focused on hitting the messages in every answer without sounding like a robot.Summarize how to work with your clients to come up with sound bites before the interview.Discuss how to practice with the client until they become comfortable with answering questions.Evaluate the client so that you can see their level of assimilation of all the skills you have worked on Module 2 Rehearsing the Interview 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. The Interview 2 1 3. Developing Sound Bites 3 1 4. Rounding Up The Training 3 1 5. Lesson Summary 3Lesson SummaryThe key points from this module are:Give the person you are working with, basic principles of how to answer questions in interviews.
There is a tendency for people to want to be too literal.
Don't spend 30 minutes doing a lengthy interview because the things people do well or poorly, they will do in a couple of minutes.
Conduct the interview, ask questions with the goal of hitting all 3 messages in every answer.
Of all the principles it is the hardest to achieve. The natural reaction is to just answer the question but if you only answer questions you will never hit your messages and you will never accomplish your goal.
The client should get to the point where they are answering questions strategically focused and hitting all the messages in every answer without sounding like a robot.
Most people don't know why they were quoted, erroneously believing it is simply random luck or the bias of the reporter. They have no sense that it is actually the sentence structure of how they put their ideas out.
You have to work with your clients to come up with sound bites. First, check out what they can do on their own. Some are good at it while others suck with no correlation to IQ or intelligence, it is just how their brain works.

Fundamentals of Pedagogy in Montessori Education – Lesson Summary 1What Is Montessori Education? Maria Montessori In an era of information overload and screen-based experiences, Montessori education goes beyond data accumulation to focus on understanding children and adolescents as learners. It emphasizes their cognitive development, sensory experiences, and developing developmental traits.
 
 Montessori education creates environments that align with natural developmental stages, enabling children and adolescents to engage in meaningful work, explore freely, and reflect deeply, fostering a lifelong love of learning.In this method, knowledge is discovered rather than taught, with children exploring and understanding the world through curiosity and interest. Montessori education prioritizes creating learning environments that align with natural developmental stages, allowing children and adolescents to engage in meaningful work, explore freely, and reflect deeply, fostering a lifelong love of learning.
 
This exceptional educational approach was established in 1907 by Maria Montessori, an innovative Italian anthropologist and physician. It was grounded in her practical experiences and observations of children in San Lorenzo, a poverty-stricken area of Rome. Over the past 110 years, educators, researchers, and scientists have refined the Montessori method, which is now practiced across six continents. Nearly 5,000 private and public Montessori schools have adopted this approach in North America alone. 5. Lesson SummaryPedagogy in Montessori EducationThe core of Montessori pedagogy is the belief that every child is born with the inherent potential for success. The adult's role is to create an environment that supports the child's natural desire to learn and develop skills. 
Here, we outline the pedagogy with three main principles:"HELP ME TO DO IT MYSELF" - MARIA MONTESSORI.Active Learning: The Child Is the Driver of Their Education
 
Montessori pedagogy promotes active learning by empowering the child to build knowledge in a well-prepared environment with adult guidance.
With natural self-discipline, the child is free to select their activities, making them more receptive and better able to assimilate new information. The child progresses with the educator’s support, who, after introducing the material and its use, adopts a minimally intrusive role to allow the child to learn through their own experiences.
Respecting Sensitive Periods: Honoring the Child’s Natural Rhythm
 



Learning by Doing: Specialized Equipment in a Conducive EnvironmentFour Key Learning DomainsPedagogy refers to a teaching approach that usually includes a theory of learning and a strategy for applying that philosophy in lesson planning.Teachers are key in Montessori education in providing “freedom within limits.” They offer personalized lessons, select learning materials, and create plans to support each student’s growth, ensuring active engagement without traditional lectures. Every Montessori school tailors its curriculum to the individual needs of its students. However, across all grade levels, lessons fall into four key categories:Math and Science
Language and Reading
Sensorial
Practical Life
 Montessori students learn basic math early, and their skills are reinforced throughout their education. From using counting beads to solving more complex problems, Montessori students often achieve advanced math proficiency by the time they reach elementary school.ow Montessori Boosts Cognitive Development?Key Principles of Montessori PedagogyEarly educational methods significantly impact a child's learning success. Maria Montessori's method, effective in both elementary and higher education, emphasizes natural, spontaneous learning. It fosters emotional stability and independence and enhances self-confidence and concentration through a supportive environment, creative encouragement, and guided teaching.
 
 Higher education promotes curiosity, experimentation, and personalized support, reducing stress. Montessori pedagogy, focused on the child's innate curiosity, supports independent learning through sensory, practical, and language activities, developing cognitive and motor skills. Grounded in strong philosophical and scientific principles, the Montessori method encompasses several key educational principles:Focus on Individual Needs
Each child is recognized as an individual with unique needs, similar to an adult. The child plays a central role in their development.
Recognition of Sensitive Periods Key Principles of Montessori Pedagogy - Page BThe other important principles of Montessori Pedagogy are discussed here.Adjusting Activities 
Emphasis on Sensory Experience 
 Materials and equipment should align with the child’s pace and needs, facilitating better understanding and engagement. Tailored activities help maintain motivation and encourage learning.
Montessori pedagogy fosters emotional stability and tranquillity by providing a secure environment. The calm and orderly setting reduces stress and creates a soothing atmosphere. This approach also highlights autonomy, which fosters responsibility and builds self-confidence. Additionally, it enhances concentration through engaging and stimulating activities.The Concept of Pedagogy in Education As defined by Merriam-Webster, Pedagogy is the “art, science, or profession of teaching,” and involves various elements such as teaching methods, feedback, and assessment. In essence, pedagogy is the study of different teaching strategies.While each educator may have their approach to teaching, they must also consider how to best deliver content and evaluate student learning based on individual needs.Do students require more lectures or time for independent work?What teaching methods are most effective for these students?These are key pedagogical questions for improving student learning outcomes.ching MethodsTeaching pedagogy, or methods of instruction, can be either teacher-centered or student-centered and may involve low-tech or high-tech tools. Teacher-centered learning emphasizes direct instruction, where the teacher lectures and imparts knowledge to students. Assessments in this model measure how well students retain and recall the information presented.Student-Centered Learning 
Low-Tech vs. High-Tech Approaches 
 In contrast, student-centered learning encourages active participation from students. Here, the teacher acts more as a coach or mentor, supporting students as they engage with the material. Assessments, such as formative evaluations, are given more frequently to monitor progress and tend to be more objective.
Conversely, a high-tech, student-centered approach might involve an interactive LMS lesson on trigonometry that adapts to the student's knowledge and provides an engaging learning experience. Each pedagogical method has its benefits and limitations, and combining different approaches can effectively address diverse student needs.Pedagogical Approaches We will discuss the pedagogical approaches to teachinLearning Pedagogy and Multiple IntelligencesUnderstanding learning pedagogy is crucial for addressing how students comprehend information and is as important as teaching pedagogy in supporting individual learning needs. Teachers recognize that each student is unique, so identifying how they learn best can help tailor instruction to their needs.Several theories, including Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, explore how students learn. Gardner’s research examines different learning styles and identifies strengths and challenges for various types of learners. According to this theory, learning can be categorized into three broad types—visual, auditory, and tactile—with nine specific intelligences:Spatial-Visual Intelligence
 Learning Pedagogy and Multiple Intelligences - Page BIn 1987, Neil Fleming introduced the VARK theory, which identifies four learning styles: Visual, Aural (or Auditory), Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic (or Tactile). Like Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, this model provides a framework for understanding and supporting different learning preferences.Intrapersonal Intelligence Logical-Mathematical Intelligence 
Musical Intelligence 
Bodily Kinesthetic Intelligence 
Existential Intelligence Teaching and Learning Pedagogical ApproachesThere are five main pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning, each with its own unique focus. Often, a blend of these approaches is most effective:Constructivist
Collaborative
Inquiry-Based
Integrative
Reflective
 Learning Environment in Montessori EducationDr. Maria Montessori emphasized the importance of the learning environment, referring to the teacher as the 'Director.' She believed that experiences and a positive physical environment are crucial in fostering self-education. Montessori's approach to pedagogy is intentional. It empowers children toward holistic and purposeful development, ensuring they stay connected to their surroundings.In Montessori education, children engage in learning experiences through carefully selected materials designed to guide them from what they know to what they have yet to learn—progressing from the concrete to the abstract.
Practical Life ActivitiesPractical life activities, adaptable to all ages, aim to build self-sufficiency. These simple to complex tasks carry dignity independently, teaching children to follow sequences and meet their needs. Early introduction fosters self-discipline, confidence, and independence, which are essential for lifelong success.The Montessori Curriculum
The first three years of a child's existence provide the groundwork for future growth. The kid is in what Montessori refers to as a "spiritual embryo" and, at this time, does what the embryo did in the physical realm, but in the psychological realm. Events in life mold the brain, creating neural networks or connections that may remain throughout the person's lifetime. From birth to three years old, Montessori education focuses on developing language, coordinated movement, and independence, which gives the child confidence.
There are four main curricular areas for kids in grades three through six regions of operation:Practical Life
Sensorial
Language
Mathematics
 Fostering the Development of Five Key Motor SkillsIn a Montessori preschool, promoting the development of five key motor skills—fine motor, gross motor, hand-eye coordination, balance, and spatial awareness—is essential to fostering children's physical growth and independence through purposeful, hands-on activities.Development of Childhood Five Key Motor SkillsThe activities support children's physical development in a hands-on, engaging way that aligns with Montessori principles.Development of Sensation
Mass Physical Development
One of the primary goals of the curriculum in a Montessori preschool is to help the child develop their senses—visual, tactile, thermogenic, auditory, baric, stereognosis, olfactory, and gustatory. The idea is for the youngster to develop a sense of order by using her senses to categorize her surroundings intentionally and explicitly.
A Montessori preschool, as opposed to a regular preschool, emphasizes the development of the complete child. This encompasses the physical growth of a kid. All preschoolers who follow the Montessori method will leave with the information and abilities needed to develop a sense of autonomy and organization. These abilities include improved gross and fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and sensory development.
Fine Motor Abilities and Hand-Eye Coordination


Fine Motor Skills
These pursuits should care for the individual, others, and their physical surroundings. The youngster is likely familiar with some tasks: mopping, polishing, setting the table, arranging flowers, etc. They also contain "grace and courtesy" actions, characteristics of all civilized individuals.

Through these and other activities, children learn control, coordination of movement, and exploration of their environment. Children gain the ability to finish a task from start to finish and the will, self-control, focus, and self-assurance.The only language people speak flawlessly is the one they learn as infants, when formal teaching isn't yet possibleLearners engage actively in the educational process, devSelf-awareness skills include understanding one’s feelings, values, and thought processes.Skills related to solving puzzles, following maps, and using visual directions.

With natural self-discipline,Montessori pedagogy, focused on the child's innate curiosity, supports independent learning through sensory, practical, and language activities, developing cognitive and motor skills. Student-centered learning encourages active participation from students. Here, the teacher acts more like a coach or mentor, supporting students as they engage with the material. Assessments, such as formative evaluations, are given more frequently to monitor progress.According to Gardner's theory, learning can be categorized into three broad types—visual, auditory, and tactile—with nine specific intelligences.After a teacher-led lesson, students can assess their understanding by working with a peer. This can be useful for students who feel more at ease practising new skills with classmates rather than alone or with the teacher, allowing them to review before attempting homework or assessments independently.One of the primary goals of the curriculum in a Montessori preschool is to help the child develop their senses—visual, tactile, thermogenic, auditory, baric, stereognosis, olfactory, and gustatory. Music supports language development, memory, and concentration, while group music activities enhance communication skills and social interaction.

 In pedagogy, there is a pressing need for educators to be able to bring to light the reactions, responses, decisions, and movements that influence and form their teaching while teaching. When it comes to teaching, a teacher must maintain a delicate balance between what is being taught (subject matter) and how it is being taught (instruction).Critical pedagogy is a teaching philosophy that invites educators to encourage students to critique structures of power and oppression.

Teachers' pedagogic approaches, strategies and practices thus serve to enact the curriculum.Experienced teachers routinize much of their practice, making it habitual and automatic, built on tacit, situated knowledge. Pedagogy Practices Surrounding Dyslexia

You can find equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing both parts by the same number.A fundamental part of geometry is understanding shapes. There are different categories of shapes based on their properties, such as the number of sides, angles, and vertices. The most common shapes are triangles, circles, squares, rectangles, and polygons.

A practical application of exponents can be found in calculating compound interest, which is a function of exponents. In the case of compound interest, the interest is calculated not only on the principal of the loan but also on the accumulated interest in previous periods.The concept of a multiple can be simplified by saying that it is a number that is the result of a product between two numbers.

Describe how vectors, such as velocity and acceleration, are derived. Calculate the unknown values from the known values. Identify Newton's 3 Laws of Motion.The key points from this module are:A vector is something that has a magnitude - or you can kind of view that as a size - and it has a direction. Displacement is a vector quantity. Velocity is the speed of something in a given direction. Acceleration is the change in velocity over time.A scalar only has a magnitude or size. So if someone were to just say "five meters", this is a scalar quantity.Newton's Three Laws of Motion:Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. 
The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force. 
The third law states that for every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.

The displacement is defined as the shortest distance from the starting point to the final point. The total displacement must be determined using the rules defined under the vector addition section.
Speed is a measurement of “how fast”. Speed is defined as the distance travelled by an object per unit of time. Speed is a scalar quantity.Velocity is a measurement of “how fast” and in what direction. It is defined as the rate of change of displacement. (Example: 100 km/hour, East.).Speed is the rate of change of distance with time. As a scalar, it has magnitude only. Average speed is measured over a non-zero time interval. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time. As a vector, it must be stated with both magnitude and direction.Acceleration measures how much velocity changes per unit of time. It is a vector quantity. It is a vector quantity. Acceleration can be positive or negative. 
A body is said to move with uniform acceleration if its velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time.The ratio of the total change in velocity of the object during the motion to the total time taken is the average acceleration of the body.The speed of an object at a given instant of time is called its instantaneous speed. In the case of uniform motion, the instantaneous speed is equal to the uniform speed CLEP Chemistry: Chemical Reactions and Kinetics Course Modules Module 1 Chemical Reactions 1.

Lesson Summary 1 Module 2 Organic Chemistry Module 3 Kinetic Reactions Course assessment Lesson SummaryThe half-reaction method and ion-electron method are used for balancing redox reactions. 
A redox reaction can be broken down into two separate reactions. The oxidation part of the reaction and the reduction part of the reaction.
Chemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one substance to another. This type of reaction is called a reduction-oxidation reaction.
It is important to keep track of the number of electrons being transferred in a redox reaction.Redox reactions are somewhat unique in that the number of electrons lost during oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained during reduction.The redox reaction is said to be spontaneous if the electron transfer occurs without any input of energy.The spontaneity of a redox reaction is determined by the ability of the substances involved in the reaction to be reduced or oxidized.The two electrodes used in the electrolysis are called: anode and cathode. Voltaic cells or otherwise called galvanic cells use the energy produced from spontaneous reactions that occur at anode and cathode to do electric work.The difference between electrolytic cell and voltaic cell is that in electrolysis, external electric energy is used as the driving force for a reaction (both reduction anLesson SummaryOrganic compounds are those that are naturally found in living organisms, such as plants and animals. Organic chemistry may be defined as the study of chemical compounds that contain carbon.
Hydrocarbons are classified into two main categories: Open chain compounds (acyclic or aliphatic compounds) and closed chain or cyclic chain compounds.A saturated hydrocarbon contains ONLY carbon-carbon single bonds. Saturated hydrocarbons are also commonly called alkanes.
Aromatic hydrocarbon contains carbon-carbon bonds that result in a closed ring-like structure.The three main types of isomers are Structural isomers, cis –isomers, trans-isomers.Structural isomers are those compounds that have two or more different structures but the same chemical formula.
The general molecular formula for alkenes is CnH2n, alkynes is CnH2 n - 2. 
Functional groups are also a convenient way to classify organic compounds. There are many other functional groups in addition to double and triple bonds.The carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes and the carbon-carbon triple bond in alkynes are referred to as the functional group of the compound. d oxidation reaction) to occur; whereas, in a voltaic cell, the energy produced from oxidation and reduction reactions is used as driving force to produce electric energy. Lesson SummaryThe rate of a chemical reaction is a function of concentration or pressure if gases are involved.
The rate of a chemical reaction is a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the reactant particles increase their kinetic energy and move faster. The faster movement results in an increase in the number of successful collisions and hence, the reaction rate.
 A catalyst is a substance that can alter the reaction rate without being involved in the reaction. A catalyst increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction path that has lower activation energy.
Some of the key features of catalysts are: A small amount of catalyst will produce a large amount of chemical change, catalysts are specific to a chemical reaction and catalysts do not affect the equilibrium state of a reaction.The half-life of a reaction is defined as the time required for half of the initial reactant to be consumed.
The easiest way to determine the rate law or the order of the reaction is to create three plots which are: Concentration [A] vs. time, the logarithm of concentration [A] vs. time and inverse of concentration [1/A] vs. time.A catalyst does not increase the number of collisions between the reactant particles but only causes more of the collisions to become successful collisions thus, increasing the rate of the

Sous vide means under the vacuum and implies the vacuum-sealing of food in a bag. After the food has been sealed, it is cooked at a precise temperature in a water bath. Sous Vide cooking technique is helpful in cooking food to the desired level of doneness. Why Should Cooking be Done via Sous Vide Method? Traditional cooking methods do not provide chefs with enough temperature control. This often leads to food being overcooked from the outside while remaining almost raw (or undercooked) from the inside. Foods cooked with these methods can become dry and chewy, tasteless, and undesirable for the eaters. In contrast to these traditional cooking methods, Sous Vide provides chefs and cooks with the required control over their cooking. It comprises precise temperature control and circulation to the cook, leading to numerous benefits. How is Sous Vide Beneficial?On this page, we will list some of the major benefits associated with sous vide cooking:It Produces Consistent Results It Enhances Taste of the Food It Reduces Food Waste Flexibility Traditional cooking requires constant supervision from the chef, as their are chances of the food getting overcooked. In contrast, precision cooking with Sous Vide allows chefs to bring their foods to exact temperatures and hold it there without worrying about overcooking

To make the most of your Sous Vide cooking, it is essential to gather all the necessary equipment and utensils beforehand. These utensils include:Souse Vide circulator.Cambro 8-Quart storage counter.Cast iron skillet.Deluxe vacuum sealer.Binder clips.Sous Vide RecipesUntil now, you have received all the important information concerning the Sous Vide method and its various techniques. In this topic, we will how you can use Sous Vide to prepare beef steaks and chicken breasts. Sous Vide SteaksSteaks are one of the basic food items that Sous Vide enthusiasts try their hands on. Undoubtedly, the traditional cooking method can prepare your streak the best way. Yet, there are still high chances of your pricey steak getting burned. The Sous Vide method allows you to cook your steak to your desired doneness level. 
It doesnt matter if you are an experienced Sous Vide chef or not. Setting your cooker's temperature to 130°F or 54°C will give you a medium rare steak. Once you have Sous Vide your steak, place it in a hot cast iron skillet, and you will get a rich crust on the topLesson SummaryCommon Queries Related to Sous Vide TechniqueWhen Should the Meat be Seasoned with Salt: Storing the meat with salt for a long time can alter its texture. If you want to season beef with salt, use salt immediately before or after cooking (and before searing). 
Managing Variable Time Ranges: You can cook your meal above 130°F (or 54°C) for longer hours, as it will not pose any significant health risks. However, you must avoid cooking longer than four hours below 130°F temperature. Addition of Aromatics to Sous Vide Bag: Regarding the addition of aromatics to the Sous Vide bag, you must remember that not everyone will like the concentrated flavors of these spices and herbs. Therefore, you should look for alternatives, such as using garlic powder in place of garlic or adding herbs and aromatics in the pan after searing the meat. Searing the Meat in Sous VidePlace the raw meat in the bag.Make it go through the Sous VIde process.Sear it after the Sous Vide procedure has been dLearning OutcomesUpon completion of this module, you will be able to: Identify the basic muscle physiology with its interior components.Describe the motor unit, regulation of muscular force and firing pattern of muscles in the body. Identify major muscle groups and the microscopic structure of muscle.List different muscle fibre types and identify their distinctive features. Explain the various types of muscle contractions. Examine energy systems, their characteristics and fitness components. Outline how food is converted in energy in the body.

Lesson Summary 2 Module 2 Training Methods Course assessment Lesson SummaryThe key learning points from this module are; A single muscle fibre is a cylindrical, elongated cell. Muscle cells can be extremely short or long. 
Thousands of muscle fibres are wrapped in a thin layer of connective tissue called the perimysium to form a muscle bundle. Groups of muscle bundles that join into a tendon at each end make up a muscle (e.g. biceps muscle).
Components of the muscle cells: The cell membrane, Contractile proteins, The cytosol, Mitochondria, and Capillaries .There are three types of muscles in the body: smooth (intestinal wall and arteries), cardiac, skeletal.
For contraction to occur, a nerve impulse must be sent from the brain. 
The nerve that goes to the muscle is called a MOTOR NEURON. Motor neurons are responsible for stimulating a number of muscle fibres - together they are called a MOTOR UNIT.
Muscles work in pairs. The AGONIST is the working muscle. The ANTAGONIST is the relaxing muscle.
The heart is situated almost dead centre in the middle of the chest.
Heart rate is usually in direct ratio to body size. one Course Modules Module 1 Basic Physiology For Physical Education Module 2 Training Methods 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2.

Training is a cyclical process of tearing down and building up.
Even most untrained body has a built-in reserve capacity to handle a substantial degree of stress, there is a minimum threshold for intensity and duration of stress that must be exceeded before additional adaptations are triggered. This is the minimum training threshold.When designing a training program, specificity is an important component. It is important that the training methods are relevant to the important fitness component and that the exercises within the training methods are specific to the sport. 
The intensity of each training method is important because it governs the energy system being trained.
To achieve continual improvement over time, overload must be incorporated into a training program so that the body is forced to adapt to the new workload.Frequency is the number of training sessions completed each week. In order to achieve a training effect, one must train a minimum of:
2 times/week to maintain levels
3 times/week to improve levels
The minimal length of any training session should be 20Learning OutcomesBy the completion of this module you will be able to:Indicate eleven soft skills.

Implementation of HACCP Food Safety System in the Food Processing Industry 
Learning OutcomesOn completion of this module, you will be able to:Define the food processing industry, its importance and its different sectors.Recognize what is meant by the term food safety and its importance to the food processing industry.Classify the different food safety hazards that might be present in the food processing industry and foods.Describe the preventive nature of the HACCP food safety system in the food processing industry.Distinguish between the two terms “hazard” and “risk” in the control of food safety. Discuss the key terms and definitions used in the foodFood Processing Industry and HACCPFood processing industry is one of the most vital industries worldwide as it derives its importance from the importance of food itself to human life. This industry can be defined as “the type of industries in which agricultural products (either plant- or animal- based) are transformed into food, or in which one form of food is converted into another form of food".  Food industry includes a number of processes and methods that range from simple food processing methods (as in household food manufacturing) to very complicated and high-technology techniques.
Thus, and due to the complexity of processes, methods and techniques that are used in the food manufacturing industry, this industry was classified according to the processing level/extent or according to the type/category of processed foods.  processing industry and food safety disciplines.Classification of Food Processing IndustriesA- Classification according to processing level/extent
Food industries can be classified according to the processing level/extent to the following three sections: Primary foodprocessingSecondary food processingTertiary foodprocessingAt this stage, raw agricultural products are turned into ready to be consumed food (like in case of the cleaning and packaging of harvested fruits) or to be converted into an ingredient that will be used in further food processing steps (like in case of milling wheat grains into flour).Classification of Food Processing IndustriesB- Classification according to the type or category of food:
Another classification of food processing industries is according to the type or category of food being processed that is as follows:Processing of meat, poultry, and fish.Processing of fruits and vegetables.Manufacturing of oil and fats.Manufacturing of milk and dairy products.Manufacturing of grain milling products, starches, and starch products.Manufacturing of bakery and pasta products.Manufacturing of sugar, chocolate, and confectionary.Manufacturing of beverages.Manufacturing of other food products."Food Processing?”Foods are processed for a number of reasons that can be summarized as follows:Processing of foods is a way to guarantee the safety of foods and remove or reduce contamination.Food processing preserves foods, extends their shelf life, and makes food available beyond their harvest season.Food processing makes food edible and more palatable and improves the quality of foods.Food processing offers a greater variety and forms of food and therefore increases the consumer’s choice. In this course, our focus will be on ensuring the safety of foods in the food processing industry as one of the most important quality requirements of food through the application of the HACCP food safety system.Hazard or Risk? 
Hazard and risk are two terms that are commonly used within the discipline of food safety. Although they are different terms, they are closely related to each other as risk cannot be considered without the presence of a hazard, while the effect of a particular hazard can only be studied with regard to the risk. Still need to know more? Let’s see the meaning of each of them... HazardRiskIt is a biological, chemical, or physical factor or agent in food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. In some references, hazards include allergens as the fourth type.Types of Hazards
Food safety hazards occur when food is subjected to harmful agents that cause contamination of the food. Food hazards can be classified into four main groups that are: biological, chemical, physical hazards, and allergens. Please note that in some references, allergens are considered to be included under the chemical hazards type.

On the following pages, we are going to study some common food safety hazards under each category. Biological HazardsBiological food safety hazards simply mean “any living pathogenic organism that can be present or introduced to food, which in turn poses a threat to the consumer's health.” Biological hazards can exist in a number of environments and surrounding areas (air, soil, water,, etc.) in addition to the food itself. Anyway food type and handling conditions are key factors that determine the extent and magnitude of microbial growth. Biological hazards have four main groups, i.e., bacteria, viruses, parasites, and prions. BacteriaVirusesParasitesPrionsBacteria are single-cell microorganisms that live in a wide range of environmental conditions and foods. In the discipline of food safety, we focus on pathogenic bacteria or those with the ability to cause harm to consumers’ health and well-being when present in food. Some examples of pathogenic bacteria are: Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. Chemical HazardsChemical food safety hazards are chemical compounds or substances that, when are present or introduced to food, will have the potential to cause adverse health effects to the consumer. The sources of such hazards are widely varied and can range from chemical hazards that are naturally occurring in food or raw materials, those that are formed during food processing and those that are added during food production or handling.  Naturally occurringIntentionally addedUnintentionally addedEnvironmental contaminants
Food processing-induced chemicalsThese are the toxins produced by plants or animals themselves and the microorganisms that might grow on food. Examples are: mycotoxins (e.g. aflatoxin and ochratoxin), glycoalcaloids (in potatoes for example), marine toxins (like ciguatoxin and Okadaic acid), cyanogenic glycoside (like in case of cassava roots) .. etcScoring of Risk Elements Example for Risk CalculationsSuppose that you are asked to determine the risk of two hazards in a particular food, and after doing the necessary research and studies, you find the following:
Hazard A: It rarely occurs in such food, and if present, it is found to be associated with minimal customer inconvenience.
Hazard B: It occurs sporadically, but if present, it causes the hospitalization of the affected individuals and needs long-term medical treatment.
How would you calculate the risk score?
Answer: What is the Third Element of Risk Assessment?In addition to the likelihood and severity of a particular hazard, sometimes, and where appropriate, we use a third element to determine the risk of such a hazard; this element is the “Frequency of exposure.” The frequency of exposure to a particular hazard is a measure of how much and for how many times a consumer is exposed to a particular hazard. This may vary from an “irregular basis” to a “continuous basis. “ In this case, the risk score can be obtained by multiplying the scores of the three risk elements. Terms and DefinitionsHere we are going to review some key terms and definitions that will be helpful for us throughout the course. These definitions are mainly with reference to Codex Alimentarius Commission (CXC 1-1969, modified 2020.Acceptable level - Allergen cross contact - Cleaning - Competent authority - Contamination 1.

Lesson SummaryThe food processing industry is one of the most important industries worldwide and is defined as “the industry in which agricultural products are transformed into food, or in which one form of food is converted into another form of food. The food processing industry can be classified under three main levels,  i.e.,   primary, secondary, and tertiary food processing.  Food safety is the term used to describe the assurance that food will not cause any adverse health effect to the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use.  HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a risk-based approach that works on the identification of hazards and the classification of food production stages or steps according to their risk level or the extent of threat they might pose to the safety of food.  HACCP system is now the globally recognized food safety system and is the key system to setting up risk-based food regulations based on a sound scientific basis and a systematic approach. Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:Explain what HACCP prerequisite programs are and their importance.Describe the design requirements of food processing establishments.Explain personal hygiene and proper food handling practices in food establishments.Discuss the food safety control aspects within food processing establishments.Describe the assembly and roles of the HACCP team.Discuss the key aspects of food product description and their intended use.Describe the flow diagram of a given food product and its elementHACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)In order to implement the HACCP food safety system in your food processing establishment, three phases have to be applied in a specific order that is:
First phase: Application of HACCP Prerequisite programs (PRPs).
Second phase: Application of HACCP preliminary steps (5 steps).
Third phase: Implementation of HACCP principles (7 Principles). In our training course, we will study, in a step-by-step manner, how to effectively implement each of these three phases in order to have a well-established HACCP food safety system in place.
12. DeviationHACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)Prerequisite Programs (PRPs) are a set of programs that should be in place prior to the application of HACCP in any food production establishment. PRPs are defined by Codex Alimentarius  (CXC 1-1969, modified 2020) as “Programs including Good Hygiene Practices, Good Agricultural Practices, and Good Manufacturing Practices, as well as other practices and procedures such as training and traceability, that establish the basic environmental and operating conditions that set the foundation for implementation of a HACCP system.”  In ISO 22000:2018 standard on Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS), PRPs were defined as the “basic conditions and activities that are necessary within the organization and throughout the food chain to maintain food safety.”

From these definitions, we have seen that PRPs are the basic foundation for the establishment of the HACCP system. Failure (or improper) implementation of PRPs will lead by its turn to failure in the further implementation of the HACCP system.HACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)As we mentioned before, one of the characteristics of HACCP is that it can be applied at any stage of the food production chain, including primary production, food processing, catering, food services, distribution, and retail activities. In this module of our training course, we will focus on the PRPs that are related to the area of the food processing industry.
On the following pages, we are going to review some examples (a non-exhaustive list) of key PRPs that have to be in place prior for the implementation of the HACCP system in the food processing industry. Our study list will include the following elements:1- Building (design, infrastructure, and equipment)
2- Personal hygiene.

3- Cleaning and disinfection.

4- Pest control.

5- Training and competence.

6- Water and air quality.

7- Waste management.

8- Supplier control.
1- Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)The following examples of building requirements should be met at any food processing establishment to ensure a hygienic food processing environment:
• First of all, the risks from the building surrounding areas, potential contamination sources, flooding, water supply, etc. have to be carefully assessed. • When designing the layout of a food processing establishment, strict consideration should be taken to separate the processing areas that are different in their risk level. This separation can be carried out either by physical insulation or by separation in time (like performing cleaning procedures in between different tasks).
• Floors should be non-absorbent, non-slippery, waterproof, and have a suitable slope to facilitate the removal of cleaning water or spilled liquids.
9- Control of operations.Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment) Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)• Hand washing facilities should be positioned at the entry points to food handling areas. Liquid soap and sanitizers should be provided in addition to proper hand drying means such as single-use towels or hot air dryers. The use of cloth towels is prohibited.
• Walls have to be of durable materials, washable, easy to clean, and don’t pose any contamination to foods that are being processed in the establishment. • Sufficient storage facilities should be available for different production inputs and outputs (raw materials, processing aids, processed foods, packaging materials, cleaning chemicals, etc.).• Walls have to be of durable materials, washable, easy to clean, and don’t pose any contamination to foods that are being processed in the establishment.

• Doors should be smooth and made of non-absorbent materials. It is recommended to use automatic or mechanical systems for opening and closing the doors to prevent contamination by touching.• Sufficient storage facilities should be available for different production inputs and outputs (raw materials, processing aids, processed foods, packaging materials, cleaning chemicals, etc.).
• Sufficient and adequate sources of lighting should be available in all areas. Light sources have to be covered to prevent food contamination in case of light bulb breakage.Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)• Toilets or bathrooms shouldn’t open directly to the production or food handling areas in order to prevent cross-contamination.• Staff changing rooms should be available, clean and in good order. Proper separation between working and daily clothes should be in place.

• Devices that are used for measuring, monitoring, or recording, such as thermometers and pH meters, should be kept clean and sanitized. These devices should be available in appropriate numbers and conditions. • Caution should be taken to prevent the different ways of cross-contamination of foods during processing and handling (e.g., contamination from the environment, from the equipment, by raw materials, by tools, and by cleaning chemicals)Personal Hygiene 
• Clean personnel clothing with a minimum number of (or no) pockets has to be in place. No jewelry or accessories are allowed as they might pose a contamination threat to foods. A hair net and beard cover (when applicable) have to be considered too.
• Rooms assigned for eating/drinking and smoking room have to be well separated from food handling areas.• Visits by external persons have to follow the same rules of personal hygiene that applies to food personnel in the establishment.Supplier Control• Consideration should be given not only to the supply of raw materials themselves but also to the supply of food additives, packaging materials, food contact material, and processing aids.
• A strict supply policy containing agreement on specifications (e.g. microbiological criteria) and hygiene assurance and/or requesting quality management system certificates can be taken into account in the extent of details on the PRPs and HACCP plan of the establishment itself.
• In addition to agreements with and potential auditing of the supplier (or what is called a 2nd party audit), a number of factors, including adherence to the agreed delivery period, homogeneity of delivered goods, the accuracy of information added, adequate shelf life or freshness, use of clean and well-equipped transportation, the proper temperature during transport, and long transit times and the awareness level of food hygiene on the part of the driver and other food handlers transporting the food, may provide a good indication of the supplier's dependability. A reception control should address most of these problems. It can be required to be informed of a transport vehicle's prior loads in order to put in place sufficient hygienic measures and reduce the risk of contamination. 
• The supplier's instructions, like "first in, first out" or "first expire, first out" principles, and accessibility to stored foods for inspection from all directions, should all be considered when determining storage conditions at the supplier’s establishment itself.Control of OperationsIncoming raw materials and ingredients :• To ensure that they are clean and acceptable for processing, raw materials or ingredients must be examined, sorted, or handled hygienically and properly.
• In order to verify that only safe, acceptable raw materials or substances are used, laboratory testing should be performed as needed.
• Specifications for raw materials should be determined and used as needed.
• Ingredients and raw materials must be correctly identified and rotated through the stock process.
• Rework materials must be kept in the proper containers and kept in storage settings that will guard against contamination and deterioration. Only materials that pass the prescribed specifications shall be allowed for rework.
• Ingredients and raw materials that have been frozen must be kept frozen. If defrosting is necessary before use, it must be done in a way that avoids contamination and degradation.Control of OperationsPackaging Materials:
Packaging materials must offer sufficient protection for goods to reduce contamination, avoid damage, and allow for correct labeling.
• The packing material's food-contact surface must not present a risk for contaminant migration to the food. • There should be a system for dealing with shattered glass in food or nearby surroundings when packing material is comprised of breakable glass.
• Reusable packaging must be strong enough to endure repeated use and be easy to clean and disinfect. Reusable packaging must also be prevented from endangering the quality and safety of food by using well-established and efficient means.Control of OperationsMicrobiological cross-contamination
Raw, unprocessed food should be effectively separated from processed or ready-to-eat food, either by using physical means or time separation by performing cleaning and, if necessary, disinfection procedures in between different times. • Surfaces, utensils, equipment fixtures, and fittings that come into direct contact with food must be properly cleaned. For raw or unprocessed food and processed food, there must be, when necessary, specific utensils, equipment, and tools for each.
• Access must be limited or controlled in situations where there is a high risk of microbial contamination. If necessary, staff may need to wash their hands and put on clean protective clothing and footwear before entering such places. Access to such areas shall only be permitted through a changing facilityExample SOPs (contd.)

https://alison.com/course/food-safety-good-manufacturing-practices-gmp-in-the-food-induHACCP Preliminary StepsBefore the application of HACCP principles, five preliminary (preparatory) steps have to be conducted; these steps are as follows. Step 1: Assemble HACCP Team and Identify ScopeThe first preliminary step when it comes to the application of the HACCP food safety system in the food industry is the assembly of the HACCP team. The FDA defines the HACCP team as “The group of people who are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the HACCP system within a food manufacturing organization.” This team, which includes all parts of the food industry involved with the product, should include a wide range of specific knowledge and expertise appropriate to the product under consideration, its production (manufacture, storage, and distribution), its consumption, and the associated potential hazards, as well as many higher management levels as possible. This can be accomplished by creating a multidisciplinary team responsible for various operations activities such as production, quality control, storage, maintenance, cleaning, disinfection, etc. It is very important that the HACCP team should have full commitment and support from the management, which should regard itself as the owner of the HACCP plan and, overall, the Food Safety Management System (FSMS).HACCP Team: Expertise and ScopeWhat if the relevant expertise is not available within the food establishment?In this case, other expert sources, including independent experts, trade and industry groups, competent authorities, HACCP literature, and HACCP manuals, should be considered. A well-trained individual with access to such guidance may be able to implement a HACCP System in the establishment. The HACCP team may employ an externally designed generic HACCP plan when appropriate, but it must be adapted to the food operations that are actually implemented in the establishment.
Specialists and technicians within the HACCP team may include:
· Those who are aware of the different food safety hazards (biological, chemical, or physical) associated with a specific product group.
· Those with enough understanding of the hygiene and functioning of the plant processes and equipment.
· Those who are in charge of or closely associated with the technical aspects of processing the food product under consideration.

The HACCP team should determine the scope of the HACCP system as well as any prerequisite programs. The scope should specify which types of foods are being processed within the food establishment and the procedures used as well.What are the Roles of HACCP Team?The HACCP team is characterized by the several and multiple roles that are assigned to its members. It is up to each food establishment to decide whether these roles are assigned to specific team members or whether certain team members can perform multiple tasks. One person may fill some or all of these jobs in a small food business. Thus, and to avoid overlapping responsibilities, it is beneficial to divide the roles within the HACCP team into the following four categories: administrative, technical, operational, and other roles. AdministrativeTechnicalOperationalOther rolesMembers of the administrative group will be in charge of ensuring that the HACCP process is carried out in a logical and well-documented manner. They will usually require a thorough understanding of the HACCP procesThe HACCP Team LeaderThe HACCP team leader is the person specified in the HACCP food safety system to be in charge of managing the HACCP plan and thus should have strong management and communication abilities. He/she should have a solid understanding of HACCP as well as a thorough awareness of the food operations included in the food products that are processed in the establishment and the technical information that supports it. The choice of the person designated as the HACCP team leader can be proven by documenting any relevant training completed (for example, accredited training in the application of HACCP principles), certifications obtained (like relevant qualifications in the area of food science, technology, safety or microbiology), and relevant experience in the field.Role of the HACCP Team LeaderThe role of HACCP team leader can be summarized as follows:Ensuring that the composition of the HACCP team is meeting the requirements for implementing the HACCP food safety system.Making changes to the HACCP team when necessary.Coordination of HACCP team activities and work.Ensuring that the scope of work is achieved.Chairing HACCP team meetings in a smooth and interactive way between members.Ensuring that the established HACCP plan is being implemented properly.Being the representative of the HACCP team before the management.Informing the management of the required time, costs, and personnel for achieving the HACCP plan. Functions and Required Skills in the HACCP TeamThe functions of the HACCP team members in the light of the aforementioned four categories of roles (i.e., administrative, technical, operational, and other) can be described as follows:AdministrativeTechnicalOperationalOtherFunctions:
• Selection of the HACCP team.
• Managing different HACCP processes
• Establishing a HACCP plan.
• Addressing the strong and weak points in the HACCP system work with the aim of improvement.
• Determining the training requirements for HACCP team members.

• Good knowledge of HACCP requirements and processes 
• Strong planning, analysis, and implementation skills.Step 2: Describe product(s)
A complete product description should be created, for example, the origin of ingredients/raw materials which may help recognize certain hazards, relevant safety information such as composition, physical/chemical properties, processing methods/technologies, packaging, durability/shelf life, storage conditions, and method of distribution.   For the purpose of developing the HACCP plan, food businesses with multiple goods may find it useful to categorize items with comparable characteristics and processing stages. Any limits relevant to the food product that has already been established for hazards, such as limits for food additives, regulatory microbiological criteria, maximum allowed veterinary medicine residues, and times and temperatures for heat treatments prescribed by competent authorities, should be considered and accounted for in the HACCP plan.Lesson SummaryPrerequisite Programs (PRPs) are a set of programs that should be in place prior to the application of the HACCP food safety system in any food production establishment.HACCP prerequisite programs include a number of hygienic requirements and practices, amongst which are building design, personal hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, pest control, training /competence, water/air quality, waste management, supplier control, control of operations, transportation, and product information.Without the proper application of PRPs, the application of the HACCP system will not succeed.Standard Operating Procedures, or SOPs, are written practices and procedures that are important to producing safe food. It is essential to have these SOPs in place and to have all food-handling personnel trained to use them.The HACCP team is the group of people who are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the HACCP system within a food manufacturing organization.The HACCP team has administrative, technical, and operational roles in the HACCP systemLearning OutcomesOn completion of this module, you will be able to:List what the seven principles of the HACCP food safety system are.Discuss how to conduct a hazard analysis.Identify the Critical Control Points (CCPs) for a food manufacturing process.Describe what critical limits are and how to identify them.Discuss the importance of monitoring steps within a HACCP food safety system.Describe how to take the necessary corrective actions in case of a system deviation.Distinguish between validation and verification procedures.Describe how to construct a HACCP documentation and record-keeping system.The Seven Principles of HACCPAfter we have completed the preparatory stage of the HACCP food safety system, which included the prerequisite programs (PRPs) and the five preliminary HACCP steps, now comes the time for the implementation of the principles of HACCP. HACCP food safety system has seven principles (steps) that all have to be fully applied in the correct order. These principles are shown below: Principle 1: Conduct a Hazard AnalysisHazard is defined by Codex Alimentarius as any “biological, chemical or physical agent in food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect” (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020). Accordingly, hazard analysis is the term used to describe “the process of collecting and evaluating the information on hazards associated with the food under consideration to decide which are significant and must be addressed in the HACCP plan” this includes the information on hazards identified in raw materials and other ingredients, the food processing environment, and conditions leading to their presence to decide whether or not these are significant hazards. Thus, this principle can be properly implemented by following two sub-steps that are:
• P1A- listing of all relevant and potential hazard


• P1B- Identification of control measuresOn the next pages, we are going to study these principles in detaiConsiderations When Conducting a Hazard Analysis?The following considerations have to be taken by the HACCP team when conducting the hazard analysis:


     • The risk level of the identified hazards by determining the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of hazards and severity of their adverse health effects (please see Module 1 of this course).
     • Evaluation of the presence of identified hazards by using the proper qualitative and/or quantitative methods.
     • The nature of the facility and the equipment used in making the food product.
     • To what extent can pathogenic micro-organisms survive/multiply during the food manufacturing processes and the generation or formation of undesirable chemicals in both intermediate and end products, production line, and the line surrounding environment.
     • Production (or presence) of harmful microbial metabolism products (such as mycotoxins), as well as chemical hazards (including allergens) or physical agents.
     • To what extent can contamination (or recontamination) by any type of hazard (biological, chemical, or physical) occur at any stage of food processing (raw materials, intermediate products, or end products).
     • The intended use and/or probability of product mishandling by potential consumers that result in the food becoming unsafe.Common Sources of Hazards The common sources of hazards (biological, chemical, and physical) in the food manufacturing industry, which are to be considered when conducting a hazard analysis, can be classified according to their sources:Ingredient-related hazardsProcess-related hazardsFacility-related hazardsPeople-related hazards Those are the hazards that arise from the contamination of raw materials and other ingredients that are included in food formulations.On the following pages, we are going to study some examples of the potential sources of biological, chemical, and physical hazards in the food processing industry according to this classification. (Source: FDA Draft Guidance for Industry: Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food, 2018).Sources of Biological HazardsThe following table shows the different sources of contamination and their related biological hazards.Ingredient-relatedProcess-relatedFacility-relatedPeople-relatedBacteria:
• Salmonella spp. (e.g., poultry, produce, nuts)
• E. coli O157:H7 & similar STEC (e.g., ruminant animals, dropped fruit, sprouts)
• Campylobacter spp. (e.g., poultry and raw milk)           • B. cereus (e.g., rice and other grains)
• C. botulinum (spores may be found in soil and on certain root crops.)
• C. perfringens (e.g., spices may come in soil on produce)
• L. monocytogenes (e.g., raw agricultural commodities, other contaminated products used as ingredients)
Parasites:
• Cryptosporidium parvum (contaminated water used as an ingredient)
• Cyclospora cayetanensis (berries)               • Toxoplasma gondii (meat).Sources of Chemical Hazards The following table shows the different sources of contamination and their related chemical hazards.Ingredient-relatedProcess-relatedFacility-related• Pesticide residues on produce raw agricultural commodities
• Drug residues in milk
• Heavy metals in or on produce raw agricultural commodities
• Environmental contaminants (e.g., dioxins)
• Mycotoxins in grains
• Histamine in some aged cheeses
• Radiological hazards in foods from areas after a nuclear accident
• Unapproved food or color additivesSources of Physical HazardsThe following table describes the different sources of contamination and their related physical hazards.Ingredient-relatedFacility-relatedPeople-related• Farm field debris
• Precut, ground, injected, and sliced, items, where metal was not properly controlled by the supplier.
• Farm field debris,
• Packaging materials.5 - Establish Corrective ActionsThe fifth principle of HACCP food safety system is the establishment of corrective actions. Corrective action is defined as “any action taken when a deviation occurs in order to re-establish control, segregate and determine the disposition of the affected product if any and prevent or minimize reoccurrence of the deviation” (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020). Correction, Corrective Actions & Preventive ActionsBefore we proceed to learn more about the corrective actions, we need to differentiate between three terms, i.e., correction, corrective actions and preventive actions.CorrectionCorrective actionPreventive actionA correction means taking action in a timely manner to identify and correct a minor and isolated problem that does not directly impact prodDeviation Procedures
Deviation is defined by Codex Alimentarius as the “failure to meet a critical limit “. Deviation procedures are a set of documented actions that are "predetermined to be taken when a loss of control (deviation) occurs at a CCP". All deviations have to be controlled by taking the necessary actions to eliminate or correct the source or the “root cause” of the deviation and to control all food products that were manufactured during the deviation period. The affected foods during the deviation have to be identified and isolated for further decisions that will be taken by the responsible HACCP team members.Does any deviation require corrective actions to be taken?
Actually, the term “corrective actions” is taken when a deviation occurs from the critical limits at any CCP, but sometimes the action taken is called “process adjustment” which is applied only to the deviations from what is so called “target limits” (without exceeding the critical limits). To be clearer, let’s have a look at the next example.uct safety.As applies for each identified CCP, corrective actions have to be considered and planned before the deviation from critical limits takes place. This will enable the HACCP teCorrective Actions or Process Adjustments?
Example:
In the production of pasteurized milk, a critical limit for the heat treatment was set to be 75oC, but under practical conditions, if we adjust the heaters’ temperature to achieve 75oC accurate, the situation will be subjected to deviation from the critical limit if any small decrease occurred in the treatment temperature,  ow to Conduct Corrective Actions?Corrective actions can be conducted through the following steps:
1- Identification and correction of the cause of deviation or non-compliance; 

2-Determination the disposition of non-compliant products (foods manufactured during the deviation period).

3- Documentation of the corrective actions that have been taken. Dealing With Affected Food Products?In general, there are three ways that can be used to deal with the affected food products that were manufactured during the periods of deviation from the critical limits at a CCP. These ways are: reprocessing, diversion or destruction.ReprocessingDiversionDestructionIn this case, food products that didn’t meet the required CCP condition are reprocessed again after the corrective actions are taken to eliminate the cause of deviation.
Example 1: Monitoring detected that the amount of preservative added to food is less than the required percentage (0.07%). Action taken: correct the cause, adjust the amount of added preservative and then reprocess the food.
Example 2: Monitoring detected that juice didn’t reach the required temperature during the heat treatment. Action: correct the cause, fix the temperature as required and re-pasteurize the affected juice batches.N.B. The corrective actions taken have to ensure that the CCP conditions have been brought once again under control. Moreover, food that is potentially unsafe (was produced during the deviation period) has to be handled appropriately to avoid its contact with other safe foods in the establishment, and that it does not reach consumers.
Actions taken should include segregating the affected product and analyzing its safety to ensure proper disposition.
Thus, and in order to overcome this issue, another limit is set to be more stringent than the critical limit values which is called target or (operational) limit (80 oC as shown in this example). This will provide food manufacturers with extra assurances that the minimum temperature will be consistently achieved and that any small decrease occurs around the target limit (for up to 4 degrees) will not result in a deviation in the critical limits. In other words, target limits are used to provide a safety margin to allow extra time to fix the process before the critical limits are being deviated.am to promptly and properly take the necessary and required actions.
What to be included in the corrective actions?
When establishing corrective actions, the following information has to be recorded and to be available.
• Who is responsible for conducting the corrective actions?
• How and what type of corrective action are to be taken?
• What to do with the foods products that were manufactured during the deviation period?
• Keeping records of the actions taken with the relevant information like date, time, actions taken .
• Pits or pit fragments, shells.
Viruses:
• Norovirus (produce, shellfish)        • Hepatitis A virus (produce, fruits).6- Validation of HACCP Plan & Procedures A- Validation of the HACCP plan Before the HACCP team starts to implement the HACCP plan in their food processing establishment, they have to ensure that the elements of planned HACCP food safety system are capable of effectively and adequately controlling the food safety hazards (biological, chemical and physical) that are related to their food products. 
These elements include: • Identification and evaluation of food safety hazards.
• Control measures.
• Identification of critical control points
• Setting the proper critical limits.
• Frequency and type of monitoring procedures at each CCPs.
• Corrective actions taken when deviation occurs.
• Frequency and type of verification.
• The adequacy and efficacy of the documentation system.Validation of he Control MeasuresValidation of HACCP control measures can be defined as “obtaining evidence that a control measure or combination of control measures, if properly implemented, is capable of controlling the hazard to a specified outcome " (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020)”. This validation is carried out during the development of HACCP plan and prior to its implementation. Validation is basically a scientific-based process and the obtained evidences should be scientifically correct and sound.Sources for control measures validation may include:


• Relevant regulations and standards.
• Scientific and technical literature.
• Laboratory testing (like process conditions-mimic testing).
• Mathematical modeling (like kinetic modeling of bacterial growth).
• Surveys.
• Expert advice.N.B. In some cases, the situation requires to perform what is called subsequent validation (or revalidation). Examples for such cases are: system failure, a significant change in product or process, the recognition of new hazards and new regulatory or scientific informationWhat About Verification?B- Verification ProceduresImmediately after HACCP food safety system is put into place and is being implemented, procedures should be established to ensure the system is operating efficiently, or in other words, to ensure that the system is functioning as planned. Thus, verification can be defined as “the application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addition to monitoring, to determine whether a control measure is or has been operating as intended”. 
Following is a list of some verification activities:• Ensuring that control measures are in place and that they are in accordance with the HACCP plan.
• Reviewing the whole HACCP system to ensure that it is operating as planned.
• Confirmation that CCPs are under control by reviewing the monitoring records.
• Review of undertaken corrective actions in case of deviations from critical limits.
• Review of calibration procedures and records to ensure the accuracy of devices used for of CCPs.
• Sampling and testing the different raw materials, operations, environment and food products for different food safety hazards.
• Review of modifications of the HACCP plan.Validation, Verification and MonitoringThe difference between three terms “validation”, “verification” and “monitoring” is a source of confusion for many food specialists and technicians. Following is an example to help you distinguish between these different terms:Example: 
The pasteurization step is the principal treatment in the processing of pasteurized bottle milk. Pasteurization is a microbiocidal heat treatment aimed at reducing the number of any pathogenic microorganisms in milk and liquid milk products, if present, to a level at which they do not constitute a significant health hazard. Pasteurization conditions are designed to effectively destroy the organisms Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnettii. This step is the only treatment that is designed specifically to control the pathogenic bacteria; thus, it is considered as a CCP in the processing of this product. 
A table describing the difference between the aforementioned three terms applied to this step is shown on the next page.Practical HACCPIn this topic, we are going to learn how to practically implement the HACCP preliminary steps and principles and how to make the necessary documents for each. We preferred to include different examples from a collection of food processing industry types to ensure that trainees will acquire knowledge in the application of the HACCP food safety systems in various areas of the food processing industry. So, we will study how to construct and perform the following tasks:Assemble the HACCP teamProduct description and intended useConstruction of flow diagramConduct a hazard analysisIdentification of critical control points (CCPs)Establish critical limits at each CCPMonitoring activitiesCorrective actionVerification proceduresAssembling the HACCP Team (Example)This is an example of a HACCP team structure in a food processing establishment. In this case, the HACCP team consists of seven people; the team leader, secretary, four members, and one external consultant. Please note that the number of the HACCP team depends on many factors, such as the size of the establishment and the nature of processed foods. HACCP WorksheetProduct Description and Intended Use (Example)This is an example of a product description of a food product (Sliced wheat bread). The format used to describe this product is the common one recommended by FDA, which includes the following information:
Product name, description (including important food safety characteristics), ingredients, packaging type, intended use and consumers, shelf life, labeling instructions (related to safety), and storage and distribution aspects. Lesson SummaryHACCP food safety system includes the application of seven principles.Hazard analysis is the term used to describe “the process of collecting and evaluating the information on hazards associated with the food under consideration to decide which are significant and must be addressed in the HACCP plan.”Hazard analysis includes the listing of all relevant and potential hazards and the Identification of control measures.Control measures are those actions or activities that can prevent, eliminate, or minimize the impact or the probability of occurrence of hazards to acceptable levels.A critical control point (CCP) is defined as “A step at which a control measure or control measures, essential to control a significant hazard, is/are applied in a HACCP system.”Critical control points can be identified by using deci Course Modules Module 1 Interrogations and Confessions 1.

Lesson Summary 2 Course assessment sion trees or any other relevant methods like a risk matrix.Critical limits are “A criterion, observable or measurable, relating to a control measure at a CCP which separates acceptability from unacceptability of the food.”Criminal Psychology: Confession and Interrogation Lesson SummaryThe key contents covered in the module are the following: The Reid technique of interrogation construes interrogation as the psychological undoing of deception.The tactics of effective interrogation are dependent upon the interrogator coming across as confident and fully knowledgeable about the case.The three main ways in which an interrogator confronts a suspect are direct accusation, evidence strategy and supported direct accusation.The most common tactic of the interview involves the police officer pointing to a contradiction or an inconsistency in the suspect’s statement.The presence of a solicitor and previous prison experience markedly reduces the likelihood of suspects’ confessing.In April 1995, the detainees’ right to silence was modified under sections 34 and 37 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The middle sentence of the current police caution warns of possible adverse inference of the detainees’ right to silence.The three categories of interview tactics are delivery, maximisation and manipulation.The impact of interview tactics can be determined from the responses of the interviewee and the observations and evaluation of the behavioural symptoms throughout the interview process.

Transport Management System (TMS) - A Transportation Management System (TMS) is a subset of Supply Chain Management (SCM) that deals with the planning, execution and optimization of the physical movement of goods.

TMS is a platform that is designed to streamline the shipping process. It is offered as a module within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and SCM suites that help organizations move inbound – procurement – and outbound – shipment – freight using tools like route planning and optimization, yard management, carrier management, etc.TMS handles four important operations of transport management:

During redox reactions, one of the reactants oxidises (it loses electrons), and the other is reduced (it gains electrons).
Another, more specific definition of redox reactions involves the transfer of oxygen and hydrogen between chemical species. The following are some examples of redox reactions: Iron rusts, forming iron oxides. Metal corrosion (iron rust) is caused by oxygen in water, oxidising iron into oxides.Combustion reactions: The combustion reactions are redox reactions in which hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water.Respiration: Redox reactions convert the food we consume into energy.Photosynthesis: The reaction between water and carbon dioxide to give glucose and oxygen is a redox reaction in which water becomes oxidised, and carbon dioxide becomes reduced.Usually, metals to the left of the periodic table oxidise by losing electrons, and nonmetals to the right reduce by gaining electrons.

Remember
    • The oxidation state of elements is equal to zero. Example: oxidation state of Cl2, Al, and Mg = 0.
    • Manganese change oxidation state from +7 (MnO4− ) to +2 (Mn2+)ElectrolysisThe electrolysis cell is an electrochemical cell that employs an electric source to force a chemical reaction. Some pure elements are often extracted from their compounds using this method. Typically, some of these elements are metals at the top of the reactivity series that cannot be extracted from their ores when heated with carbon. It is also used to prepare nonmetals such as chlorine gas and in electroplating. The electrolysis cell is used to prepare chlorine ga
The full oxidation equation is:
             5Cu + 2KMnO4 + 8H2SO4 → 5CuSO4 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4+ 8H2OThe Chemical Reactivity SeriesWe list elements in the chemical reactivity series in decreasing order of chemical reactivity. Elements at the top of the chemical reactivity series replace lower elements. Electrolysis Cell CompositionThe electrolysis cell consists of two electrodes (conductive metals or carbon) connected to a power supply and dipped in an electrolyte. The negative wire of the power supply connects to the cathode and the positive to the anode. 
Usually, the anode is where negative ions lose electrons, and the cathode is where positive ions reduce to their elements. Redox Reactions in the Electrolysis CellElectrolytes are prepared by dissolving metal salts in water or by melting salts.
Salts dissociate in water into positive and negative ions (cations and anions). For example, copper (II) sulfate electrolyte (CuSO4) dissociates into Cu2+ ions (cations) and SO42- ions (anions). Zinc (II) chloride dissociates into Zn2+ ions, and Cl− is another electrolyte used in electrolysis cells.Silver Chloride (AgCl)Reaction at the anode (loss of electrons)
Reaction at the cathode (gain of electrons)
Oxidation happens at the anode.
For example:
The electrolyte silver chloride (AgCl) electrolyte dissociates into Ag+ and Cl− ions.
At the anode, chloride ions lose electrons and change into chlorine gas (oxidise).
2Cl−→ Cl2 + 2e−
Another reaction occurs at the anode.
Silver chloride is dissolved in water; the waterNotes About the Electrolysis CellAt the anode, anions lose electrons (oxidised). At the cathode, cations gain electrons (reduced).Ionic compounds used in electrolysis cells are either salts dissolved in water or molten salts to allow ions to move freely (ions in a solid state don’t move).The chemical reaction is driven by an external electrical source (a battery).The redox reaction is forced by electrical energy (not spontaneously).Redox reactions occur in the same container. Both electrodes are placed in a single container.Electrons move from the anode to the cathode.Ions discharge at both electrodes. Positively charged ions move to the cathode, whereas negatively charged ions move to the anode.The electrodes used in electrolysis cells must conduct electricity for the electrons to pass and for the redox reactions to occur.Although graphite is a non-metal, it is used as an electrode because it has delocalised electrons that conduct electricity.Due to graphite's high melting point, graphite electrodes do not melt in molten salts. (graphite forms giant molecular structures held together by strong covalent bonds).Negative ions (anions) are attracted to the anode because the anode is connected to the positive pole of the power supply (+ve).Positive ions (cations) are attracted to the cathode because the cathode is connected to the negative pole of the power supply (−ve). itself is hydrolysed due to the passing current.Electrolysis Cell - ExamplesExample 1 Example 1:

The oxidation reaction at the anode



Example 2

Cu and H2 at the cathodeQuantitative Electrolysis
We have seen that electrolysis results in metal deposits at the cathode. It is critical to understand the amount of current and time required to obtain a specific mass of an element during the manufacturing of metals such as aluminium.The mass of the produced substance is proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through the electrodes in coulombs. 
The deposited mass is proportional to the current strength and the time it takes to pass. 
 4OH−→ O2 + 2H2O + 4e−Charge, Current & Time TriangleWe can express the relation between charge and current using charge, current & time triangle
We usually use Faraday (F) to express the quantity of electricity carried by one mole of electrons. 
                                                              
                         1 Faraday = 96500 Coulombs
This means one mole of electrons carries a quantity of electricity equal to 96500 coulombs. Example 1

In the silver chloride (AgCl) example.
We need 1 F (96500 C) of electricity to deposit one mole of silver. Quantitative Electrolysis - ExerciseExercise 1SolutionTo obtain 2 mole of aluminiumTo obtain 1 mol. of aluminiumExercise 1:

(1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3 at r.t.p.)
Given 
Current (I) = 1.70 A
Time (T) = 70.0 minCalculating the Avogadro Constant 
Calculating the Avogadro constant by an electrolytic methodWe talked in the Beginner Chemistry: Mole Calculations & Chemical Bonds Course about Avogadro’s constant and that it is the number of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) found in one mole of a substance.One mole of a substance = Avogadro’s number “L” (6.02 x 1023 atoms, molecules, or ions).
Likewise, one mole of electrons contains the same number of electrons.
One mole of electrons = Avogadro’s number (6.02 x 1023 electrons).
We can use electrolysis to find the charge associated with one mole of electrons. Avogadro Constant (Recap)One mole of any element contains the same number of atoms (6.02 x 1023 atoms), but they differ in their masses (due to the difference in the number of protons, and neutrons).
To understand Avogadro's constant, think of apples and oranges. If you compare five apples to five oranges, you will find they have the same number but weigh differently.  The weight of 5 oranges is different from the weight of 5 apples.Similarly, one mole of iron (Fe) contains the same number of atoms as one mole of sodium (Na) (each contains 6.02 x 1023 atoms), but the mass of one mole of iron is 55.847 grams, and the mass of one mole of sodium is 23 grams
1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3Lesson SummaryRedox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between species. During redox reactions, one species is reduced, and the other is oxidised.Examples of redox reactions are iron rust, combustion reactions, and photosynthesis.The oxidation number of an element is zero.The reducing agent is an electron donor (reduces other species). It oxidises during a chemical reaction.The oxidising agent is an electron acceptor (it oxidises other species). It reduces during a chemical reaction.Redox reactions are divided into two types of reactions: oxidation and reduction reactions.Oxidation increases the oxidation number of a species (more positive or less negative), and reduction makes the oxidation number less positive (or more negative).Electrolysis is a chemical reaction influenced by a passing current.An electrolysis cell is an electrochemical cell that uses an electric source to force a chemical reaction.Electrochemical reactivity series is a list of elements arranged in order of decreasing their reactivity.An electrolysis cell comprises two connected conductive electrodes (metal or carbon) immersed in an aqueous salt solution or molten salt.The anode is connected to the positive pole of the electric source. Electrons are attracted to the anode.In an electrolysis cell, the cathode is connected to theLearning OutcomesBy the end of this module, you will be able to:Define standard electrode potential, redox equilibrium and half-cellExplain how to write the oxidation-reduction reaction and the half-cellDescribe how to use a reference electrode to measure the electrode potential of a half-cell

Copper metal is oxidised to copper ions.
                    Cu(s) → Cu2+ + 2e−Reduction reaction
Copper ions are reduced to copper metal.
                    Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu(s)There is an equilibrium between the oxidation and reduction reactions. We can write the oxidation-reduction reaction as follows: 
                    Cu2+ (aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu (s)
Even though the Cu2+/Cu redox reaction is at equilibrium, the equilibrium is shifted more to the right when compared to reactive metals. Copper is an unreactive metal at the bottom of the electrochemical series; it easily gains electrons and reduces to copper metal. dard hydrogen electrodeList the various types of half-cellsThe Opposite Happens With Active MetalsWhen a zinc rod is submerged in an aqueous zinc sulfate solution, zinc metal loses electrons and converts to zinc ions; at the same time, zinc ions gain electrons and convert to zinc metal.

A conductive electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution is called a half-cell. For example, a copper electrode immersed in a copper sulfate solution is a half-cell.
We write the half-cell as Cu2+/Cu.
In the half-cell, a difference in potential develops at the interface between the copper ions and copper metal because of the difference in the oxidation states between the electrode and electrolyte; we call it “the electrode potential.”● The voltage measured under standard conditions for a half-cell using a standard hydrogen electrode is called the “standard electrode potential”. It has the symbol EꝊ (spoken of as E standard).
● Standard conditions are
  ▸ The concentration is 1.00 mol dm−3 for an aqueous ionic solution.
  ▸ The temperature is at 25°C (298K).Standard Electrode Potential of Some Half-CellsHere are some examples of standard electrode potentials under standard conditions.
The positive voltage indicates that species are easily reduced, and the negative voltage means that species are easily oxidised. The more negative the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is oxidised (the equilibrium lies further to the left).The more positive the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is reduced (the equilibrium lies further to the right).Notice that we consider the metals at the top of the reactivity series to be good reducing agents. This is because they are easily oxidised, releasing electrons and reducing other metals.Measuring the Electrode Potential of a Half-CellWhy don’t we measure the electrode potential directly without using a reference electrode?
We use a reference electrode (for example, a standard hydrogen electrode with a known potential) to measure the electrode potential of a half-cell. It is not possible to measure the electrode potential directly due to double-layer formation.
The double layer is a layer that forms when a metal electrode is dipped in an electrolyte; for example, a zinc electrode in a zinc sulfate electrolyte. Zinc tends to be oxidised to Zn2+ ions. As a result, the formed zinc ions move into the solution, causing the accumulation of electrons on the surface of the zinc electrode. The accumulated layer of electrons attracts Zn2+ ions in the solution, leaving another layer of positive ions near the surface of the electrode. Electrolysis (Concept Revisited)In the first module, we used electric current to bring about a non-spontaneous redox reaction in an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis uses an electrochemical cell to deposit pure metal or collect non-metal gases under an imposed current.The electrolytic cellElectrolysisConnecting two electrochemical half-cells The electrolytic cell consists of two electrodes immersed in a single electrolyte, where ions move between the two electrodes. Consequently, the positive anode is the electrode at which oxidation occurs, and the negative cathode is the electrode at which ions are reduced.
The electrolysis cell is connected to a power source (battery) to enforce a non-spontaneous redox reaction.
The reaction at the anode:
            X− → X + e−
The reaction at the cathode:
           M+ + e−→ MGalvanic Cells (Voltaic Cells)Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells that use spontaneous redox reactions to produce electricity.The galvanic cell components

The galvanic cell consists of two electrodes immersed in two separate electrolytes. We call the electrode immersed in its electrolyte a half-cell.
The two half-cells must be connected in air and solution for current to flow between them. We use a wire to connect the two electrodes (allowing the flow of electrons) and a tube filled with an electrolyte to bridge the two electrolytes (allowing the flow of ions). Typically, the wire is fitted with a voltmeter to measure the produced electricity (unit volt). Galvanic Cells (Voltaic Cells) cont.When we write electrochemical cell notation, we usually use the following order: the half-cell containing the anode ‖ the half-cell containing the cathode: 
                                                           Cell notation: anode/aq ‖ aq/cathode 
(We separate the two half-cells with a double vertical line ‖, which is the salt bridge symbol).Notice 
- In galvanic cells, ions discharge at the cathode while electrons discharge at the anode (the anode electrode is consumed).
- The electrolyte used in the salt bridge should be inert and not react with any of the two cells' components.
- We write anode/aq ‖ aq/cathode. In half-cells containing only ions, we write: 
reduced anode/ oxidised anode ‖ oxidised cathode/ reduced cathode.

The two half-cells are connected in the air through a wire fitted with a voltmeter and a salt bridge to connect the two electrolytes. Notice that we used a copper electrode in the Cu2+/Cu half-cell and a zinc electrode in the Zn/Zn2+ half-cell.
The voltage produced by the redox reaction is 1.10 volts at standard conditions. he cathode.The Zn/Zn2+ ‖ Ag+/Ag Electrochemical CellWhen connecting the two half cells Zn/Zn2+ and Ag+/Ag, the Ag+/Ag half-cell is the positive electrode, and the Zn/Zn2+ half-cell is the negative electrode (the Eϴ with a positive value is the positive electrode).The reaction of zinc half-cell (Zn/Zn2+):
Zn2+ (aq) + 2e– ⇌ Zn(s) Eϴ = −0.76 V


The reaction of silver half-cell Ag+/Ag:
Ag+(aq) + e– ⇌ Ag(s)       Eϴ = +0.80 V
From Eϴ values, we find that:
   a. Silver ions are easier to reduce.
   b. Zinc is easier to oxidise.
   c. Zinc loses electrons, and silver accepts electrons.
   d. Electrons move in the wire from the Zn2+/Zn half-cell to the Ag+/Ag half-cell. The Zn/Zn²⁺ ‖ Ag⁺/Ag electrochemical cell. The voltage of the cell (standard cell potential) = +0.80 − (−0.76) = +1.56 VThe less positive or negative Eϴ value is always subtracted from the more positive Eϴ value.he Cu/Cu2+ ‖ Fe3+/Fe2+ electrochemical cellWhen the two half-cells are connected, the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell is the positive electrode, and the Cu/Cu2+ half-cell is the negative electrode (less positive).The reaction at the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell:
Fe3+(aq) + e– ⇌ Fe2+(aq)        Eϴ = +0.77 V
The reaction at the Cu/Cu2+ half-cell:Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ⇌ Cu(s)          Eϴ = +0.34 V
Both Eϴ values are positive. The smaller Eϴ value is the negative pole, and the larger Eϴ value is the positive electrode. 
Notice the flow of electrons from the Cu/Cu2+ half-cell (less positive) to the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell (more positive).
Copper loses electrons and is oxidised to copper ions, and Fe3+ ions accept electrons and reduce to Fe2+ ions. On the left, the Cu/Cu2+ half-cell and on the right, the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cellThe voltage of the cell (standard cell potential) = +0.77 − (+0.34) = +0.43VReduction reactions happen at the cathode.Ions discharge Ions discharge at the cathode while the anode is consumed.Ions discharge at both electrodes.ApplicationsBatteries to produce electricity.Purifying metals, electroplating, and manufacturing some non-metal gases.

Mn2+ (aq) + 2e–⇌ Mn(s)    Eϴ = −1.18 V


The reaction at the Pb2+/Pb half-cell:
Pb2+(aq) + 2e– ⇌ Pb (s)    Eϴ = −0.13 V

Since both Eϴ values are negative, we expect electrons to flow from the more negative Mn/Mn2+ half-cell towards the less negative Pb2+/Pb half-cell.

Manganese metal loses electrons and oxidises, whereas Pb2+ ions accept electrons and are reduced. The cell voltage of Mn/Mn²⁺ ‖ Pb²⁺/Pb electrochemical cell at standard conditions is +1.05 V. The the cell voltage (standard cell potential) = −0.13 −(−1.18) = +1.05The Cr/Cr3+ ‖ Cl2/Cl– electrochemical cellThe electrons move from the negative Cr/Cr3+ half-cell towards the Cl2/Cl– half-cell. The Cr3+/Cr half-cell is the negative electrode, and the Cl2/Cl– half-cell is the positive electrode.
The Cr3+/Cr half-cell:
  Cr3+ + 3e–⇌ Cr              Eϴ = -0.74 V

The Cl2/Cl– half-cell:
  Cl2 + 2e– ⇌ 2Cl–           Eϴ = +1.36 V

Chlorine Cl2 is reduced to chloride ions, and chromium metal is oxidised to Cr3+ ions.
The cell voltage (standard cell potential) = +1.36 −(−0.74) = +2.10 V ExerciseExercise: a, bThe following pairs of half-equations represent electrochemical cells. Specify which half-cell is positive, the direction of electron flow in these cells, and which acts as a better oxidising agent.

Exercise: e


Solution: a, b

Solution: c, d, Using Eθ Values to Predict if a Reaction Will OccurPredict if silver ions react with zinc metal.
We can predict if the Ag+ will be reduced when a zinc rod is placed in an aqueous silver solution by looking at their Eϴ values.To compare, we need to look at the two electrode potentials of silver and zinc.
Ag+(aq) + e– ⇌ Ag(s)                Eϴ = +0.80V
Zn2+ (aq) + 2e– ⇌ Zn(s)           Eϴ = −0.76 V
From the Eϴ values, we deduce that zinc is a strong reducing agent (negative Eϴ value) and silver ions are good oxidising agents (positive Eϴ value).Predict if Silver Ions React With Zinc Metal
If we place a zinc rod in an aqueous solution of silver, the following reaction takes place:
Zn(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Ag(s) Zinc is a stronger reducing agent, and silver is a stronger oxidising agent. Notice that for the reaction to happen, we need two arrows, one for oxidation and the other for reduction. The arrows have their heads reversed (form a circle).
No reaction occurs when placing a silver rod in an aqueous zinc solution because silver can’t reduce zinc ions. The Reaction Between Copper Solution and Zinc RodPredict if the reaction between copper solution and zinc rod is feasible
Similarly, we can use the Eϴ value to predict if a zinc rod will react with copper solution.
Zn2+ (aq) + 2e– ⇌ Zn(s)        Eϴ = −0.76 V
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ⇌ Cu(s)         Eϴ = +0.34 V
The Eϴ value of zinc is less than that of copper; therefore, zinc acts as a reducing reagent, reducing copper ions to copper metal. If we place a zinc rod in an aqueous copper solution, a reaction happens between the zinc and copper ions. The direction of the arrows forming a circle in the order of Zn, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cu. The overall reaction is written as:
                                                       Zn (s) + Cu2+ → Zn2+ + Cu (s)
Notice that the direction of the arrows is in the following order: zinc, zinc ions, copper ions, and copper. But if we reversed the arrows by placing a copper rod in an aqueous solution of zinc, no change would be observed.Predict if Iron Oxide Reduces Chlorine GasIf we looked at Eϴ values:
                                               Fe3+ + e– ⇋ Fe2+                Eϴ = + 0.77 V
                                               Cl2 + 2e– ⇌ 2Cl–                 Eϴ = +1.36 VFe2+ ions are more likely to lose electrons and convert to Fe3+ ions (smaller Eϴ value). By that, Fe2+ acts as a strong reducing agent that reduces chlorine gas into chloride ions. Combining the two half-equations:
                                                                       Fe3+ + Cl2 → Fe2+ + 2Cl–Chlorine is a strong oxidising agent; it is more likely to accept electrons. Notice the direction of the arrows: The direction of iron redox reaction is from Fe2+ to Fe3+.Exercise 1Exercise 1Solution aSolution bSolution cSolution dPredict if the following reactions will occur:

I2 + 2e− ⇋ 2I−                   EꝊ= + 0.54 VLesson SummaryThe equilibrium of redox reactions is shifted to the right for unreactive metals compared to reactive metals.A half-cell consists of an electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution.The difference in oxidation state between the electrode and the solution creates a potential difference.The standard electrode potential EꝊ (spoken of as E standard) for a half-cell is at standard conditions (25oC, 1 mol dm−3, and 1 atm for gases).The standard hydrogen electrode is used as a reference when measuring half-cell potential.Standard hydrogen electrode has electrode potential EꝊ equal to zero.The voltage measured under standard conditions using a standard hydrogen electrode serving as the other half-cell is the standard electrode potential for that half-cell (Eϴ) (E standard).The more negative the electrode potential, the easier it is for the element to be oxidised. Moreover, the more positive the electrode potential, the easier it is to be reduced.Due to the formation of double layers at the electrode, we measure the electrode potential using a reference electrode.The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black and immersed in a diluted sulfuric solution (1.00 mol dm−3) while hydrogen gas is bubbled at one atm pressure.Learning OutcomesBy the end of this module, you will be able to:Describe the Nernst equation formulaExplain how to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditionsDefine Cells and batteriesSummarise primary and secondary batteries and their componentsDefine hydrogen-oxygen fuel cellsDiscuss hydrogen cell components and their chemistryList the advantages and limitations of hydrogen fuel cellsNernst equationWe discussed earlier the electrode potential of cells under standard conditions (temperature is 25oC and concentration is 1.00 mol dm−3). The German scientist Walther Nernst developed an equation to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions (at any given temperature or concentration). 
Nernst equation formula: Where
E is the electrode potential under non-standard conditions.
Eꝋ is the electrode potential under standard conditions.
R is the gas constant, 8.314 JK−1mol−1.
T is the temperature in Kelvin.
z is the number of electrons.
F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol−1).
[oxidised form] and [reduced form] are concentrations of oxidised and reduced formNernst formula at 25oCIf we substitute the RT/F with their values at 25oC and convert ln to log10, the formula becomes: The value 0.059 which replaced RT/F is obtained by substituting the values with R = 8.314 J K−1 mol−1, T = 298 Kelvin, F = 96,500 C mol−1, and multiplying by 2.303 to convert ln (x) to log10 (x).Nernst Formula - ExercisesExercise 1SolutionElectrode potential formula at 25oCExercise 1:
Calculate the electrode potential of a Cu(s)/Cu2+(aq) electrode at 298 K that has a concentration of 0.005 mol dm−3 (the standard electrode potential of Cu(s)/Cu2+(aq) electrode is +0.34 V).Exercise 2SolutionElectrode potential formula at 20oC Exercise 2:
Find the electrode potential of an Ag(s)/Ag+(aq) electrode at 20oC that has a concentration of 0.003 mol dm−3 (the standard electrode potential of Ag(s)/Ag+(aq) electrode is +0.80 V).Determining the Feasibility of a ReactionIn the previous module, we studied how to predict the feasibility of a reaction based on the difference between the two half-cells being greater than 0.30 volts. Sometimes, even though the cell voltage is greater than the mentioned value, the reaction is too slow to be considered feasible.Consider the following example of the reaction between the two half cells, 2H+/H2 and Zn2+/Zn.
                                        2H+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ H2(g)                        Eϴ = 0.00 V 
                                        Zn2+ (aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)                      Eϴ = −0.76 V
The voltage of the cell = 0.00 − (−0.76) = 0.76 V.Although theoretically, the cell voltage is greater than 0.30 volts, zinc is considered to lack reactivity when placed in water; the reaction is too slow to be considered.
Another consideration is the difference between industrial and standard conditions. A large deviation from standard conditions can prevent the reaction from occurring. 
In industry, the rate of a reaction is more crucial than Eϴ prediction of the reaction’s feasibility. The rate of a reaction can be increased by raising the temperature, pressure (for gaseous reactants), reactant concentration (for dissolved reactants), surface area (for solid reactants), or by adding a catalyst.Cells and BatteriesBatteries

An electric battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells and is often used to power portable electronic devices. A battery delivers a small direct current derived from redox reactions. Many small appliances, such as mobile phones, cameras, torches, peacemakers, and remote controls, use batteries with a range of voltages. The voltage of the batteries depends on the number of connected cells and the type of electrolytes used. Different types of batteries have different voltages.
Factors to consider when choosing a battery are the battery’s size, voltage, cost, function duration, and rechargeability.Primary batteries (non−chargeable disposable batteries)Solid-state batteries

Solid-state batteries often called “dry cells,” consist of an electrolyte as a paste. They have been improved in recent years to be smaller and to provide more power for a longer lifetime. They can either be disposa
(ln(x)= 2.303 log10 x)Nernst formula for cells containing solids
The concentration of solids doesn’t change; therefore, at 25oC, the Nernst equation can be simplified to: ylindrical Primary BatteriesCylindrical batteriesZinc-carbon batteryZinc-carbon battery components Reaction at the anode & cathode Cylindrical batteries deliver 1.5 V, where the redox reaction proceeds in one direction until all the reactants are depleted. The voltage of these batteries often drops over time.
In the early days, cylindrical batteries were often called “dry batteries” to indicate that they didn't contain a spillable electrolyte. The first cylindrical batteries developed were zinc-carbon batteries.Button Primary Batteries
Button batteries offer an improvement over cylindrical batteries. The most common type has a metal anode, such as lithium or zinc, whereas MnO2, silver oxide, oxygen, carbon monofluoride, mercuric oxide, or copper oxide serve as the cathode. Different electrolytes are used for different loads (appliances). Some button batteries have alkaline or organic-based electrolytes. Others have a layer of solid lithium iodide that allows lithium ions (Li+) to diffuse from the cathode to the anode. Button Primary Batteries - ExampleExample lithium/iodine button cell
Lithium/iodine buttons are often used in electrochemical cells. Their anode is made of very reactive lithium metal with a high Eϴ and easily loses electrons. As a result, the lithium-iodine button cells have a high, constant voltage for a long time, a long shelf-life (some can last for over 15 years, such as those used in pacemakers), and are lightweight.Reaction at the anode:
                                            Li+ + e− ⇋ Li                 Eϴ= −3.04V
Lithium is a very reactive metal; it is easily oxidised, releasing electrons at the anode.
                                        ½ I2 (s) + e− ⇋ I− (aq)         Eϴ= +0.54
The cell voltage = 0.54 − (−3.04) = +3.58 VAlthough we calculated the cell voltage to be 3.58 Volts, the actual cell voltage is about 2.8 volts because the used electrolyte is not at standard (not 1.00 mol dm−3).Secondary Batteries (Rechargeable)Rechargeable batteriesAlthough redox reactions are reversible reactions, in primary batteries, the reaction proceeds in one direction until all reactants are depleted and the voltage declines.
Rechargeable batteries are unlike the primary non-rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries undergo a reversible reaction by connecting the battery to an external electric source. The reaction is reversed when the two poles are connected, and the reactants are restored.
Although, in theory, all reactions in batteries are reversible, in primary batteries, once the discharge has happened some chemicals are no longer available to reverse the reaction.a. Lead batteriesLead batteries used in automobiles 


Lead car battery componentsRechargeable Batteries - Other Developed BatteriesOther Developed Batteriesb. Lithium-ion batteriesNickel-cadmium cells are smaller than lead-acid cells. The issue with this type of battery is its low voltage and proclivity to discharge quickly.
Aluminium-air batteries are lightweight and have a higher voltage, but they are expensive and don’t act as secondary batteries because the aluminium rods must be replaced.ExerciseSolution - The cell voltageSolution - The rechargedHydrogen-Oxygen Fuel CellsHydrogen fuel cells are electrochemical cells that produce energy from the redox reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. They power rockets and space shuttles and are now used in some buses and cars.
Rather than using fossil fuels to power vehicles, hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells produce electricity through chemical reactions.Hydrogen cell components
The hydrogen cell is connected to a compressed hydrogen gas supply that is stored in carbon fibre and fed into the cell. The oxygen fed from the other side is compressed air. Fuel cells are unique in that they produce electricity efficiently (energy per gram is higher than burning fuel) with only water as a by-product. Furthermore, because the energy is used directly, there is no need for moving parts, such as cars that run on fossil fuels. Exercise:
Calculate the cell voltage of the following nickel-cadmium cell.
                Cd(OH)2 + 2e− → Cd + 2OH−                      EꝊ= −0.81V
           NiO2 + 2H2O + 2e− → Ni(OH)2 + 2OH−           EꝊ= +0.49V
If you know that this type of cell is rechargeable, describe the reactions when the cell is charged and recharged.Hydrogen Cell ChemistryEssentially, a hydrogen cell generates energy and water by combining hydrogen and oxygen.
Like any other electrochemical cell, a hydrogen cell consists of two platinum electrodes and an acid electrolyte. Typically, the two electrodes are made of porous platinum supported on carbon and separated with a membrane that allows ions to go through.Reactions at the Negative and Positive ElectrodesReaction at the negative electrode (anode)
Hydrogen gas oxidises by losing two electrons and forming water. 
                                                                 H2(g) → 2H+ (aq) + 2e−
The produced electrons flow through the external circuit used in the electric motor.Reaction at the positive electrode (cathode)
The produced hydrogen ions at the anode diffuse through a membrane to the cathode, where they react with oxygen gas. 
                                                                4H+ (aq) + O2 (g) + 4e− → 2H2O
At the cathode, oxygen gas is reduced, and water is released.The overall reaction
                                                                         2H2 + O2 → 2H2OLesson SummaryThe Nernst equation relates the electrode potential to the temperature and concentration of an electrode.The solid concentration doesn't change and is therefore cancelled when applying the Nernst equation.Some reactions are too slow to consider even with a voltage difference greater than 0.30 volts.An electric battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells and is often used to power portable electronic devices.Different batteries have different voltages and electrolytes.Primary batteries are non-chargeable, and secondary batteries are rechargeable.Solid-state batteries contain pastes moistened with electrolytes.Solid-state cylindrical primary batteries often contain an anode made of zinc and a cathode made of graphite, NH4Cl as an electrolyte in the form of a moist paste, and MnO2 paste, which acts as a polariser to prevent the build-up of hydrogen gas bubbles.A thin paper layer separates the two electrodes in the dry cell to prevent an electrical short circuit.A lead cap on each end of the dry battery connects the battery to the external electrical circuit.Button batteries' anodes are often made of lithium or zinc, and some cathodes are of MnO2, silver oxide, oxygen, carbon monofluoride, mercuric oxide, or copper oxide.Cell electrolytes differ according to different loads (appliances).

Lesson Summary 2 Course assessment Machinery Introduction Machines are an integral part of modern industry, making work easier for human operators. However, these machines also pose a significant risk to workers if not properly safeguarded. The fast-moving parts, sharp edges, and high-powered mechanisms of machines can cause severe injuries like amputations, lacerations, crushing, abrasions, and even fatalities. This is why machine safeguarding is so important - it ensures that workers can do their jobs safely and helps prevent costly accidents and downtime. To understand how to safeguard machines, let's first understand what exactly machines are and the hazards they can present.What is a machine or machinery?
As per ISO 12100, an international standard on machinery safety, a machine is defined as "An assembly fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves and which are joined together for a specific application." 
This highlights the fact that the presence of moving parts is the key characteristic that defines a machine, and it is these moving parts that can create the primary hazards.What is a hazard?Machinery HazardsMachinery hazards can be grouped into two main categories:Mechanical HazardsMechanical hazards can come from the movement of various mechanical parts such as gears, moving belts & pulleys, rotating shafts, reciprocating arms, cutting teeth, or any other parts that are in motion. These different types of hazardous mechanicalMechanical HazardsThere is a risk of injury whenever a machine part moves or has the potential to move. Movements can be reciprocating, sliding/transverse, or rotational. Each form of movement poses a different hazard, including one or more of the following:Abrasion (or Friction) This is the result of friction between a moving part and the skin. The risk increases with the surface's roughness and speed of movement. Even smooth parts can cause abrasion if they are moving at high speeds. The risk may increase if the body part is trapped and unable to escape the hazard.Cutting (or Severing) Crushing (or Pinching) parts are found in various combinations in all machines. Non-mechanical Hazardse additional protection.Mechanical Hazards (Cont.)Drawing in (or Trapping) This is caused when a body part is drawn into a 'nip point' of the moving machine parts. The risk is more significant if the surface is rough or has projections, e.g., screws and bolts. The injury may occur as a direct result of the entanglement or as a result of the body part being dragged into an area where further injuries could occur. Anyone with long hair, loose clothing, gloves, a necktie, jewelry, or any of these things is at considerably higher risk.Impact (or Struck by) Stabbing (or Puncture) Shearing (or Chopping)Risk Control of Machinery HazardsTo ensure the safe operation of machines, it is necessary to control the risks posed by machinery hazards. Controlling the risks involves identifying the hazards, assessing the risk level presented by each hazard, and implementing suitable control measures. This approach can be implemented at any stage of the machinery's lifespan, from construction to disposal, and should be repeated until the risk is deemed acceptable. Hazard IdentificationMachinery hazards that have not been identified can neither be assessed nor managed. The risk control process, therefore, starts with an inspection of the machine operation and its operating parts to identify the hazards present.  This includes checking for all hazardous conditions and predicting any hazardous events associated with the machine. Using a checklist or template can simplify the process, but hazard identification can effectively be accomplished by following these four steps.Analysis of operation
Analysis of machineAnalysis of current controlsMachine intervention analysis This involves observing work activities associated with the machine and recognizing the hazards to which workers may be exposed. In addition to normal operation, these activities may include start-up, shut-down, cleaning, tool changes, common maintenance, etc.When identifying hazards, it is also essential to consider any past accidents, incidents, or malfunctions, as well as relevant regulations, standards, technical specifications, and safety data sheets.Risk AssessmentAfter identifying the machinery hazards, the next step is to assess their risk level and prioritize them accordingly. There are a variety of methods for conducting risk assessments, ranging from technical (quantitative risk assessment) to observational (qualitative risk assessment). A simplified model presented here includes elements of both quantitative and qualitative methods and comprises two steps: Risk Estimation and Risk Evaluation. In risk estimation, the risk level for each hazardous situation is estimated by quantifying the following elements of risk: 
A) Severity of harm, which can be determined based on the extent of injury or health damage, such as minor, major, or fatal, and the number of people affected, such as one or multiple.
B) Probability of occurrence, which is determined by the likelihood of a hazardous event happening and the availability of technical and human measures to prevent or mitigate harmRisk Assessment (Cont.)After assigning the appropriate values for severity and probability, the Overall Risk Score (also referred to as the Risk Index Value) is calculated by multiplying the severity and probability values.
Overall Risk Score = Severity x Probability The overall risk score for each identified hazard is then used to evaluate the level of risk and determine if it is acceptable. If deemed unacceptable, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented.
The scores can also be used to prioritize risks, with higher scores signifying a greater degree of risk requiring more focus and mitigation resources.

You can learn more about the machinery risk assessment procedure by referring to "ISO 12100:2010. standard,  Safety of machinery — General principles for design — Risk assessment and risk reduction".ontrol MeasuresIf the risk assessment process determines that a reduction in risk is necessary, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented. For selecting control measures, the following hierarchy of controls is used to reduce risk levels. Inherently Safe Design MeasuresInherently safe design measures involve eliminating hazards or reducing associated risks through the selection of appropriate design features in the machinery. This is the most effective and ideal solution for reducing risk, as design elements that naturally eliminate or reduce hazards are likely to remain effective, whereas other protective measures can sometimes fail or be ignored. There are two approaches to designing machines with inherent safety.Avoiding or Reducing HazardsExamples of this approach include:
— Reducing the mass, speed, or distances of travel of moving parts.
— Ensuring rotating parts have no projections and smooth polished surfaces.
— Reducing the sharpness and increasing the corner radii of machinery parts.
— Increasing the separation and clearance distances between moving parts.
— Filling or reducing the size of gaps to prevent access to crushing or shearing hazards.
— Reducing operating temperatures and pressures.Machine SafeguardsDue to operational limitations, it may not always be possible to reduce risk to an acceptable level by using inherently safe design measures. In such cases, machine safeguards become the next option.
It's common to use the words "safeguard" and "guard" interchangeably, but they have distinct definitions in the field of machinery safety.What are machine "safeguards"?The word "safeguards" refers to a collection of protective measures used to keep workers from coming into potentially dangerous contact with machinery hazards Those protective measures can be machine guards or safeguarding devices employed separately or in combination.What are machine "guards"?Machine Safeguards (Cont.) What are "safeguarding devices"?For a better understanding, the next page provides the categorization of machine safeguards.
— Reducing voltages.Reducing Access to HazardsAdministrative Controls & PPEPersonal protective equipment (PPE) and administrative controls are viewed as last resort for managing risks associated with machinery hazards. They aim to reduce residual risks after higher-level controls, which address the hazard at its source. Also, these controls require substantial efforts and oversight to be effective and potentially less effective than other risk control methods.Administrative Controls Administrative controls involve implementing procedures and processes to reduce risk by establishing a set of required actions. This can include placing warning signs on machines, having documented safe operating procedures, training workers, lock-out tag-out machines before interventions, etc. Personal Protective EquipmentMachine GuardsA machine guard is a physical barrier or cover that is designed to prevent access to machinery hazards. There are several types of machine guards, each designed for a specific purpose. General categorization is as follows: Fixed GuardsThese guards are fixed permanently (through welding or riveting) or temporarily (by screws, nuts, etc.) and can only be opened or removed with the use of tools or by destroying the attachment mechanism. There are two basic types:Enclosing Guards These guards block access to the danger zone from all sides and cannot be easily removed. However, if frequent access is required, access sections are created along with the use of suitable interlocks. They are typically made from meshed material such as wire mesh, perforated metal, or other similar materials, which allows visibility to the machine. However, if noise, dust, and ejected material protection are also required, solid enclosing guards are used.Distance Guards Note: Enclosing guards provide greater access protection than distance guards.Moveable GuardsThe movable guards remain attached to the machine through hinges or slides and can be opened easily without any special tool. There are three basic types:Adjustable Guards These guards can be adjusted in position or have sections that can be adjusted in position. These are typically secured with tighteners, like wing nuts, that can be tightened or loosened quickly. Adjustable guards are frequently seen on tools like circular saws and pillar drills; however, their effectiveness depends on the user maintaining the correct guard setting. Because of this, adjustable guards should only be used when a fixed or interlocking guard is not feasible.Self-adjusting GuardsInterlocking Guards With Guard LockingFor some machinery, the moving parts may have high momentum and take a significant time to stop, or the machine may be programmed to finish a cycle before stopping. In these situations, a standard interlocking guard may not be enough, and a guard-locking feature may be necessary. The guard-locking feature includes a latching device that prevents the guard from being opened until the latch is opened. There are two types:Interlocking guard with unconditional unlockingIn this case, the operator must unlock the latch before the guard can be opened. This typically requires the operator to activate an “unlocking” control on the machine control panel and provides for a certain time delay between activating the “stop” control and opening the guard.Interlocking guard with conditional unlockingOther TypesInterlocking Guards With Trapped KeyTrapped key interlocking guards ensure that the guard is always closed and locked before the machine can be activated. They work by using a key system to control access to the dangerous parts of the machine and to activate its start function. The key must be inserted into the guard control in order to open the guard and gain access to the dangerous parts. Once the guard is open, the key is trapped in the guard control and cannot be removed until the guard is closed and locked again. Similarly, the same key must be inserted into the start control in order to activate the machine, and it is trapped in the control until the machine is stopped.Interlocking Control GuardsNote: If there is a possibility that someone could become trapped inside the guarded area, then it is necessary to have a presence-sensing device and emergency stop feature available inside the area.Machine Guards Design RequirementsWhen determining the appropriate design and type of machine guards, a comprehensive evaluation of all foreseeable aspects of the machinery's environment and operation during its expected lifespan is crucial. This includes considering the potential dangers posed by the various hazards present and the groups of individuals who may be exposed to these hazards. Inadequate evaluation of these aspects can lead to hazardous situations, such as individuals being able to bypass the guards and exposing themselves to danger.

The aspects to take into account include the following:Machine aspectsHuman aspects
Materials of constructionShape and installation aspectsLet's delve into the elements that should be considered for each aspect.Machine AspectsAccess to dangerous parts of the machineMachine guards should be designed in a way that doesn't require opening or removing them to make adjustments, lubrication, and routine maintenance of the machine. This can be achieved by installing multiple smaller guards that prevent access to dangerous parts while allowing access to safe parts. Also, small access holes can be provided for screwdrivers, test probes, etc. Ejected materials and hazardous substancesNoise LevelRadiationExplosive atmosphereuman AspectsErgonomic aspectsMachine guards may need to be moved or removed at some point; therefore, they should be designed with manual handling in mind, taking into account factors such as size, weight, etc. Sliding guards or doors should be easy to open and not require excessive force. Where guards are too heavy to be moved manually, suitable lifting provisions must be available on the guards.Viewing the processSafety distancesMaterials of ConstructionRigidity and durabilityIt is essential to select and arrange machine guarding components such as support posts, guard frames, mountings, and infill materials in a way that creates a stable, rigid structure able to resist deformation. This is particularly crucial in areas where deformation could compromise the necessary safety distances around the machinery.Impact and ejection resistanceResistance to corrosionNon-toxicityElectrostatic propertiesColor and appearanceShape and Installation AspectsCrushing or trapping pointsIt is important to make sure that the guards do not create any hazardous crushing or trapping points with other parts of the machine or other guards. This means that the guards should be positioned and shaped in a way that prevents workers from getting caught or compressed between them and other parts of the machinery.Hygiene and cleaningSharp edgesIntegrity of jointsRemoval and mounting
Dimensions of Distance GuardsWhen using distance guards instead of enclosing guards to prevent access, it is crucial to ensure that they are of the appropriate size. The recommended approach is summarized below, but for more in-depth guidance, you can consult ISO 13857:2019, which addresses the safety of machinery and the required safety distances to keep hazard zones out of reach of upper and lower limbs.Perimeter Guards Perimeter guards should have a minimum height of 1 meter to prevent individuals from climbing over them. However, the height of the guard (b) may have to be up to 2.5 meters, depending on the height of the danger zone (a) and the horizontal distance to it (c). If portable steps or ladders, or other machines are present in the area, the height of the guard should be increased. If it is challenging to raise the height of the guard, then an enclosing guard may be more ap
Reaching Through OpeningsMachine guards may have holes, slots, and other openings for specific purposes, such as feeding raw material, removing finished products, and viewing the process. These openings must be small enough (and a sufficient distance away from the danger zone) to prevent access to dangerous parts. The closer the opening is to the danger zone, the smaller it will need to be to prevent access. The ISO 13857:2019 standard provides guidance on the safe distances required to prevent access to hazard zones by upper and lower limbs. Here are some examples based on the standard:Finger EntryHand EntryArm Entry If a round-shaped opening (A) has a diameter of 8 - 10 mm, the opening should be located 20 mm or more from the dangerous parts to prevent finger entry access.Interlocking DevicesInterlocking devices aim to stop a machine's hazardous operations under a specific condition, such as by opening a machine guard. These devices monitor the guard's position and send a stop command if it's not closed. They can also control other functions, like applying a brake to stop hazardous machine operations before access is allowed. 
There are various types, but they mainly fall into two categories based on their actuation principle:1.	Mechanically activated devicesThe principle of working for these types of devices is based on physical contact, force, or pressure. They use switching cams, turning levers, or hinges to activate or deactivate the machine. To increase safety, some of these devices may be coded, which means that they can only be operated with a specific actuator, such as a key or a specific shape. 2.	Non-mechanically activated devicesExamples of interlocking devices are shown on the following pageInterlocking Device ExamplesLinear Cam-operated Position Detector This type uses a linear cam to open or close a control circuit by means of an actuator & position detector. It is commonly used on sliding guards to detect when the guard is opened or closed. The linear cam is connected to the sliding guard, and when the guard is opened, it forces the actuator down, which in turn opens the control circuit contacts and deactivates the machinery. Rotary Cam-operated Position Detector Tongue-operated Interlocking DeviceInterlocking Device Examples (Cont.)Lever-operated Interlocking Device In this type, an open guard physically blocks the start/stop lever, preventing it from being lifted to start the machine. The machine may be started once the guard is closed, enabling the lever to be lifted.Captive-key interlocking Device Non-contact interlocking Devices
Mode of ActuationMode of actuation refers to the method or mechanism by which a device is activated or triggered to operate. Selecting the appropriate mode of actuation is crucial for interlocking devices to minimize the risk of manipulation. Mechanically activated interlocks can be triggered in two ways: positive-mode actuation and negative-mode actuation.Positive-mode ActuationNegative-mode Actuation This actuation works by keeping the plunger of the interlocking device pressed down by a cam, resulting in an open circuit as long as the guard stays open. Once the guard is fully closed, a spring moves the plunger back, completing the circuit. In case of a fault, such as the spring failure, the device will fail to a safe condition, and the machine will not operate.Positive-mode actuation is more reliable than negative mode. Therefore, when a guard employs a single mechanical interlock, it should utilize positive-mode actuation. Interlocks with negative-mode actuation should only be used in combination with additional positive-mode actuators on the same guard.Interlocking System FailuresEven though interlocking systems effectively prevent access to dangerous parts, injuries still happen on machines with these types of systems. The reasons for failure can be divided into two categories:Interlock MalfunctionCommonly occurring faults with interlock systems can include misaligned parts, sticking of moving parts, poor electrical connections, short-circuiting, spring fractures, and corrosion. These faults are often caused by vibration, wear, and the accumulation of dust and liquids that have not been adequately addressed in the design or by routine maintenance.Interlock DefeatHow to Avoid Interlock Failures?Ensuring safe operation and preventing interlock failures requires the use of reliable, high-quality, and high safety-rated devices that are difficult to bypass. Additionally, the following suggestions can be implemented to avoid failures:Avoiding Interlock MalfunctionInterlock malfunction can be prevented or reduced by:
— Choosing an interlocking system with high reliability of control system; 
— Installing interlocks securely, so they do not move during use and do not come loose;
— Protecting components and wiring from physical damage;
— If using mechanically activated interlocks, choose those with positive-mode actuation;
— Preventing the use of interlock devices as the standard machine stop;
— Ensuring regular maintenance, testing, and training of personnel.Avoiding Interlock DefeatPresence Sensing DevicesPresence Sensing Devices (also known as Trip Devices) do not restrict access to the danger zone but rather stop the movement of potentially hazardous parts before contact. While these devices offer adequate protection, they are unsuitable in situations where the ejection of machine parts or materials is possible or containment of dangerous emissions (e.g., noise, dust) is necessary. Additionally, if the machine has a slow or inconsistent stop time or is unable to stop mid-cycle during operation, these devices are also inappropriate.
The main types of presence-sensing devices are:Light CurtainsArea Scanning Devices
Pressure Mats
Pressure Sensitive Edges and Bars
Trip SwitchesLight CurtainsLight curtains (also called light guards) are electronic devices that consist of a light emitter and a light receiver. The emitter transmits visible or invisible (such as infrared) light beams, and the receiver detects them. If any of the light beams is blocked, the machine stops. AdvantagesLimitationsInstallation Light curtains minimize the requirement for interlocking guards and give nearly transparent access to machinery. This is especially advantageous for automated machinery moving bulk goods or machinery where regular access for loading or unloading is required.
Area Scanning DevicesArea scanning devices use harmless electromagnetic radiation, usually laser beams, to detect movement or changes within the defined area. When a movement or change is detected, it sends a stop signal to the machine and shuts it down. AdvantagesLimitationsInstallation Laser scanning devices typically have a fast response time and can quickly detect objects and shut down machinery. They can cover a wide area, making them useful for protecting large machines or multiple machines at once. Their applications include detecting personnel in front of unmanned guided vehicles and within perimeter guards, e.g., in robotic machine enclosures.Protective DevicesIn some cases, it may be necessary to perform maintenance or repairs on a machine while the guarding interlocks are disabled. These kinds of interventions are extremely risky and should be avoided if at all possible. Additional control measures, usually involving the use of protective devices, are required if the suspension of interlocks cannot be avoided. Protective devices allow machine parts to move but in a way that reduces the risk to the machine operator. Also, protective devices can offer some degree of protection if a machine is difficult to guard due to its operational requirements. There are two basic approaches:1. Reduce access to the danger zoneThis is achieved using Two-Hand Devices and/or Hold-to-Run Devices. These devices allow machine parts to move but only while control is being operated by someone who is a safe distance away from the danger zone.2. Reduce the hazard in the danger zoneTwo-hand ControlsTwo-hand control devices require an operator to use both hands simultaneously to actuate two separate controls to start a machine. This functionality is typically applied where the operator needs to be very close to the machine and could place his other hand in the danger zone if it was a one-handed control.AdvantagesLimitationsInstallation Two-hand controls are an option for machinery that is otherwise hard to guard (e.g., machines having feed and removal processes). This protective device forces the operator to remain in a designated safe area while operating the machine. The operator must keep both controls engaged to activate the machinery; if one control is released, the machine will stop.-to-run ControlsDevices with hold-to-run operation require an operator to continuously actuate a control to initiate and maintain the operation of the machine. The control can be in the form of a button or lever, which upon release, stops the machine.AdvantagesLimitationsInstallation Hold-to-run controls are typically installed at a safe distance from hazardous areas. These devices require the operator to be positioned away from the danger zone in order to operate the machine by continuously pressing the control. Hold-to-run controls are also used on small power tools such as portable drill machines, where they function as an emergency stop mechanism rather than providing safety by distance.Safe Distance CalculationA protective device's effectiveness depends on its location being far enough from the machine's danger zone. This is because moving parts of the machine do not come to an immediate stop, and if someone can reach the danger zone before the machine stops, it could result in injury.Safe Distance (S)Approach Speed (K)Total Stopping Time (T)Additional Distance (C) The safe distance to install protective devices "S" can be derived using the following formula, as specified by "ISO 13855:2010 Safety of machinery — Positioning of safeguards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body". 
S = (K x T) + CThe same formula can also be applied to other types of safeguards, including interlocked guards, light curtains, pressure-sensitive mats, area scanning devices, etc.Limited Operation DevicesLimited operation devices reduce the inherent hazard in the machine by reducing the speed, or range of movement, of machine parts. While this is beneficial, the risk can rarely be reduced to such a low level that access to the moving parts can be acceptable. Usually, access still needs to be prevented, and because these devices do not prevent access, additional functionality (e.g., hold-to-run or two-hand devices) needs to be provided.Speed Limiting DevicesThese devices provide workers with additional time to avoid an accident by reducing the movement speed of potentially dangerous parts. This feature is useful during machine maintenance or adjustments, promoting a controlled machinery operation. Some machines include a built-in speed limiter that an authorized user with a key or combination can activate.Movement Limiting DevicesEmergency Stop SystemsAn emergency condition in a machine can arise unexpectedly and requires immediate action to prevent injury or damage. Emergency stop systems, also known as E-stops, provide a means for quickly shutting down machinery or equipment in the event of an emergency. AdvantagesLimitationsInstallation When an emergency occurs, it is usually because of something that was not anticipated during the design stage of the machinery. Thus there may not be any built-in features or safeguards to mitigate its effects. In this situation, emergency stop devices provide a means for stopping the machinery in a safe and controlled manner.Types of Emergency Stop ActuatorsWhen used promptly, emergency stop devices can avoid or considerably reduce the severity of injuries. However, using the right type of actuator is essential to ensure prompt activation. The following are the main types of emergency stop actuators.Push buttonsWires and RopesHandlesFoot Pedals These mushroom-head buttons are the most common type of emergency stop actuators and can be found on the control panels of the majority of machines. These actuators are easy to use, activate by pressing, and have a latching mechanism that keeps the switch in the "off" position until reset manually. The resetting process involves twisting the button in the direction indicated by arrows on the button.Span of Control of E-StopsThe span of control refers to the number of machines or machine sections that a single emergency stop device can control. The most common approach is to have a single control that stops the entire machine. However, for larger and more complex equipment, other options are available, but they come with additional risks. These options are:Zone ApproachLarge and complex equipment can be divided into distinct "emergency stop zones" where activating the emergency stop in one zone only affects that specific zone while the others continue to operate normally. If this approach is used, it is crucial to clearly label and educate personnel on the designated zones.Global Approach Cell Approach

The core purposes of NFPA include the eradication of death, economic loss, injuries, and loss of property that happen due to fire and its related hazards (e.g. electrical hazards). In order to introduce and maintain uniformity in the fire protection standards across the world, NFPA publishes various standards. Some of the prominent examples of these standards include: NFPA 1, Fire CodeNFPA 37, Standard for the Installation and Use of Stationary Combustion Engines and Gas TurbinesNFPA 55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code, etc.NFPA 87, Standard for Fluid HeatersNFPA 97, Standard Glossary of Terms Relating to Chimneys, Vents,  and Heat-Producing AppliancesMore than 300 codes and standards have been published by NFPA to date. Among these, probably the most famous is NFPA 70, the National Electrical Code. NFPA 70 also continues a series of standards mentioned on the next page. The NFPA 70 Series As mentioned earlier, the NFPA 70 series comprises a family of standards. There are three standards included in this series.  The NFPA 70E NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, is part of the NFPA 70 family. In this course, you will learn about this standard, especially its 2024 update.The standard covers electrical safety requirements for employees. It primarily focuses on safeguards that ensure workers' productivity and safety from electrical hazards simultaneously. The specific requirements of this standard pertain to the following:Conductors connecting electrical installations with an electrical supply andElectrical equipment and conductors are present on (or within) the buildings or recreational vehicles, mobile homes, and other similar premises, such as industrial substations, carnivals, parking lots, yards, etc.  What is Not Covered by NFPA 70E?NFPA 70E does not cover electrical installations present in communications, auto vehicles, aircraft, marine vehicles, and electrical utilities. Key Principles of NFPA 70EThe key principles of NFPA 70E are related to:Procedures from JSA/JHA/AHA regarding shock protection boundaries.Lockout-TagoutArc flash incident energy expressed in calories/cm2 andPersonal Protective Equipment  In the above list, the abbreviations are:Key Practices in NFPA 70EThe key practices that are the focus of NFPA 70E include: Proper body positioning such that the ergonomic risks get reduced,Written procedures to reduce incidents that might not be obvious enough,Staging a safe work zone with boundaries created from signs, barricades, boundaries, and attendantsUsing rescue hooks in Medium Voltage switching andHuman factor analysis.Now that we have mentioned the major principles and practices mentioned in NFJSA refers to Job Safety AnalysisJHA refers to Job Hazard Analysis, andAHA refers to Activity Hazard AnalysisMoreover, lockout-tagout refers to a procedure that ensures complete and proper shutdown of electrical equipment. It also ensures that the equipment remains deactivated until the maintenance work is completed.hat Importance Does the NFPA 2024 Hold?Not only does the NFPA 2024 hold significant importance for employees, but it is also important for employers. Below, we will address how the updates and changes made in the current standard will be helpful in fulfilling various obligations and objectives:  Safety improvements: Updates made in the standard improve workplace electrical safety by considering new information, best practices, and technological advancements.Legal compliance: Employers can comply with NFPA 70E and prevent any regulatory/legal litigations.Risk reduction: Recent updates in NFPA 70E help reduce electrical injuries and accidents.Continuous improvement: Regular revisions keep the standard relevant and improve protection against various electrical hazards present in the workplace.Industrial best practices: Changes made in the standard reflect advancements in the electrical industry's safety protocol. By complying with the requirements, employers show their commitment to these best practices. Technological advancements: Recent changes made in NFPA consider the technological advancements and allow employers to stay aligned with the safety protocols associated with the new technoNFPA 70E and Its Effects on EmployersSince 2009, updated versions of NFPA 70E have been released every three years. These changes mean employers should be ready to make several changes in their approaches to electrical safety in their workplaces every now and then. That being said, let us first look at areas where the recent upgrades of NFPA 70E impact employers.Risk assessment: Employers must recognize electrical dangers, gauge their likelihood and seriousness, and decide whether further safety precautions, such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), are necessary.Arc flash: In order to establish suitable shock and arc flash boundaries and personal protective equipment, employers must assess shock and arc flash hazards.Training and qualification: Employers are in charge of assigning competent workers and training staff members who may be exposed to electrical hazards.Electrical safety program: Employers are required to create and carry out a program that addresses PPE, staff training, worker duties, electrical dangers, and safety-related work practices.NFPA 70E and its Effects on Employers - (B) This page continues an explanation of the responsibilities of employers after the recent update in NFPA 70E. NFPA 70E and AuditsWith updates every three years, employers implementing NFPA 70E will need to audit their electrical safety practices often. The two major areas requiring these audits will be 1) electrical safety documentation and work practices and 2) electrical-specific fieldwork.Auditing Electrical-Specific FieldworkAuditing electrical-specific fieldwork means conducting an annual (internal or third-party) audit regarding the application of the electrical safety program.Auditing Electrical Safety Documentation and Work-Related PracticesMaking constant updates in the written electrical safety program. One such requirement is specific to NFPA 70E (2024). It mentions completing a gap analysis of the existing documentation and fulfilling any gaps by updating these documents.Performing an internal OR third-party audit of the written electrical safety program. The interval between these audits should not exceed more than three years, as this will prevent getting aligned with the new editions of NFPA 70E.Maintenance of electrical equipment: Employers are legally required to create and execute an electrical maintenance program that adheres to the NFPA 70E standard and guarantees routine electrical equipment maintenance and inspections to avoid mishaps.Compliance with legal and regulatory authorities: Employers are required by OSHA and NFPA 70E to safeguard employees from electrical risks.Investigation of incidents: Employers must look into every electrical incident, even near misses, identify why they happened, and take corrective steps to keep such events from recurring in the future.NFPA 70E and Audits - (B)Auditing Electrical Safety Documentation and Work-Related Practices - ContinuedThese audits will also be performed to ensure that:Electrical safety work practices are regularly updated, andAll arc flash and shock PPE, equipment, and tools have been assessed with their conditions documented. If any of these items require replacement or repair, it should be performed immediately.What is Arc Flash?An arc flash is a phenomenon in which an electric currOSHA and NFPA 70EThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates the implementation of safety-related work practices by employers to reduce workplace fatalities and injuries from arc explosions and flash electrical shock,  electrocution, shock, and other injuries occurring from direct or indirect electrical contact.In this regard, the NFPA 70E standard was developed at OSHA's request. As mentioned earlier, the standard aims to reduce the workplace hazards associated with electrical injuries. It applies to the employees who work on (or near) the exposed circuit parts or energized electrical conductors. These workers can include: ElectriciansLinemenOperatorsElectrical maintenance personnelTroubleshooters, site safety personnel, andAnyone exposed to energized equipment greater than 50 V.Employers should train their qualified and non-qualified personnel, such as janitorial staff and maintenance personnel, to work directly with (or near) the electrical equipment on the NFPA 70E standard. ent flashes over the course and moves through the air between two conductors or toward the ground. The outcomes are frequently severe, and if a person is near an arc flash, they may suffer fatal injuries. Arc flash can happen for multiple reasons, such as condensation, dust in the environment, faulty installation, material failure, accidental touching, etc. The Important NFPA 70E Requirements - BThis page continues explaining some of the most important requirements of  NFPA 70 standard:NFPA 70E 110.2.D.3 requires employees to be retained in safety-related work practices within an interval of three years or less.NFPA 70E 120.2: This article requires employers to identify, document, and implement lockout-tagout procedures used to protect employees from electrical hazards. All procedures must be appropriate according to workplace training and conditions.NFPA 70E 130.5: It requires completing an arc flash assessment to determine the presence of an arc flash hazard. In this regard, the assessment will consider the following:  1. Design of overcurrent protective device.
2. Its opening time, and
3. Its maintenance conditionIf any major modification or renovation has been done, then the arc flash assessment must be updated. Also, the assessment's review intervals should not exceed five years."Shock" and "Electric Shock"In this topic and the one following it, we will look at some of the major changes introduced in the 2024 edition and were not present in its predecessor, the 2021 edition. Please note that these changes are not discussed in great detail. Instead, we will try to understand how these recent changes have removed any previous issues with clarity or how the clauses have been made more specific. By going through these topics, you will understand the specific language used in regulations, especially in NFPA standards. This will provide you with a solid foundation upon which you can build your career further.  First off, the term "shock" has seen an addition as the word "Electric" has been placed before it. So now, shock will be referred to as Electric Shock. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. In discussing Hearing protection boundary, andLung protection boundaryThe term shock refers to shockwave. Examples of the term Electric Shock used in NFPA 70E can be seen in 130.4. In the 2021 standard, requirement 130.4 was called Shock Risk Assessment. However, in the 2024 edition, this has been changed to 130.4 Electric Shock Risk Assessment. The term Electric Shock appears sixty-three times in the whole standard. Introduction of ScopesThe 2024 update in NFPA 70E also made a significant change by introducing scopes to eleven articles. These articles are: 110120130205210215225230240245250Now, the scope of every article is indicated as .1. For example, the scope of Article 110 would be indicatChanges in Article 90This page compares Article 90 from NFPA 2021 and NFPA 2024.  NFPA 2021NFPA 202490.1 - Purpose90.1 - Scope90.2 - Scope90.2 - Purpose90.3 - Standard arrangement 90.3 - Workplaces covered and not covered90.4 - Mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials90.4 - Standard arrangement  Article 90 in NFPA 2024 also contains 90.5, which covers requirements for mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials. Thus, Article 90inNFPA2024 has an extra clause, i.e., 90.3 - Workplaces covered and not90.5 - Explanatory MaterialsAs seen on the previous page, 90.5(c) contains requirements for mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials. Here, we will look at the example of this explanatory material.So, for instance, 90.5(C) of NFPA 70E 2024 says that references made to the standard will be linked with the latest standard unless a date is specified. For example, Information Note No. 2 to table 130.7(c)(15)(a) references Table 1 of IEEE 1584. Now, here, we are not being told about which year's standard we should look into for Table 1 of IEEE 1584. This can lead to confusion, as this table is present in both the 2002 and 2018 versions.  However, according to 90.5(c), we will look for Table 1 in the 2018 NFPA standard since it is the latest one.   Changes in Placement of DefinitionsPreviously, definitions were presented as two articles. For example, definitions related to Artticle 300 were present in 300.2, and definitions of Artticle 360 were present in 360.2. However, all the definitions have been moved to Article 100 altogether.Also, if an article number in parentheses, such as (310), is mentioned after a definition, then this means that the definition is specific to that article only. We will take a deeper look at it on the next page.Changes in Placement of Definitions - continuedConsider the definition of the term "Battery  Effect.' Previously, the term would be defined under the notion of 310.2 as:A voltage exists on the cell line after the power supply is disconnected.  Now, the definition has been moved to Article 100. However, since it is unique to Article 310 only, the definition contains the article number ahead of it in parenthesis. This way, the definition will look as follows:A voltage exists on the electrolytic cell line after the power supply is disconnected. (310)Notice that in the 2024 NFPA 70E edition, the word "electrolytic" has also been included in the definition. We have already mentioned about the structural reorganization of NFPA 2024. The 2018 version of NFPA 70E was expanded in different sections. However, the 2024 version has been consolidated. To understand this better, we will take an example of Article 110.Article 110 and Reorganization The first major change in Article 110 is the addition of scope. As mentioned previously, the scope is indicated by adding .1 ahead of the Article number. So, the scope of Article 110 will be mentioned as follows:110.1: This article covers the general requirements for electrical safety-related workplaces.110.2(A) Policy: According to this article, employers are required to establish, document, and implement an electrically safe work condition policy. This policy should do the following:Make hazard elimination the first priority., andShow compliance with Article 110.2 (B) whenever required. We have talked about consolidation in NFPA 2024  earlier. In this case, the consolidation has been done as follows:From 2021, 110.1 Priority and 110.5(K) Electrically Safe Work Condition Policy have been merged into 110.2 (A) Policy.From 2021, 110.3 Electrically Safe Work Condition and 110.4 (Energized Work) have been merged into 110.2(B) When Required110.2 General has been changed to 110.2(C) Requirements Until Established110.4 Energized Work - Normal Working ConditionsPreviously, Article 110.4 presented requirements regarding Energized Work. The article allowed normal operations of electric equipment in normal operating conditions. However, it presented the following conditions:Proper equipment installation.Proper equipment maintenance.Use of equipment according to the instructions.Ensuring that the equipment doors have been properly closed and secured.Ensuring that equipment covers are securely in their place andThere is no evidence of the imminent failure of the equipment.  However, now, this has been made part of 110.2 Electrically Safe Working Condition (B) When Required - Exception No. 1. Here, another change is seen with the addition of a requirement that says that the equipment must be rated for the fault current. Energized Work - Updated Working Conditions With the addition of one more requirement, conditions for the normal operations of electric equipment in normal operating are now seven. Together, they are listed as: Proper equipment installationProper equipment maintenanceUse of equipment according to the given instructions.Ensuring that the equipment doors have been properly closed and secured.Ensuring that equipment covers are securely in their place andThere is no evidence of the imminent failure of the equipment. The equipment must be rated for the available fault current. 
You may be wondering how someone can detect equipment with the chance of imminent failure. Well, it mostly comes down to experience. Usually, the telltale signs of failing equipment include overheating or abnormal buzzing sounds. However, there are no particular limitations, and abnormality is immediately reported. Changes in 110.4 (A)In 110.4(A)(1) Qualified Person, the word special has been replaced by applicable. This will ensure that the qualified person is only required to be aware of the techniques they will need to use in their work. What we mean by this is that previously, 110.4(A)(1) said:Such persons shall also be familiar with the proper use of special precautionary techniques. Now, here, the word special has been replaced by the word applicable, as mentioned previously. Now, the Article says:Such persons shall also be familiar with the proper use of applicable precautionary techniques.Another change in this article is replacing the word can with shall. Now, the statement a person can be qualified for certain equipment and tasks to be performed would be read as a person shall be qualified for certain equipment and tasks to be performed.30.5 (H) - Equipment Labeling Requirements Article 130.5 (H) contains equipment labeling requirements. Although these requirements have not been changed much in the 2024 edition, they still need to be discussed because of their importance. First, Article 10.5(H) requires labels to show the following information:Nominal system voltage, and Arc flash boundaryApart from these requirements, the label should also contain either.Available incident energy, orArc flash PPE category, as described in Table 130.7(C)(15))(a)/(b) A schematic example of a warning label is given on the next page.Lesson SummaryThe key points covered in the module are: What does NFPA 70 E Cover?Conductors connecting electrical installations with an electrical supply andElectrical equipment and conductors are present on (or within) the buildings or recreational vehicles, mobile homes, and other similar premises, such as industrial substations, carnivals, parking lots, yards, etc. Key Principles of NFPA 70EProcedures from JSA/JHA/AHA regarding shock protection boundaries.Lockout-TagoutArc flash incident energy expressed in calories/cm2 andPersonal Protective Equipment Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:  Identify potential hazards in the work area. Summarise the process of preventing damage to persons or property in the case of an emergency. Explain the protocols that apply to illness or injury at work. Describe the basics of Occupational Health and Safety in the workplace.Plan the design and layout of a safe working space. Define the correct usage of firefighting equipment correctly. Recognise and handle emergencies in the workplace. Definitions
According to the Occupational Health & Safety Act (Act no. 85 of 1993), what is:Definition of "Hazard"Definition of "Hazardous Substance"Definition of "Risk"Definition of "Safe" Hazard means a source of risk or an area where danger may be present.Statutory Requirements of the OHSA
Mandates that the employer provide and maintain a risk-free working environment for the employees' health to the extent that this is practically practicable. Basics of Health and Safety:Create a policy for health and safety.Control hazards and risk evaluation at work.Report illnesses and accidents.Offer instruction and knowledge.Consult with your staff.Basics of Health and SafetyWorkforce Compliance The OHS Act generally places management in charge of health and safety, but the worker is also required to abide by specific legal requirements.
We will focus on the fundamental guidelines that apply to employees throughout the duration of this course.
Every employee has a responsibility to take reasonable precautions for his or her own, as well as others, health and safety at work. In other words, it is up to each employee to look out for their own health and safety.Working ConditionsLegislation Based on Legislation in Section 14 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
Based on Legislation in Section 13 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
 Every employee has the right to be kept informed. 

The employer must ensure that the employee knows the health and safety risks associated with any job being done, anything being produced, processed, utilized, stored, handled, or transported, and any equipment or machinery being used.
Employee InvolvementBased on Legislation in Section 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
Basedon Legislation in Section42 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act An employee who violates a provision of the OHS Act may face legal action. 
They may face a fine, punishment, or even incarceration. (A maximum fine of R 50 000 or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months, or both such fine and imprisonment)
The employer must then offer information on how to take precautions against these threats. 

Unsafe and Unhealthy SituationsPossess the proper workplace amenitiesApply the use of PPE ( Personal Protective Equipment ) correctlWorkman's Compensation ProceduresAfter an injury or accident, the employer must compensate 75% of the worker's salary for up to three months. The employer will receive this money back once the Compensation Fund begins compensating the worker.All businesses are required to pay an annual assessment fee after registering with the Compensation Fund depending on their employees' salaries and the risks connected with the type of job performed. 
Workman's CompensationThe COIDA was amended in 1997, Act No 61 of 1997. Unlike the old Workmen's Compensation Act, COIDA covers most employees, not only those who earn less than a certain amount. 
Workers who are injured on duty or have an occupational disease can claim compensation for permanent or temporary disablement.
All employers, as per the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act No 61 of 1997 (COIDA), must register for worker's compensation. Any employer who fails to do this is guilty of a criminal offence. How Do I Claim Workman’s Compensation in South Africa?

Inform your immediate boss or employer (verbally or in writing). Make a list of everyone who saw the accident. WCL 2: Notice of Accident and Claim for Compensation is the form that must be filled ouObserving Task PerformanceWhen determining if something is a physical hazard, consider whether physical harm to an employee could occur.
Everyday workplace objects, such as flammable items or objects that may violently react to other environmental factors, could be included.Personal Protective EquipmentGloves, safety goggles, safety shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, vests, and full-body suits are examples of personal protection equipment.
Safety gear is crucial in the workplace because it shields wearers from safety hazards and potential health. It is also known as PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), and it guarantees a secure, enjoyable working environment for everyone by reducing the potential of accidents, illnesses, and legal problems. PPE Training Employers are obligated to supply PPE at no cost to employees where it is necessary to safeguard workers.
Employees who must wear PPE must get training to understand the following:When is PPE required?What kind of PPE is required?How to put on, take off, adjust, and wear anything properly.PPE's limitations.Upkeep, usefulness, and proper disposal.Head Protection (Hard Hats ) A strong, protective shell that deflects and resists head trauma.The hat's internal suspension mechanism serves as a shock absorber.Some hats act as electrical shock isolators.Protects from splashes, spills, and drips for your head, face, neck, and shoulders.By altering them, you may add face shields, goggles, hoods, or hearing protection to several hats. Fighting FireFire extinguishers come in a variety of designs to combat various fire classes. The following are the top three categories of fire extinguishers:Water (APW) Fire Extinguishers Large, silver fire extinguishers that are 11 kilograms in weight when full and stand 600 millimeters tall.
APW is an abbreviation for "Air-Pressurized Water."

They are simply big squirt cannons filled with regular tap water and pressured air.Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguishers 

Dry Chemical (ABC) Fire ExtinguishersClass A Fires APWs are designed for Class A fires only: Wood, paper, cloth. APWs will be found in older buildings, particularly in public hallways.
  
They will also be found in computer laboratories. It is important to remember, however, that computer equipment must be disconnected from its electrical source before using a water extinguisher on it.Using water on a flammable liquid fire could cause the fire to spread.
Using water on an electrical fire increases the risk of electrocution. If you have no choice but to use an APW on an electrical fire, make sure the electrical equipment is unplugged or de-energized.Fire Fighting TechniquesFog AttackIndirect AttackDirect AttackCombination AttackThe ‘Two Lines in’ method The hose's fog setting works well to put out flames in tight spaces where there is no breeze.
This is employed by fire departments all around the nation and is praised for its success in putting out fires.

This method, which is most frequently applied to closed-compartment fires, puts out the fire by using the hose's fog nozzle rather than its jet.Safety Measures 
Management to ensure that procedures for the identification of emergencies are known and followed promptly and correctly. 
 
No matter how many safety measures are put in place, emergencies can still happen. Emergency Preparedness does not end with well-maintained fire equipment, First Aid, and clearly labelled emergency exits. 
 
Every employer and employee needs a good understanding of the procedures the company has in place to handle emergencies. 
Everyone should understand their role during an emergency and understand what needs to be done to keep themselves and their fellow employees safe. Accident and Incident Investigations 
The investigation should officially start within seven days and finalize as soon as is reasonably practicable or within the contracted period in the case of contracted workers. 
Accurate records of the investigation must be kept.Accident Book Within your accident book, you should record details like:The name, gender, date of birth, and job title of the injured party.The date the accident happened.The date the accident was reported.The name and job title of the person logging the accident.Whether or not the injured party is an expectant mother. Legislation 
Based on Legislation in Section 24(b) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act

 
According to subsection (c), the following incidents endangering the health and safety of any person must also be reported to an inspector: Where a dangerous substance was spilt. Where the uncontrolled release of any substance under pressure took place. Where machinery or any part thereof is fractured or failed, resulting in flying, falling, or uncontrolled moving objects. Where machinery ran out of control. Details of the Incident Details of the incident include:What happened?Where it happened (place)?When it happened (date and time)?How did it happen?Why did it happen?The names of the witnessesAR 8(3)
Based on Legislation in GAR 8(3) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act

 
We also need to look at the reporting of workplace incidents where machinery is involved.
 
According to Regulation 7 of the General Machinery Regulations, the following incidents involving machinery must be reported to an inspector: Where machinery ran out of control as a result of the failure of a control or safety equipment and could have caused an injury to a person who had been conveyed on or in such machinery or had been in the vicinity thereof
The fracture or failure of any part of machinery in which gas is under pressure results in the sudden release of such ga Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to :Identify the requirements of Safety and Health legislation.Identify roles, duties, and responsibilities for safety in schools and workplaces.Describe a safety statement.Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005
The 2005 Act states that "Every employer shall ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health, and welfare at work of his or her employees." Employer and EmployeesStudents and VisitorsSafety and Health PolicyConsultationIn the case of a school, the "employer" is the Board of Management, or the Vocational Education Committee (VEC).

All teaching and ancillary staff are employees of the school, and so have the responsibilities and rights of employees as dState the main features of a safety statement.Risk Assessment
The control of risks is critical in meeting the requirements of the 2005 Act.

There are three basic stages in making the workplace safe:Identifying the hazardsEvaluating the risks
Implementing risk controlsThese stages are together known as "Risk Assessment" and are covered in this course.Reasonably Practicable: Many of the employer's requirements are to do as much "as is reasonably practicable" to provide a safe place, safe methods, and safe facilities for work. This means that the employer must exercise all due care, having identified the hazards and assessed the risks.Competence: The Act and associated regulations require the employer to appoint a "competent person" to advise on the management of safety and health or complete specific risk assessments in the school. A competent person must be deemed to have sufficient training, experience, and knowledge appropriate to the task. The Principal may consider teachers to be competent to conduct risk assessments in their own classrooms or workrooms.Duties and ResponsibilitiesWhile school management authorities - in most cases, Boards of Management - have the ultimate responsibility for safety and health matters in schools, safety is everybody's responsibility. The 2005 Act applies to all employers, employees in all employments, and to the self-employed. It also has implications for persons who control places of work.
The following are the various safety and health  duties  and responsibilities  of people within the school:Principal
As the person in charge, the Principal oversees safety at the school. The Principal must ensure that the safety statement is applied and should strive to develop a safety culture at the school.Safety Officer Employee DutiesEmployees' duties include complying with safety and health legislation and taking reasonable care to protect their own safety and that of others. They must report hazards or hazardous activity to management and take full account of training and instructions given by the Principal or any person acting on the employer's or Principal's behalf. Competent PersonsThe 2005 Act places a special emphasis on the competence of persons carrying out safety-related tasks. The Act states that a person is competent 'where, having regard to the task he/she is required to perform possesses sufficient training, experience, and knowledge.The Principal may consider a teacher competent to conduct a risk assessment within their own class environment or workroom, as part of managing safety in their school.

Safety Representativeuties and Responsibilities - The Technology Classroom
Before a new technology classroom is used for the first time, the technology teacher typically works with the Principal or safety officer to ensure that the technology classroom conforms to required standards. Equipment, fittings, lighting, ventilation, layout, signage must all be considered, and the school's maintenance staff may be required to assist.Teachers must manage safety and health matters related to their work. Section 15 of the 2005 Act outlines the general duties of persons in control of places of work.

Students have a responsibility to act in a way that does not compromise the safety of anybody in the school. The technology teacher may take care of routine safety matters, like simple maintenance issues. If the matter is more complex, the technology teacher may liaise with the appropriate contacts at the school and relevant maintenance personnel.Responsibilities for Safety: Scenarios
Warehouse worker
Data entry operatorPainter
Warehouse WorkerData Entry OperatorPainter Warehouse worker: Shauna, a warehouse worker, uses an old ladder to get to supplies that are piled high on a shelving unit. She is afraid that the ladder will break each time she uses it, but it is the only ladder there.

Recommendation: Shauna should tell her supervisor about the worn ladder. Her employer must provide a safe means of reaching heights, and the employer can examine ways of changing the system of work.Employer’s Responsibilities
The law requires that every employer ensures the safety, health and welfare of his or her employees while at work.
Employers must:Ensure the place of work is safe, and all plant, machinery, and equipment used for work are safe.Provide and maintain safe working methods.Prevent any conduct likely to put the safety of employees at risk.
Provide information, instruction, training, and supervision necessary to ensure the safety of employees at work.
Ensure risk assessments are carried out and implement measures necessary to ensure safety.
Prepare and revise plans and procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency.
Report accidents and dangerous occurrences as appropriate to the Health and Safety Authority.
If necessary, obtain the service of a person who ¡s competent in safety matters, to ensure that employees’ safety and health is secure at work.
Provide and maintain protective clothing and equipment as necessary.Responsibilities of the Public
While employers and employees have specific duties in maintaining safety and health, everybody else has a duty to support their efforts. This applies to customers, suppliers, and all other visitors to a place of work. The law forbids anybody from interfering with, misusing, or damaging anything provided under safety and health legislation.
Self-Employed People
A self-employed person has the same responsibilities as any employer, and must ensure that people are safe where they work.Responsibilities in Schools
In school, everybody present has a responsibility to ensure that the classrooms and common areas are safe.

For example, if you come across a coat lying across a walkway in the classroom, you should hang it up out of harm’s way.

If you see a trailing cable in the classroom, report it to the teacher who can take action.

If a window is broken, the broken glass is a serious hazard, you should tell your teacher or the caretaker as soon as possible.Safety Statement Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the employer and persons in control of places of work must prepare a safety statement.  A safety statement specifies how the safety of everybody at the school is secured and managed. It documents work done as well as plans for maintaining and improving safety in schools. It also clarifies roles and responsibilities for safety in specific contexts - laboratories, workshops, classrooms, sports halls, and so on.For workplaces, a safety statement carries the same meaning. It is a report of all the hazards and risks found in a workplace, and an account of controls put in place to manage them. It explains in detail how the employer plans to ensure a safe and healthy work environment for both workers and visitors.Benefits of a Safety StatementUsing a safety statement, an employer can make safety issues clear to workers.It also helps to make everybody aware of the importance of safety at work, and provides a safe approach for each task in the workplace.ontributors to the Safety StatementWhere a safety officer is appointed, he or she works with the Principal to create the safety statement. If a safety representative is nominated by employees, that person may also contribute to the safety statement. Each school may set up a safety committee to regularly review safety issues.Emergency

The safety statement needs to include procedures to be followed when an accident occurs and in the event of an emergency or serious danger.Safety Statement PreparationYou must document full details of all hazards Identified in and on the school and workplaces, and the risk assessment of each in the safety statement. You must also describe the control measures put in place to minimise or eliminate each hazard.Roles and ResponsibilitiesIndividual responsibilities should be stated in the school's safety statement and should refer to specific job titles. The safety officer and safety representative should be named where they are appointed, and the safety duties of the caretaker, teachers, and any other staff should be set out.All staff should be able to learn their safety roles from the safety statement. The Principal must bring the safety statement to the attention of all staff and the relevant section to all others who may be exposed to risks so that they are aware of the risks and any controls in place.For workplaces, a Safety Representative may be selected by employees to represent them on matters of safety, health, and welfare in the workplace.  A safety committee will be appointed for a large workplaceLesson SummarySection 25 of the 2005 Act sets out the functions of safety representatives that allow them to act on behalf of employees to help ensure a safe and healthy workplace.In schools,  teachers must manage safety and health matters related to their work as outlined by Section 15 of the 2005 Act.A safety statement specifies how the safety of everybody at the school is secured and managed.Some of the main features of a safety statement are:Accident procedures.Controls to reduce risk.The selection and function of a safety representative.The safety representative can be selected by the employees, including non-teaching staffLearning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Define a hazard.Recognise hazards.Identify hazard types.
Define risk.

Describe risk measurement.
Define risk assessment.
Define risk control measures.
Explain the safe system of work.
Identify key control measures. (in the case of schools), to represent them on matters of safety, health, and welfare.Hazards A hazard is anything that could cause harm. Hazards take many different shapes, and may even be Invisible. While some hazards are fairly easy to spot, others are not. For example, stress, exposure to noise, or radiation are less obvious than, say, a trailing cable.Hazards at SchoolSome situations that may seem safe upon inspection may be hazards if viewed at a different time. For example, an obstacle In a corridor poses little threat during class times, but at lunch break or between Basses, It could be a serious trip hazard.Workplace HazardsThe school is obliged by law to do all it can to ensure the safety of all who work and study there. You must identify the hazards and do what you can to eliminate or reduce the risk to a minimum.Types of HazardsHigh-stress levels, machinery, a poorly designed workstation can all be hazardous. It is important to be aware of all Types of Hazards.
Hazards In the workplace may change with circumstances. A schoolbag is not hazardous in itself. However, left in a classroom aisle, it presents a trip hazard.Potential Hazards Found in SchoolsHazards vary around the school. Consider the potential hazards of the kitchen, technology classroom, laboratory, sports hall and stores, and the general classroom. Kitchen: Slippery floors, Hot surfaces, Sharp objects, Chemical cleaners, Stress.Technology Classroom: Sharp tools, Machinery, Manual handling, Trailing cables, Large pieces of materials, Dust, Manual handling.Laboratory: Chemicals, Dissecting kit, Burners.General Classroom: Damaged seats, Protruding nails or screws, Trailing cables, Broken sockets, Broken light fittings, Windows on the first floor and higher, Bullying.Spots Hall and Store Room: Manual Handling, High shelving, Gym equipment, Bullying.Types of Hazards


There are six basic hazard types. Knowing these will make it easier to spot hazards in many different contexts.Biological AgentBacteria, Viruses, Substances from plants or animals causing infection and other health problems.HealthChemical PhysicalWhat is Risk Risk is the likelihood that a hazard will actually cause harm. For example, working at a height is a hazard. There is a risk of falling.Working with cutting machines is a hazard. There may a risk from flying debris, or from becoming entangled.Hazard and Risk
Chemicals held in containers are hazardous but there is very little risk while they are stored safely.Serious risk can arise when chemicals are in use, whether in the laboratory or around the school. Be mindful that many cleaning agents can be hazardous.Hazard versus Risk
Levels of risk vary with conditions. For example, most areas of the school are low risk at quiet times, but at lunchtime, when many students are moving about, risk levels rise noticeably.For example, the likelihood of an accident through student horseplay or somebody tripping over a schoolbag is much greater during lunchtime or between classes.Measuring RiskRisk Levels
A grass maintenance programme in a small school with a small lawn and no playing field presents a far lower level of risk than that of a large school with multiple areas and extensive grounds.Risk Measurement Factors: The level of risk depends on how likely it is that a user will be injured under normal conditions and usage, how serious any injuries that result could be, and how many people are involved.Calculating Risk - 1: Likelihood x Severity of the potential injury x Number of people who may be exposed to the hazard.
Consider a certain hazard, and rate that from 1, meaning not very likely, to 3 meaning quite likely. Then rate the possible Injury that might be caused by the hazard and rate 1 for not severe to 3, very severe. Finally, rate the number of people in contact with the hazard or the area around it, 1 for very few, to 3 for quite a lot.Levels of RiskHigh: A strong chance of injury occurring, and the injury could be serious or very serious.
Medium: Some chance of injury and severity. For example, an injury to a limb.Low: Very little chance of injury and, if an injury were to happen, it would be very minor.Risk AssessmentRisk assessment is the consideration of any risk that may arise from identified hazards. It involves collecting information and making decisions.
If your assessment is that a risk exists, you must take action to eliminate or minimise that risk.Risk Assessment Steps Identify the hazards.Estimate the risk from each hazard.Consider how to eliminate or reduce that risk.Document a plan to eliminate or minimise the hazard.All employers must carry out risk assessments for every activity that occurs on their premises, Identify hazards, and assess the risks arising. Human-Factor:
ErgonomicSimple Risk Assessment - Manual HandlingConsider a load of heavy boxes delivered to the school. Heavy loads can cause a serious back injury to somebody who does not lift them properly, or for whom they are too heavy. The hazard is the heavy load; the risk is the chance of a back injury.To lift safely you should:Clear the area of all obstacles.Give yourself plenty of room.Consider the weight and shape of the load.
Keep feet hip-distance apart.
Stand with feet in the direction you are going.Place feet firmly on the ground.

Bend your knees, not your back.Grip firmly using the palm of your hand.Keep close to the load.
Keep the load close to your centre of gravity.Control MeasuresTo eliminate or reduce risk, you put control measures in place.  When deciding how to control risk, you should follow the General Principles of Prevention, set out in the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005. 

Nine Principles of Prevention: Avoidance: The avoidance of risks or removing the risk altogether. Evaluation:  The evaluation of unavoidable risks. Calculate the level of those risks that cannot be avoided.Combating: The combating of risks at source, taking immediate action where possible.Adaptation of work: The adaptation of work to the individual, especially with regard to the design of places of work, and the choice of work equipment.Adaptation of place: The adaptation of the place of work to technical progress.Replacement:  The replacement of dangerous articles, substances, systems of work by safe or less dangerous alternatives.Giving of priority: The giving of priority to collective protective measures over individual protective measures - look after everyone and not just the individual.Development of policy: The development of an adequate prevention policy in relation to this type of risk.Training: The provision of appropriate training, instruction, and protective equipment to employees.Employers must apply the principles of prevention to avoid hazards. Where hazards cannot be avoided, employers must assess the risk and reduce it by using measures that protect all workers or by using safer work procedures.
Where hazards cannot be avoided or reduced, employers have a duty to put in place appropriate measures for the protection of workers such as training and signage.
Avoidance
The first option you must consider when dealing with risk is to avoid the hazard completely, and so eliminate the risk altogether. If you can, you remove the dangerous item, or rearrange things so that the hazard no longer exists.
Evaluation
When you cannot remove risk, you must evaluate the risk that you can't avoid. This allows you to analyse the situation and helps you to come up with solutions.
Risk Reduction
After evaluation, you act to reduce the level of risk. This might mean, for example, making sure that there is somebody holding the bottom of a ladder, when in use.Working SafelySafe System of Work
Every employer must implement a safe system of work. This means that employers must provide systems of work that are planned, organised, performed, maintained, and revised as appropriate. Hazards associated with work activities must be identified and appropriate control measures put in place before work commences. All workers must be made aware of their responsibilities regarding safety. Safety Duties
As an employer, or, as in the case of a School Principal, the representative of the employer, you are obliged to inform all staff of their safety duties. Students also need to know that they have a responsibility not to behave in a way that might add or create risk.Safety Culture
You also need to develop a safety culture in the school, so that safety becomes natural and is not regarded as a chore. Relevant safety signage, training, and discussions of safety issues can serve well in this regard. Attitudes are also a key element of a safety culture.Use of Chemicals in Schools
Policies With regard to handling, use, and storage of chemicals, whether in the laboratory or stored for cleaning or maintenance, must be clear and comprehensive. Clear labeling of containers and secure well-managed storage.  
Suitable protective clothing must be worn when handling dangerous substances.
Disposal of waste materials must be controlled and safe for staff, students, and the environmen
You can:Avoid accidental ingestion by maintaining good practices like washing hands after using chemicals or dangerous materials.Avoid or reduce inhalation by using filter masks and other protective equipment and fume extractors.Avoid accidental absorption by wearing suitable protective clothing.
Accidental injection can be avoided by good safety practices.Using Chemicals: What to DoUsing Chemicals What NOT to Do - Read and understand the label and the process for which you want to use the chemical.
- Follow any available instructions.
- Wear protective clothing and use protective equipment.
- Know and follow safe procedures.
- Wash your hands before and after use.
- Store the container properly after use.
- Ask for advice if you have any doubts.Lesson SummaryA hazard is anything that could cause harm. While some hazards are fairly easy to spot, others are not.

Interim Assessment Course assessment Overview of OHSE Principles Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment (OHSE) is a comprehensive framework aimed at preventing workplace hazards, safeguarding worker health, and reducing environmental impact. Through structured management systems, OHSE promotes a safe and legally compliant work environment. These practices are a valuable organisational investment, proven to decrease accident rates, increase productivity, and enhance reputation.Key OHSE Concepts OHSE covers three primary areas:
 Occupational Health focuses on preventative health measures that ensure worker well-being, addressing both physical and mental health needs. Safety refers to the procedures and protocols designed to prevent accidents and injuries in the workplace, from hazard identification to risk mitigation. Environmental Management minimises negative environmental impacts by promoting sustainable practices in resource use, waste management, and pollution reduction.The Multidisciplinary Nature of OHSE is integral to its effectiveness. This approach draws on health sciences, engineering, psychology, and environmental studies, offering a holistic view of workplace safety that combines ethical practices, human behaviour insights, and scientific advancements. By integrating these fields, organisations create a comprehensive system that prioritises both human and environmental healHuman Factors in OHSE Human factors play a crucial role in understanding how various psychological, physiological, and ergonomic elements influence worker safety and productivity. By addressing these aspects, organisations can effectively reduce risks, enhance job satisfaction, and improve overall safety.Psychological factors such as high-stress environments, repetitive tasks, and mental fatigue are particularly relevant in high-risk sectors. For instance, stress management resources, coupled with ergonomic practices, help to reduce fatigue and prevent accidents. Ergonomic considerations are also essential, as poorly designed workstations or tools can lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and repetitive strain injuries. Conducting ergonomic assessments and providing customised workstations help maintain worker comfort and minimise strainIntroduction to ISO 45001 ISO 45001 is the international benchmark for occupational health and safety (OH&S) management systems. It sets the standard for organisations looking to proactively improve safety and reduce health and environmental risks. This globally recognised framework supports organisations in creating structured safety protocols that integrate seamlessly with business practices. Unlike previous standards, such as OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001 places a strong emphasis on embedding safety into all organisational activities, from top management decision-making to daily operations, creating a safer and more cohesive workplace environment.Introduction to Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) ISO 14001 is a globally recognised standard that assists organisations in developing effective environmental management systems (EMS) to control and mitigate environmental impacts, conserve resources, and comply with regulations.Purpose and Overview of ISO 14001An EMS under ISO 14001 provides a structured approach for organisations to achieve environmental sustainability while enhancing their public image and meeting legal obligations. This standard enables organisations to integrate sustainability into their daily operations, supporting the global goal of environmental protection while improving operational efficiency. ISO 14001 incorporates several core elements designed to manage environmental impact systematically. These include setting an environmental policy, establishing measurable objectives, identifying potential environmental risks, and regularly monitoring and improving environmental performance. Adhering to ISO 14001’s guidelines helps organisations meet regulatory standards, avoid potential penalties, and foster a commitment to long-term environmental sustainability.Core Elements of ISO 14001 ISO 14001 is built around several essential components that guide organisations in creating and sustaining an effective EMS. The development of an environmental policy is the foundation, where organisations outline their environmental goals, responsibilities, and strategies for achieving sustainability.Environmental planning follows, identifying key environmental risks and setting measurable objectives to mitigate these impacts. This phase includes evaluating compliance requirements, which align organisational practices with local and international regulations, ensuring that operational activities meet or exceed environmental standards.Monitoring and Evaluation are critical for assessing environmental performance. Organisations use these tools to track progress toward objectives, address areas needing improvement, and ensure compliance with ISO 14001 standards. Continuous improvement is embedded in ISO 14001, requiring organisations to regularly review and update their EMS to address new environmental challenges, regulatory changes, or organisational shifts. Through this iterative process, organisations strengthen their commitment to sustainability, promoting responsible resource usage and waste reduction over time.International Standards for OHSEInternational standards from bodies like OSHA, ILO, and the EU form a global framework for OHSE. These guidelines set minimum safety expectations, helping organisations align with best practices, regardless of their location or industry. International OHSE standards not only ensure compliance but also demonstrate an organisation’s commitment to globally accepted workplace safety and environmental principles. The Broader Scope of OHSE Management OHSE management encompasses a wide range of areas, including accident prevention, environmental sustainability, health promotion, and emergency preparedness. By covering these diverse areas, OHSE provides a framework to manage all organisational risks effectively.Inclusion of Environmental and Health Elements: OHSE considers not only the physical safety of workers but also the organisation’s environmental impact and the health of its employees. For instance, measures to reduce pollution or improve ergonomics support long-term sustainability and well-being. Comprehensive Risk Management: The comprehensive nature of OHSE enables organisations to anticipate risks and take preventive actions, reducing both immediate and long-term hazards that can impact productivity and safety.Core Principles of OHSE Management Continued Continuous improvement is integral to OHSE, requiring organisations to regularly review and enhance safety measures. This principle encourages ongoing audits, feedback loops, and updates to policies to address new risks and adapt to organisational changes.OHSE encourages the involvement of all stakeholders, including employees, managers, and safety committees. By engaging everyone in the safety process, organisations foster a shared responsibility and create a proactive safety cLesson SummaryThe main points covered in the module are:
Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment (OHSE) aims to create safer, healthier workplaces by focusing on structured management systems that prevent hazards and protect workers and the environment.OHSE Principles integrate occupational health, safety protocols, and environmental management to promote organisational responsibility and productivity.Human Factors such as ergonomic design, psychological stress, and risk perception are essential in reducing workplace incidents and improving safety.ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 Standards provide globally recognised frameworks that help organisations implement structured OHSE management systems and sustainable practices.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) within OHSE highlights the ethical responsibility of organisations to go beyond compliance, fostering worker protection and environmental care.Hierarchy of Controls guides organisations in implementing effective hazard controls, prioritising elimination and substitution of hazards over PPE and administrative controls.Continuous Improvement through the PDCA cycle ensures that OHSE systems are adaptive, addressing new risks and reinforcing safe practices across operations.Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Assess hazard identification techniques for physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic risks in occupational settings.Describe the role of Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in identifying and managing workplace hazards.Explain qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods and their applications in OHSE.Outline the hierarchy of controls, highlighting effective hazard control methods from elimination to PPE.Identify best practices for hazard communication, including the use of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).Evaluate the effectiveness of combining qualitative and quantitative risk assessment approaches in complex work environments.Summarise the imporHazard Identification TechniquesIdentifying hazards is a proactive approach in OHSE that enables organisations to detect and address potential risks before they result in accidents, injuries, or health issues. Hazards are broadly classified into four main categories: physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic, each requiring specific techniques for identification and management to ensure a safe workplace.tance of continuous monitoring and updating hazard identification processes to adapt to changing workplace conditions.Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Assessment Methods In OHSE, risk assessment is crucial for evaluating the likelihood of hazards and their potential impact on health, safety, and operations. By systematically assessing risks, organisations can prioritise hazard control efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted mitigation measures. Risk assessment is broadly categorised into two main approaches: qualitative and quantitative, each with unique methodologies and applications.Control Measures and the Hierarchy of ControlsThe hierarchy of controls provides a structured framework for managing workplace hazards by prioritising control measures according to their effectiveness. This model allows organisations to address hazards at their source, aiming to eliminate or reduce risks before they reach employees. The hierarchy of controls is widely used in OHSE as it offers a systematic approach to risk reduction, moving from the most effective controls to the least effective. By following this structure, organisations can establish multiple layers of protection, significantly enhancing workplace safety.Hazard Communication and LabellingEffective hazard communication is essential in OHSE as it ensures that all employees are aware of potential risks in their workplace, which is a fundamental component of a safe working environment. By clearly communicating hazards through labelling, signage, and information sheets, organisations provide employees with the knowledge needed to handle materials safely and respond appropriately to potential hazards. This topic covers the importance of communication, the role of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), and practical applications in creating a transparent and safety-focused workplacInternational OHSE Regulations and Standards International OHSE standards and regulations form the foundation of workplace safety practices, providing universally recognised guidelines that organisations can implement to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of employees. Key regulatory bodies like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the European Union (EU), and the International Labour Organization (ILO) enforce compliance and promote best practices across various industries. These standards, such as ISO 45001 for safety and ISO 14001 for environmental management, help companies meet both legal requirements and ethical obligations.Overview of Key Regulatory BodiesOSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)Scope and Impact: OSHA is a US-based agency that sets and enforces safety regulations across industries, including construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. OSHA standards, outlined in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, cover areas such as machine safety, hazardous materials, and personal protective equipment (PPE). OSHA’s General Duty Clause also mandates that employers provide a workplace free of recognised hazards. Requirements: OSHA mandates regular inspections, employee training, hazard communication, and incident reporting to ensure compliance. Failure to adhere can result in substantial fines and legal action. For example, OSHA enforces stringent fall protection measures in construction, requiring the use of guardrails and fall arrest systems to prevent injuries.Overview of Key Regulatory Bodies Continued European Union (EU) OHSE DirectivesHarmonised Standards and New Approach: The EU’s approach involves directives that set minimum OHSE requirements, such as the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC. This directive mandates that employers assess and mitigate workplace risks, apply safety measures, and provide safety training. Member countries transpose these directives into national legislation, allowing for regionally adapted implementation.Key Standards and Compliance: European standards, such as those created by CEN and CENELEC, enable organisations to meet “essential safety requirements.” Complying with these standards allows companies to apply CE marking on products, indicating conformity to EU safety standards.Specific Examples: EU regulations address high-risk areas like machinery operation, chemical handling (Chemical Agents Directive), and noise exposure (Physical Agents Directive). Industries in Europe also follow the REACH regulation, which governs the safe use and handling of chemiLegal Responsibilities of Employers and EmployeesEmployers have an essential, legally mandated role in ensuring a safe work environment by adhering to established OHSE standards, conducting risk assessments, and enforcing proper safety protocols.cals to protect human health and the environmentEmployer Obligations Under OHSE LawProviding a Safe Workplace: Employers are legally required to identify and mitigate workplace hazards by conducting regular risk assessments. This includes analysing potential risks, such as mechanical equipment, hazardous chemicals, or physical layouts, to ensure that all potential dangers are accounted for and managed effectively.Supply and Maintenance of PPE: Employers must supply appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to workers at no cost. Examples include gloves, helmets, eye protection, and respiratory equipment, depending on the workplace risks. Additionally, employers are responsible for maintaining PPE and ensuring its availability at all times.Information and Training: Employers must provide training and education on safe practices, including how to use machinery, handle hazardous materials, and follow emergency procedures. OSHA, for instance, requires that all safety training be conducted in a language and vocabulary that workers understand, ensuring clear comprehension and compliance.Safety Protocols and Emergency Preparedness: Employers are required to establish clear safety procedures and emergency response plans, including evacuations and first-aid protocols. This is reinforced by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, which mandate that employers have structured plans for emergencies and effective communication in case of incidents.Monitoring and Recordkeeping: Employers must document all incidents, injuries, safety inspections, and employee training records. This documentation helps demonstrate compliance during audits and provides data for improving safety protocols. OSHA also requires that companies report certain severe incidents within a specific timeframe, helping to maintain transparency and accountability.Employer Obligations Under OHSE Law ContinuedEnforcing accountability among employers is essential for maintaining a safe work environment. Regular safety audits and accurate documentation help ensure adherence to safety standards, promoting ongoing compliance and accountability in protecting workers.Regular Safety Audits: Conducting periodic safety audits, either internally or with external inspectors, reinforces the commitment to safety standards. For instance, documented inspections ensure that equipment is functioning correctly and that employees are following safety protocols.Documentation and Reporting: Accurate recordkeeping is crucial for accountability. For example, maintaining records of safety training and PPE usage shows a company’s proactive efforts to keep workers informed and protected.Audits and Inspections: Tools for OHSE Compliance Audits and inspections are crucial for maintaining safety in workplaces by identifying hazards, ensuring adherence to OHSE regulations, and evaluating the effectiveness of safety procedures. They help organisations proactively address potential risks before incidents occur, fostering a culture of safety and regulatory compliance.Compliance Documentation and Reporting in OHSE Maintaining accurate and thorough documentation is essential in Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment (OHSE) management. Proper record-keeping ensures that organisations can verify their compliance with safety standards, demonstrate their commitment to employee well-being, and provide a clear record for auditing and inspection purposes Module 1 Fundamentals of Occupational Health, Safety, and Environmental Management 1.

Scan now Importance of Accurate DocumentationAccurate documentation in OHSE is essential for legal compliance, risk management, and accountability. It provides the evidence needed to meet regulatory standards, manage safety risks, and ensure transparency, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement in workplace safety.Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Compliance documentation, including incident reports, inspection logs, and training records, is vital for demonstrating adherence to OHSE laws. Regulatory bodies require organisations to maintain these records for a certain period, as they provide evidence of compliance and the effectiveness of safety measures. Proper documentation helps organisations avoid penalties, fines, and liability issues by proving they follow legal safety requirements.Risk Management and Safety Improvement: By keeping detailed records of incidents, near misses, and hazards, organisations can monitor trends, identify recurring risks, and implement preventive measures. For instance, analysing incident reports over time may reveal that certain areas of the workplace are more prone to accidents, prompting a need for increased safety measures in those areas.Accountability and Transparency: Well-organised documentation enables both internal and external stakeholders to verify that safety procedures are followed. In the case of an incident, records such as safety checklists and training attendance provide an accountable record of stepsEssential Compliance Documents in OHSEEssential compliance documents, such as incident reports, training records, and safety data sheets, are critical for maintaining workplace safety. These documents ensure that hazards are identified, risks are managed, and employees are well-informed, supporting both compliance and safety.Incident Reports and Hazard Logs: Incident reports detail accidents and near misses, helping organisations analyse causes and implement corrective actions. A comprehensive hazard log, recording all identified risks, supports a proactive approach to risk management by enabling continuous monitoring of safety hazards.Training Records: Documenting safety training sessions, including the topics covered and attendees, is critical for compliance. Training records confirm that employees have been educated on necessary safety procedures, reducing liability and reinforcing employee awareness.Safety Data Sheets (SDS): For organisations that handle hazardous materials, SDS are required to inform employees about chemical properties, handling guidelines, and emergency response procedures. SDS help standardise information about hazards, which is essential for both compliance and the safe handling of dangerous substancBest Practices in Record-Keeping and Reporting Best practices in record-keeping and reporting ensure that OHSE documentation is accurate, accessible, and secure. By using digital systems, standardising templates, automating reminders, and ensuring data security, organisations can improve efficiency, maintain compliance, and support continuous safety improvements.Adopting digital reporting solutions can streamline record-keeping, providing a centralised database for easy access, storage, and retrieval of compliance documents. Digital systems also support real-time data entry and immediate accessibility, reducing delays and ensuring accurate record-keeping.Implementing standardised templates for incident reports, safety inspections, and training logs promotes consistency and completeness. Templates ensure that all necessary information is captured, making records easier to review and compare during audits or inspections.Automated systems can help manage compliance deadlines, sending reminders for upcoming audits, equipment maintenance, or required training sessions. Automation reduces the risk of overlooked tasks, keeping compliance activities on schedule.Consequences of Non-Compliance in OHSENon-compliance with OHSE standards exposes organisations to significant legal, financial, operational, and reputational risks. These consequences impact not only organisational stability but also the safety and well-being of employees. Consequences of Non-Compliance in OHSE ContinuedLegal and Financial PenaltiesRegulatory bodies, such as OSHA and the EU’s health and safety agencies, enforce strict penalties for non-compliance. These can include hefty fines, operational shutdowns, and, in extreme cases, criminal charges for severe violations. For example, OSHA categorises violations by severity, with more severe or wilful violations resulting in higher fines and, potentially, imprisonment of responsible parties. Additionally, legal battles and settlements can lead to escalating costs, affecting cash flow and profitability, as seen in cases involving companies like Volkswagen and Enron, where non-compliance resulted in billion-dollar penalties and long-term financial instability.Corrective and Preventive ActionsAddressing non-compliance requires a structured approach, combining immediate corrective actions with long-term preventive measures to ensure continuous improvement in safety practices.
Corrective Actions: Immediate corrective measures are essential to resolve existing safety violations. These actions may include updating outdated safety equipment, improving PPE accessibility, or conducting refresher safety training sessions. For instance, a manufacturing company found to have unsafe chemical storage practices might conduct an emergency review of storage protocols and replace old containers to prevent further incidents.Preventive Actions: To prevent recurrence, organisations implement systematic preventive measures. These include establishing robust compliance programs, conducting regular risk assessments, and offering continuous training to employees. For example, companies might adopt compliance software to monitor safety standards in real time and address any detected deviations swiftly. Preventive actions ensure that compliance is embedded into daily operations, reducing the likelihood of future violations and fostering a proactive safety culture.Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Explain the purpose and importance of environmental management systems like ISO 14001.Describe the key components and clauses of ISO 14001 for effective EMS implementation.Identify the benefits of ISO 14001 certification and its impact on compliance and sustainability.Outline the development and essential elements of an effective environmental policy.Discuss the role of management in EMS implementation and continuous improvement.Evaluate various strategies for reducing environmental impact, including waste management and energy efficiency.Summarise the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and its significIntroduction to ISO 14001 ISO 14001 aims to help organisations proactively minimise their environmental footprint while complying with applicable regulations.

This fosters resilience and operational flexibility, especially valuable in industries facing stringent environmental regulations.Alignment with Broader Sustainability Goals: ISO 14001 aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), helping organisations contribute tDeveloping an Environmental PolicyAn effective environmental policy outlines an organisation’s commitment to sustainable practices and sets a foundation for measurable, environmentally responsible objectives. It serves not only as a formal declaration of environmental goals but also as a practical guide for employees, stakeholders, and external partners. Purpose and Importance of Environmental PolicyAn environmental policy acts as a cornerstone for any Environmental Management System (EMS), such as ISO 14001. It defines an organisation's approach to reducing its environmental impact and helps embed environmental considerations into daily operations and strategic decision-making. By setting a formal policy, organisations also ensure compliance with local and international environmental regulations and position themselves as socially responsible entities. Additionally, such policies can improve relations with stakeholders, enhance brand reputation, and open doors to green investment opportunities.Key Elements of an Effective Environmental Policy Statement of Commitment to Sustainability: A policy should begin with a commitment to protecting the environment and reducing the organisation’s ecological footprint. This includes pledging to reduce pollution, conserve resources, and adopt sustainable practices across all operations. Such a statement reflects the organisation’s dedication to aligning its goals with global sustainability efforts. Compliance With Environmental Regulations: Legal and regulatory compliance is a crucial element, as it ensures the organisation meets all relevant environmental laws. This includes adhering to guidelines from bodies like OSHA, local environmental agencies, and ISO 14001 requirements, ensuring that all operations are within legal limits and that potential environmental risks are minimised. Setting Measurable Environmental Goals: Setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals enables the organisation to track progress effectively. Goals may involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing recycling rates, or improving energy efficiency. Clear, measurable objectives help in ey Elements of an Effective Environmental Policy Continued Scope of the Policy: Defining the policy’s scope involves identifying the boundaries of the organisation's environmental impact. This may include specific operations, processes, locations, and supply chains, ensuring that the policy is tailored to the unique aspects of the organisation’s activities and environmental risks. Roles and Responsibilities: Clear roles and responsibilities ensure accountability at all organisational levels.

Environmental Risk Assessment and Management: Conducting risk assessments to identify and address potential environmental hazards is essential. This includes evaluating processes that could harm the environment and developing preventive measures. Effective risk management helps organisations prioritise actions, allocate resources appropriately, and reduce their overall environmental impact.assessing environmental performance and allow the organisation to make data-driven adjustments for continuous improvement.mmunicating and Implementing the PolicyEmployees play a critical role in environmental performance. Training programs should focus on the importance of sustainability and the specific environmental responsibilities of each role within the organisation. Continuous training, such as workshops or annual seminars, helps employees stay informed about the latest environmental protocols and instils a culture of responsibility.Creating a culture of environmental responsibility requires regular reinforcement. Internal awareness programs can include placing visible signage on environmental procedures, integrating environmental topics into team meetings, and celebrating sustainable achievements within the organisation. Communication channels such as newsletters and internal portals can also serve as reminders, helping keep environmental goals at the forefront.Transparency is crucial for maintaining trust with external stakeholders, including customers, investors, and regulatory bodies. Organisations can communicate their environmental policy through public reports, websites, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) statements. Engaging suppliers and contractors in environmental initiatives also ensure that the organisation’s environmental standards are reflected across its entire supply chain.Role of Management in EMS Implementation In implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS), top management plays a crucial role by setting the vision, allocating resources, and ensuring that environmental goals align with broader business objectives. Active management engagement helps to create a culture of environmental stewardship, integrate the EMS with operational strategies, and establish effective monitoring and evaluation practices.Leadership and Environmental Stewardship Leadership is foundational to EMS success, as ISO 14001 emphasises that senior management must actively demonstrate commitment. Leaders are responsible for establishing the environmental policy, creating a culture that prioritises environmental health, and aligning EMS objectives with organisational values and goals. This involves visible support for initiatives, such as approving budgets for EMS projects, dedicating staff to EMS roles, and promoting environmental best practices across departments. Management’s commitment helps to foster an organisational culture of accountability and shared responsibility for environmental outcomes.Integrating EMS With Business Strategy To ensure the EMS is effective, environmental objectives should align with and support the organisation’s broader business strategy. Management should incorporate sustainability into decision-making processes, including product development, expansion plans, and supply chain management. For instance, using sustainable materials or energy-efficient processes can help an organisation reduce its environmental footprint while enhancing its market position. Such strategic alignment not only improves environmental outcomes but also supports business resilience by ensuring that environmental considerations are embedded in core business practices.Monitoring, Review, and EvaluationA robust EMS requires systematic monitoring and continuous improvement. Management must establish clear metrics and conduct regular reviews to ensure the EMS meets its objectives. Key components include:
Performance Metrics: Management sets Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for environmental impacts, such as energy consumption, waste generation, and emissions levels. These metrics enable the organisation to quantify environmental performance and identify areas for improvement.Management Reviews: Regular reviews are essential for evaluating EMS effectiveness and alignment with strategic goals. During these reviews, leaders assess audit findings, stakeholder feedback, and overall compliance with environmental objectives. Adjustments to the EMS may be made based on these evaluations to improve environmental impact and ensure policies remain relevant.Corrective and Preventive Actions: Addressing non-compliance or inefficiencies as they arise is crucial for EMS integrity. Corrective actions might involve immediate improvements, such as updating equipment or revising protocols. Preventive measures focus on identifying potential issues before they occur, such as implementing routine audits and conducting employee training on new standards. This continuous cycle of evaluation and correction supports a proactive approach to environmental management and compliance.Reducing Environmental ImpactEnvironmental impact reduction involves strategies that focus on waste management, energy efficiency, sustainable sourcing, and green technology adoption. Continuous Improvement in Environmental Management Continuous improvement is essential to maintaining and advancing the effectiveness of an Environmental Management System (EMS). It enables organisations to adapt to evolving environmental standards, optimise resource usage, and foster a proactive culture of environmental responsibility. This section covers the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, methods for identifying improvement opportunities, and the importance of meticulous documentation and reportingLesson SummaryThe main points covered in the module are:
Environmental management in the workplace integrates practices to minimise environmental impact and adhere to regulations.ISO 14001 provides a structured framework for organisations to manage environmental responsibilities and improve sustainability.Key elements of ISO 14001 include leadership commitment, planning, operational controls, performance evaluation, and continual improvement.Effective environmental policies outline sustainability goals, compliance with laws, and roles within the organisation.Management's role is critical for setting a sustainable vision, allocating resources, and aligning EMS with business strategies.Strategies to reduce environmental impact include waste management, energy conservation, and sustainable sourcing.The PDCA cycle ensures continuous improvement in environmental management, supported by proper documentation and reporting.Workplace Mental Health and Psychosocial HazardsWorkplace mental health focuses on managing psychosocial hazards and fostering a supportive work environment. These specialised topics delve into the types of hazards, risk assessment practices, intervention strategies, evaluation methods, and the role of organisational culture in promoting mental well-being.Psychosocial Risk Assessments Conducting psychosocial risk assessments is a critical step in identifying workplace mental health risks. These assessments allow organisations to pre-emptively address risks that could impact employee well-being, reduce productivity, and increase turnover. Using tools aligned with global standards, such as ISO 45003, organisations can better manage these risks in line with broader Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) policiesPurpose of Psychosocial Risk AssessmentsThe primary aim of psychosocial risk assessments is to identify potential risks to mental health within the workplace, enabling organisations to develop appropriate preventive and protective measures. This process considers factors like workload, organisational support, and interpersonal dynamics that contribute to stress and other psychological challenges. By understanding these risks, organisations can implement strategies to create a safe and supportive environment, which has been shown to enhance employee engagement and reduce absenteeism.In line with international standards, such as ISO 45003 and Safe Work Australia guidelines, psychosocial risk management prioritises minimising job demands and maximising job resources. Organisations gain actionable insights by assessing risk levels and can implement interventions that promote well-being and compliance with health and safety regulations.Steps in Conducting a Psychosocial Risk AssessmentA structured, step-by-step approach is essential for effective psychosocial risk assessment:
 Data Collection: This foundational step uses surveys, interviews, and direct observations to gather qualitative and quantitative data on workplace conditions. Surveys like the People at Work tool and the Job Content Questionnaire are popular choices designed to capture insights into job demands, role clarity, and employee satisfaction. Organisations often benefit from supplementing surveys with focus groups, which allow employees to discuss specific stressors and suggest practical solutions tailored to their work environment. Risk Identification: Analysing data from surveys and feedback sessions helps identify potential psychosocial hazards, including job demands, management practices, and organisational culture. This step emphasises examining the frequency, duration, and intensity of exposure to these hazards, as employees are impacted differently depending on their roles and responsibilities. Analysis and Prioritisation: Once identified, risks are ranked according to their severity and likelihood, allowing organisations to prioritise hazards that require immediate intervention. Using a risk matrix for psychosocial factors similar to those used for physical hazards enables a clear visual representation of which risks are most critical. This prioritisation ensures resources are allocated effectively, focusing on high-impact areas that significantly affect mental health.Tools and MethodologiesSeveral validated tools and methodologies can streamline the psychosocial risk assessment process:
Employee Surveys: Tools like People at Work are evidence-based and widely adopted, allowing organisations to collect extensive data on psychosocial hazards and benchmark their findings against similar industries. Surveys are usually followed up with qualitative methods, such as focus groups, to clarify findings and design specific action plans.Feedback and Focus Groups: Following surveys, focus groups engage employees in discussions around identified risks. This collaborative process helps tailor solutions to fit actual workplace needs, which is especially important since psychosocial hazards can be subjective and vary greatly across different teams.Job Content Questionnaire: Used in various workplaces, this questionnaire helps organisations assess role-specific risks by focusing on job demands and control, social support, and reward structures. It provides a structured approach to data collection, which is crucial for developing targeted interventions.Strategies to Support Workplace Mental HealthPromoting mental health within the workplace not only benefits employees but also enhances overall productivity, reduces absenteeism, and fosters a positive organisational culture. The upcoming slides contains key strategies to build and sustain a mentally healthy work environment. Developing a Supportive EnvironmentCreating a supportive environment involves building a culture where employees feel comfortable discussing mental health issues without fear of judgment or reprisal. This open communication helps employees feel valued and supported, which can significantly mitigate stress and improve morale.Open Communication: Establishing clear communication channels encourages employees to discuss their concerns. Regular check-ins by managers and open-door policies signal to employees that their mental health is a priority. Anonymous feedback options, like suggestion boxes or digital surveys, allow employees to express concerns safely, creating transparency and building trust.Positive Workplace Culture: Fostering a culture of inclusion and respect reinforces a supportive environment. Emphasising diversity, teamwork, and recognition of achievements can enhance employee morale. Creating spaces for team-building activities and celebrating successes encourages a sense of belonging and reduces feelings of isolation.Physical Workspace Adjustments: Designing a workspace that supports well-being through ergonomic furniture, natural lighting, and relaxation spaces helps reduce stress and increase comfort. Elements like plants, breakout areas, and comfortable seating can enhance the physical environment, contributing to mental wellnesProviding Training and Resources Ensuring that employees have access to resources and training for mental health enables them to manage stress and develop resilience. Here are several initiatives to consider:Resilience and Stress Management Training: Providing training sessions on resilience and stress management equips employees with skills to cope effectively with workplace pressures. These sessions, which can cover mindfulness, time management, and emotional intelligence, help employees navigate stressful situations more effectively and can reduce burnout. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs): EAPs are comprehensive support programs that offer confidential counselling services to employees dealing with work or personal issues. EAPs often include access to mental health professionals, which can be crucial for employees managing complex stressors. Studies have shown that EAPs not only improve employee well-being but also enhance productivity and morale. Mental Health Awareness Campaigns: Launching awareness campaigns educates employees on recognising mental health challenges and the resources available to them. Campaigns can include workshops, informational emails, and posters that normalise mental health discussions and encourage employees to seek help when needed. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is one initiative that trains employees to provide peer support, creating an additional layer of workplace supportEvaluating Mental Health InterventionsEvaluating mental health interventions is critical for ensuring their effectiveness and adapting them as necessary. Effective evaluations combine quantitative metrics, such as employee engagement, and qualitative insights, like feedback from interviews. The ongoing assessment allows organisations to refine mental health strategies, optimising resources and enhancing employee well-being.Key Performance Indicators for Mental HealthKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) for mental health interventions help measure their impact on employee well-being and workplace outcomes. They provide actionable insights, allowing organisations to identify strengths and areas for improvement: Employee Feedback and Satisfaction: Use regular, anonymous surveys (pulse surveys, focus groups) to gather employee feedback on mental health programs. These insights can reveal satisfaction levels and highlight specific areas needing improvement. Absenteeism and Sick Leave Rates: Track and analyse absenteeism due to mental health concerns. Reductions in these rates can indicate effective support, while increases may signal unresolved issues that require attention. Employee Turnover Rate: Measure how mental health interventions impact employee retention. Lower turnover rates suggest that employees feel valued and suBuilding a Culture of Mental Well-Being A culture that values mental well-being is fundamental to supporting employees, reducing stigma around mental health, and promoting a supportive work environment. By developing awareness, aligning policies with ISO 45003, and ensuring proactive management support, organisations can create a foundation for sustained mental wellness.pported, while high turnover may indicate dissatisfaction with workplace mental health support.Promoting Awareness and Reducing StigmaCreating awareness and reducing the stigma around mental health encourages open discussions and acceptance:
Educational Campaigns: Organising events like Mental Health Awareness Month and offering workshops on mental health topics educates employees about the importance of mental wellness and available resources. Campaigns can include posters, emails, and guest talks by mental health professionals to demystify mental health topics and foster acceptance.Visible Leadership Support: When senior management actively supports mental health initiatives, it sets a powerful example, showing employees that mental health is taken seriously. Leadership’s open support, such as sharing personal mental health journeys or participating in mental wellness events, normalises conversations around mental health and encourages employees to seek help when needed.Peer Support Programs: Introducing peer support groups where employees can share experiences and resources builds a network of empathy and support. These programs, coupled with training on recognising signs of mental distress, help create a more cohesive support structure within teams, reducing isolation aDeveloping Policies Aligned With ISO 45003ISO 45003 provides a structured approach to managing psychosocial risks by integrating mental health policies with Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) systems, which fosters a comprehensive commitment to employee well-being:Policy Frameworks
Integration With OHSE PoliciesFeedback and Adaptability Clear policies outline the organisation’s dedication to mental health, specifying procedures for addressing psychosocial risks, available resources, and protocols for seeking assistance. Policies also establish boundaries for acceptable behaviour, such as zero-tolerance toward harassment, ensuring a respectful and secure environment for all employees.nd increasing collective well-being.Management’s Role in Supporting Mental HealthManagers are essential in creating an environment where mental health is valued and supported. Proactive managerial practices significantly enhance mental wellness across teams:Modelling Positive Behaviours
Regular Check-Ins and EngagementTraining in Mental Health Sensitivity Managers should exemplify healthy work-life balance and stress management techniques, such as taking regular breaks and setting boundaries for work hours. When employees observe these practices, they feel encouraged to adopt similar habits, reinforcing a culture where well-being is prioritisedLesson SummaryThe main points covered in the module are:
OHSE Legal Frameworks: International standards such as OSHA, EU directives, and ISO set the foundation for workplace safety, providing guidelines for regulatory compliance and safety best practices across industries.Employer and Employee Responsibilities: Legal obligations require employers to provide a safe workplace and employees to comply with safety protocols, fostering a cooperative safety culture.Audits and Inspections: Regular audits and inspections help identify workplace hazards, ensure regulatory compliance, and promote continuous safety improvements.Compliance Documentation: Accurate records, including incident reports and training logs, are essential for regulatory compliance, risk management, and transparency.Consequences of Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with OHSE standards can result in severe penalties, reputational harm, operational disruptions, and the need for immediate corrective actions.Corrective and Preventive Actions: Addressing safety violations through corrective and preventive measures strengthens compliance and supports a proactive safety culture.Benefits of Record-Keeping: Proper documentation supports legal compliance, accountability, and helps organisations track and improve safety measures over time.Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Identify the types of occupational health hazards and their impacts on workers' well-being.Explain the hierarchy of controls and its application in reducing workplace hazards.Describe the techniques for assessing exposure to chemical, physical, biological, and ergonomic hazards.Outline the steps for conducting a comprehensive worksite analysis to identify potential hazards.Evaluate the role of engineering, administrative controls, and PPE in hazard management.Summarise the importance of OSHA standards and other exposure limits in ensuring workplace safety.Discuss the significance of record-keeping and compliance audits in maintaining occupational health standards.Recognition and Control of Occupational Health Hazards Industrial environments expose employees to various health hazards that can impact their well-being and productivity. Recognising these hazards and implementing appropriate control strategies is essential for maintaining a safe workplace. The structured approach outlined in the hierarchy of controls helps prioritise methods to reduce or eliminate these risks effectively.Types of Occupational Health HazardsOccupational health hazards fall into several categories, each requiring specific identification techniques and control strategies to ensure worker safety.Chemical hazards stem from exposure to substances like solvents, dust, gases, and fumes, which can enter the body through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Industries such as manufacturing, chemical production, and mining frequently encounter these hazards. Exposure to these chemicals can lead to acute effects, such as respiratory irritation, and chronic conditions, including cancer or organ damage. Control Methods:
Ventilation: Local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation systems help remove airborne contaminants from the workplace.PPE: Respirators, gloves, and protective suits provide personal protection where other controls are insufficient.Substitution: Replacing hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, where feasible, reduces health risks.Types of Occupational Health Hazards ContinuedPhysical hazards include noise, extreme temperatures, radiation, and vibration. These risks are prevalent in construction, manufacturing, and energy sectors. Control Methods:
Noise: Prolonged exposure to high noise levels leads to hearing loss. Dosimeters measure sound levels to assess noise exposure, and ear protection like earmuffs or earplugs helps mitigate risk. Thermal Stress: Working in extreme temperatures can cause heat stress or hypothermia. Solutions include temperature-controlled environments, hydration stations, and rest breaks. Radiation: Industries such as healthcare and nuclear energy encounter radiation risks. Shielding, monitoring devices, and dosimeters are essential for managing exposure.Exposure Assessment TechniquesAssessing exposure levels in the workplace is essential for understanding risk and implementing the most effective control measures. Exposure assessment techniques vary based on the type of hazard, and they provide critical data for determining how much of a hazard is present and how it may impact worker healthControl Measures: Engineering, Administrative and PPEEffective hazard control involves using a hierarchy of controls to manage and mitigate risks in the workplace. This framework prioritises control measures from most to least effective, starting with engineering solutions, followed by administrative strategies, and finally, personal protective equipment (PPE). Engineering ControlsEngineering controls are interventions that aim to isolate or remove hazards from the workplace. These measures are considered the most effective, as they do not rely on individual behaviours and instead focus on controlling the environment.Ventilation Systems: Ventilation helps to manage airborne contaminants, particularly in environments with fumes, dust, or vapours. Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) captures contaminants at their source, directing them away from workers and outside the facility. LEV is crucial in industries like welding, painting, and chemical processing, where specific work areas need targeted ventilation. General Ventilation (also called dilution ventilation) manages overall air quality by diluting contaminants throughout the space, reducing workers' exposure to lower-risk airborne particles.Isolation and Enclosures: Isolating hazardous processes or materials in separate rooms or enclosures limits worker exposure. Isolation Rooms are common in laboratory and healthcare settings to prevent the spread of biological contaminants or hazardous chemicals. For example, containment hoods or glove boxes in labs keep biological and chemical hazards from escaping into the surrounding workspace. These barriers reduce contact with hazardous materials, especially in areas where contaminants are actively handled or generated.Automation and Mechanisation: In industries where repetitive, high-risk tasks are performed (like heavy lifting or exposure to hazardous substances), automation removes workers from direct exposure. Using robotic systems for handling toxic chemicals or heavy equipment reduces human interaction with hazardous processes, improving both safety and efficiency.Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Describe the key principles of ergonomics and their application in workplace design.Identify common ergonomic risk factors and assessment tools for evaluating them.Explain strategies for preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) through ergonomic interventions.Evaluate the effectiveness of hierarchical control strategies in reducing ergonomic risks.Outline the essential components of ergonomic workstation setups for both office and industrial environments.Discuss the importance of promoting ergonomics awareness and employee involvement.Summarise real-world case studies that illustrate the impact of ergonomic improvements. 1.

Ergonomics involves designing work environments that fit employees’ needs to reduce strain and improve safety.Principles of ergonomics integrate physiology, biomechanics, anthropometry, and psychology to create supportive workspaces.Benefits of ergonomic design include enhanced safety, productivity, reduced absenteeism, and improved job satisfaction.Common risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include repetitive movements, static postures, and excessive force.Tools such as RULA, QEC, and the NIOSH Lifting Equation help assess ergonomic risks and inform targeted interventions.7. Case Studies and Real-Lesson SummaryThe main points covered in the module are: Accident prevention and investigation are essential for reducing workplace injuries and operational disruptions.Theories of accident causation, such as Heinrich’s Domino Theory, the Swiss Cheese Model, and Human Factors Theory, help identify contributing factors and prevent future incidents.Accident prevention includes both proactive measures (e.g., safety audits, risk assessments) and reactive measures (e.g., incident investigation and corrective action).Conducting an accident investigation involves securing the scene, collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses, and reporting findings to identify root causes.Safety audits, including internAccident Causation ModelsAccident causation theories serve as frameworks to help safety professionals understand the root causes of workplace incidents. By studying these models, organisations can develop targeted strategies for risk mitigation, aiming to prevent accidents before they happen or minimise their impact when they do. Below are some of the most recognised theories in accident causation. Heinrich’s Domino Theory Overview:Developed by H.W. Heinrich in the 1930s, Domino Theory suggests that accidents occur due to a chain of events, much like a sequence of falling dominos. According to Heinrich, these dominos include factors such as social environment, faults of individuals, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, and, finally, the accident itself. If one of these dominos is removed such as an unsafe act or condition the accident sequence can be stopped. Applications: Domino Theory underscores the importance of intervening at any step in the chain to prevent accidents. For instance, providing additional training to employees or eliminating an unsafe condition on the production floor can prevent the final “domino,” or accident, from falling.al and external audits, help organisations evaluate compliance and identify areas for safety improvement.Steps in Conducting Accident Investigations Introduction teps in Conducting Accident InvestigationsSecuring the scene immediately after an accident is crucial to prevent further harm and preserve evidence for accurate investigation.I. Securing the SceneInitial Safety Measures: In the moments following an accident, it is essential to restrict access to the area to protect employees and prevent additional injuries. This may involve setting up barriers, marking the area with caution tape, and implementing an emergency response if there are hazards present, such as chemical spills, broken equipment, or fire risks. Restricting access also ensures that evidence remains undisturbed for the investigation.Preserving Evidence: Preserving the integrity of the scene is key to an accurate investigation. Investigators should document the scene by taking photographs, drawing diagrams, and noting the exact locations of objects, tools, or equipment involved. Physical evidence, such as damaged machinery or spilled substances, should be left untouched until recorded. Investigators may also collect samples or secure digital records (e.g., CCTV footage) to aid in recreating the incident. Steps in Conducting Accident Investigations ContinuedComprehensive evidence collection is vital for understanding what occurred and identifying the causes behind the incident.II. Evidence Collection and DocumentationPhysical Evidence Collection: Investigators should gather any materials, equipment, or substances that may have contributed to the incident. This includes items such as faulty tools, broken machine parts, or hazardous materials that were involved in the event. Each item should be carefully documented with details like serial numbers or damage descriptions to help trace the incident's origin.Witness Statements: Witnesses often provide valuable insights into the incident. Statements should be recorded from anyone who saw the event or was involved. To obtain accurate information, investigators should use open-ended questions that allow witnesses to describe the incident in their own words. Investigators should avoid leading questions that could influence responses. Witness statements add context to physical evidence and can reveal situational factors, such as behavioural patterns or environmentalAccident investigations follow a structured process to uncover the causes behind incidents, enabling organisations to implement corrective measures and prevent future occurrences. This process involves securing the accident scene, gathering evidence, conducting interviews, and compiling findings into a detailed report.ps in Conducting Accident Investigations ContinuedInterviewing involved parties is a critical part of the investigation process, as it uncovers details that may not be immediately visible in physical evidence.III. Conducting Effective InterviewsInterview Techniques: Effective interviews require a non-judgmental approach to create a comfortable environment for honesty. Investigators should avoid expressing opinions or making assumptions and instead focus on asking open-ended questions to obtain detailed responses. Examples include, "Can you describe what you observed just before the accident?" or "What steps did you take prior to the incident?"Common Pitfalls in Interviews: Bias and assumptions can skew interview findings, leading to inaccurate conclusions. Investigators should avoid asking questions that suggest blame or assume causation, such as "Did you do this?" Instead, they should keep questions neutral, allowing witnesses to recount events without feeling defensive. Additionally, paying attention to non-verbal cues and recording responses accurately are critical for unbiased results. Steps in Conducting Accident Investigations ContinuedAfter gathering all relevant evidence, the final stage involves analysing findings to uncover root causes and compiling a comprehensive report.IV. Analysis and ReportingData Organisation: Evidence, including physical items, photographs, and witness statements, should be systematically organised to create a clear narrative of the incident. This process often involves grouping evidence by timeline or causative factors to identify patterns. Proper data organisation is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions and ensuring the report remains coherent and accessible.Initial Findings and Conclusions: Based on the compiled evidence, investigators can draw preliminary conclusions about what led to the incident. This stage involves identifying any immediate (surface) causes, such as equipment malfunction, as well as deeper root causes, such as lack of maintenance or inadequate training. The findings are then used to create an initial draft report, which outlines the sequence of events, analysis, and recommended corrective actions.Report Compilation: The final report should include a detailed account of the incident, supported by evidence and witness statements. The report should also include root cause analysis, preventive measures, and follow-up recommendations to avoid similar incidents in the future. This document not only serves as an internal resource for safety improvements but also provides essential documentation for regulatory compliance and future safety audits.Root Cause Analysis TechniquesRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) is a structured process that identifies underlying causes of incidents. It ensures organisations address not just the immediate issues but also systemic problems to prevent recurrences. Effective RCA goes beyond superficial fixes, addressing the root issues that allow workplace hazards to persist. Identifying Surface and Root CausesAccurate identification of both surface and root causes is crucial in Root Cause Analysis Techniques Root Cause Analysis (RCA), as it distinguishes between visible symptoms and the deeper issues that give rise to these symptoms. Surface vs. Root Cause DifferentiationSurface causes refer to the immediate factors that directly led to an incident. For example, a slip-and-fall accident might be attributed to a spilled liquid on the floor (surface cause). However, Root Cause Analysis Techniques Root Cause Analysis (RCA) would probe deeper, uncovering possible root causes, such as inadequate cleaning protocols, poor training on spill response, or insufficient warning signs, which contributed to the spill not being addressed in time.Surface CausesRoot CauseDirect factors such as broken machinery, missing signage, or improper storage that may cause immediate hazards.Systemic factors like poor training, inadequate maintenance procedures, or flawed organisational practices that allow surface causes to persist.Click on this Modal to learn moreRoot Cause Analysis MethodsSeveral methodologies assist in systematically identifying root causes, each suited to different types of incidents and workplace environments. Two commonly used methods are the 5 Whys Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Root Cause Analysis Methods (5 Whys Analysis)The 5 Whys method involves asking “why” repeatedly (typically five times) to drill down to the root cause. Each answer leads to the next question, helping uncover the systemic issues behind an incident. Application: This method is straightforward, making it suitable for incidents with a single causal path. For example, if an employee falls from a ladder, the 5 Whys could reveal inadequate ladder maintenance or lack of safety training as the root cause. The iterative questioning process is particularly effective for exploring less complex issues. Limitations: While useful, the 5 Whys can oversimplify complex incidents, as it may not identify multiple contributing factors. It’s essential to use this method in combination with other tools when dealing with multifaceted problems. Example: In the case of a machine malfunction: Why did the machine malfunction? – Because a part broke.Why did the part break? – Due to inadequate lubrication.Why was there inadequate lubrication? – Because maintenance schedules were skipped.Why were maintenance schedules skipped? – Due to a shortage of staff.Why was there a staff shortage? – Lack of budget allocation for the maintenance department.In this example, the root cause is identified as inadequate budgeting, which can be addressed to prevent similar issues in the future.Practical Case ApplicationsPractical applications of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) demonstrate its relevance in diverse industries, underscoring its adaptability to specific workplace scenarios and hazards.Practical Case Applications - Manufacturing IndustryIn manufacturing, RCA is instrumental in addressing incidents like equipment breakdowns, quality control issues, and worker safety incidents. For example:Case Example: A production line stops due to repeated equipment failures. RCA using FTA may reveal several root causes, including inconsistent maintenance schedules, the use of substandard parts from a supplier, and an outdated machine model.Corrective Actions: Adjusting the maintenance schedule, improving supplier quality assurance, and replacing outdated machinery can enhance productivity, reduce repair costs, and prevent future disruptions. Application in Different Manufacturing Settings: Assembly Line: RCA can address frequent quality defects by uncovering root causes in training, material quality, or equipment calibration.Heavy Machinery: For breakdowns or safety incidents, RCA might reveal root issues like inadequate training for operators, missing safeguards, or insufficient inspections.Practical Case Applications - Construction IndustryIn construction, RCA is critical for investigating incidents involving falls, equipment accidents, and structural failures. It’s used to assess both human and procedural factors in high-risk activities.Case Example: An incident involving a scaffolding collapse. While initial assessment may suggest a structural flaw, RCA reveals that the collapse was due to a combination of insufficient inspection protocols and lack of worker training on proper scaffold assembly.Corrective Actions: Addressing these root causes involves enhancing inspection schedules, mandating certified training on scaffold assembly, and implementing stricter safety protocols. This leads to safer work practices and reduces future incidents. Application in Different Construction Scenarios: Heavy Lifting Equipment: RCA can uncover root causes of equipment failure, such as operator error, mechanical faults, or poor maintenance practices.Electrical Safety: In incidents involving electrical faults, RCA might reveal root issues like outdated wiring, lack of proper grounding, or insufficient PPE for electricians.Practical Case Applications - Energy SectorIn the energy industry, RCA is widely applied in scenarios involving equipment malfunctions, safety hazards, and environmental incidents, especially in high-risk areas like oil and gas extraction.Case Example: An oil rig experiences a safety incident due to a blowout. RCA, particularly FTA, helps map out contributing factors such as mechanical failure, operational errors, and procedural gaps in emergency response.Corrective Actions: Root causes might be addressed by upgrading equipment, refining operational protocols, and enhancing training for emergency responses. This approach reduces the chance of repeat incidents and protects both workers and the environment. Application in Different Energy Industry Scenarios: Pipeline Leaks: RCA can reveal causes like corrosion, material defects, or monitoring lapses.Electrical Failures: In power plants, RCA might uncover root issues like inadequate maintenance, lack of surge protection, or insufficient training on shutdown procedures.Implementation of Corrective ActionsEffective corrective actions address both immediate and long-term safety improvements, ensuring that root causes are systematically eliminated and similar incidents do not recur.Immediate Corrective Measures
Long-Term Preventive Actions
Immediate actions are taken to rectify hazards identified during RCA, such as fixing broken equipment, updating signage, or providing refresher training on specific safety protocols. These actions mitigate immediate risks and establish a safer work environment in the short term.

Example: After an RCA determines that inadequate PPE contributed to an incident involving chemical exposure, immediate corrective actions may include issuing proper PPE to affected employees aImplementation of Corrective Actions ContinuedPolicy and Procedural Changes: Based on RCA findings, organisations may need to revise policies or procedures. If poor maintenance scheduling is identified as a root cause, a long-term action could involve implementing a more robust, systematic maintenance schedule.Regular Follow-Up and Monitoring: Periodic reviews ensure that corrective actions are effective and adjustments are made as needed. Conducting follow-up audits and performance reviews ensures that improvements are sustained and that any new issues are promptly addressed.nd ensuring immediate compliance with PPE guidelines.Reporting and DocumentationAccurate reporting and thorough documentation form the backbone of an effective occupational health and safety (OHSE) system. They serve as the formal records of incidents, corrective actions, and preventive measures, supporting regulatory compliance, reducing liability risks, and ensuring continuous improvement in workplace safety. Importance of Detailed ReportingComprehensive reporting provides an accurate account of incidents, which is essential for identifying patterns, implementing corrective measures, and maintaining compliance with OHSE regulations.Accident reports are structured documents designed to capture comprehensive information about workplace incidents. A well-organised accident report typically includes:Key Components: An effective accident report includes the incident description (what happened, where, and when), findings (evidence gathered and root cause analysis), and recommendations (suggested corrective and preventive actions).Incident Description: Detailed information about what occurred, where, when, and the individuals involved. This section documents specific circumstances leading to the event, such as weather conditions, equipment used, and time of day.Findings and Observations: An account of the immediate findings from the incident, including contributing factors, hazards identified, and witness statements. Accurate findings allow investigators to build a clear understanding of the incident.Root Cause Analysis and Recommendations: Suggested actions to address the underlying cause(s) of the incident. Recommendations may include specific control measures, policy updates, or further training requirements to prevent similar incidents in the future.Legal Implications of Accurate ReportingAccurate and detailed reporting is essential for regulatory compliance and legal protection. Many regulatory bodies, like OSHA and the HSE, require organisations to maintain specific documentation for incidents and corrective actions. Detailed records can: Aid in Regulatory Compliance: Meeting the specific reporting requirements of bodies like OSHA or HSE in the UK helps organisations avoid penalties and supports transparency. Detailed records not only show compliance with safety standards but also build trust with regulatory authorities, stakeholders, and employees.Protect Against Legal Liabilities: Accurate reports are critical for demonstrating compliance with regulatory standards. In case of legal scrutiny, well-documented accident reports can provide evidence of due diligence and proactive safety management, helping to avoid or mitigate liability.Types of DocumentationVarious types of documentation support a comprehensive OHSE management system, helping track safety issues, corrective measures, and improvements over time.Incident Logs
Corrective Action Reports

Upon completion of this module you will be able to:Compare and contrast medium and low voltage systems for power distribution. 
Describe redundancy levels. 
Identify the elements of power supply transfer. 
Identify power distribution topologies. 
Identify and apply electrical protection techniques. 
Discuss preventative maintenance procedures for power distribution componenPower DistributionPower distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source—either externally from the utility or internally from generators—and then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load. 
In a Critical Operations Infrastructure, power is generally supplied via the local utility substation to the facility at a predetermined and fixed voltage. From there, the power must be harnessed, distributed, and stepped down to various voltages suitable for the customer's critical load, and that's where the various components of the power distribution come in—components including uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), substations, power distribution units (PDUs), electrical switchgear, transformers, circuit breakers, power supply cables, and other equipment that you'll learn more about. PDUSA power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs— typically in the form of outlets—designed to distribute electrical power to multiple devices. 
Generally a PDU in an A/C circuit is engineered with a power transformer to step down 480VAC to 120/208VAC to provide conditioned power from a centralized UPS or generator to racks and computers of network equipment. A PDU may have the capability to accommodate power supply to multiple equipment racks or server cabinets. 
PDUs vary in design and use, and may be as simple as inexpensive rack-mounted power strips to much larger and expensive floor-mounted machines with complex functions. Fig. 3.2 - A cabinet PDU, shown with its door open, is designed to support a much larger-scale power distribution syLow Voltage vs. Medium Voltage SystemsClick on the following tabs to explore how these systems differ:Low VoltageMedium VoltageIn the context of critical environments, low voltage electrical systems are generally categorized as those systems operating at voltages up to 1000 volts (or 1kV). 
Power coming from the utility-source is delivered at a much higher voltage (typically closer to that of a medium voltage system) so it must be stepped down to low voltage, which can be done via a three phase transformer in the low voltage system. 
The low voltage bus (a device in the power system that evaluates the voltage, current, or flow of energy within the system) then distributes this stepped down electrical power to the various loads in the facility, such as IT equipment loads, PDU converters, lighting, and cooling systems.
N.B. Attempting to define low voltage, medium voltage, and high voltage can be tricky because these levels vary depending on specific application guidelines, the context of the application, and sometimes even the electrical parameters that have been determined by the authority having jurisdiction.Multiple-Source and Multiple-Feed PowerIn the ideal situation, the critical facility will be fed from multiple power sources—maybe even more than one power plant. Additionally, the substations, switches, transformers and UPSs within a specific system will influence how electrical power is transferred to and throughout the facility. Dependent upon the design, quantity, placement, and redundancy capabilities of each will define the true meaning of multiple-source or multiple-feed power.Note: Redundancy refers to the "extra" components of a system that are typically used solely for backup during critical times, like an outage or failure. It will be covered in greater detail in the next topic. There are four types of multiple-source/multiple-feed power configurations, each with their own distinguishing characteristics: Single feed/single substationMultiple feed/single substationMultiple substationTrue dual/multiple feedSingle Feed/Single SubstationIn this configuration, a facility is supported by one substation with a single power line and a single input feed to the utility transformer(s). 
Facilities that are supplied power in this manner can be vulnerable to a high risk of failure and critical operations interruption. While it might be supported by multiple transformers (giving it the appearance of backup redundancy), if this single substation and single feed failed to provide power, all equipment downstream would fail as well. Multiple SubstationIn this configuration, there are two power lines (one from each substation), single input feeds to each transformer, and one throw-over switch connecting the two substation outputs. Upon a substation failure, the throw-over switch will manually or automatically transfer to connect to the other substation.
Facilities supported by multiple substations gain the advantage of increased redundancy with limited single point failure opportunities. In this case, the throw-over switch is the most prominent single failure source. Failing to transfer after a substation power interruption will create the necessity for the facility to rotate to an alternative source of electrical generation to maintain the critical load.Redundancy and Power Supply TransferWhen it comes to providing power to your Critical Operations system, one of the most important things you need to consider is how to ensure that power is always being consistently supplied. As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the concept of redundancy as a method for maintaining stable power and distributing it appropriately throughout your power system and selecting the appropriate scheme for your facility's needs. In this topic, you will identify redundancy levels. Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 

In the world of Critical Operations, however, the concept of redundancy is much more multi-faceted than the word “extra” implies. How many components of a system have redundancy? Is it just extra capacity or really extra equipment? Does the extra equipment sit idle in standby, or can it be used for non¬critical functions until called upon in the event of a failure? To what extent can a single fault take out the primary component and the redundant component?Redundancy LevelsMost of the Critical Operations industries are converging towards a common language regarding redundancy and the different variations, or levels, of redundancy. This means a facilities technician can walk from a power plant to a data center to a critical manufacturing facility and understand very quickly what equipment is actually being used out on the floor when the operations manager describes the designed redundancy.Note: Redundancy levels in regard to mechanical and controls systems have essentially the same meaning as they are described here, in terms of power distribution systems.These various levels of redundancy include the following: N N+12N2(N+1)N is to redundancy discussions as the variable “x” is to mathematics: a given or basic number of some thing(s). N redundancy means just that: the basic number of some type of device or equipment (be it generators, UPSs, chillers, etc.) required to support and operate the critical infrastructure. 
In this case, the number of items is more limiting than capacity. For instance, an MCO facility that requires 2 MW of power for its critical infrastructure with a single 5 MW generator is only operating at N redundancy; that same facility is still operating at N redundancy if it uses two 1.5 MW generators because while it has an extra piece of equipment, it is not supporting two times the critical load.Dual-Cord SupplyWhen you get down to the level of an individual piece of equipment, redundancy can get a bit tricky. Utilizing a dual-cord supply scheme is the most common approach for high-technology equipment and literally refers to plugging that piece of equipment in twice. When utilizing dual-cord supply, there is a basic method and a preferred method. In almost any piece of equipment, there is usually an internal power supply of some sort behind the power cord connection that takes the supplied power and converts it to what the machine needs to run on (AC vs. DC, a particular voltage, wattage, etc.). The machine will therefore need two of these. 
The basic method to establish redundancy is to have this configuration and plug both cords into the same supply circuit. The preferred method is for each of these cords to be connected to separate power circuits, so that there is redundancy if the machine's power supply component fails, but also if one of the circuits in an MCO system goes down. There are two situations where dual-cord supply is important and therefore often implemented: with medical equipment and data center equipment. Medical equipment tops the list of candidates for dual-cord supply, simply because there may be one or more lives at risk. Not all medical equipment is highly sensitive to losing power for fractions of a second, but if a life-support system or surgical device went offline for even a few seconds or minutes, the results could be deadly. 
Additionally, when it comes to complex modern medical technologies, it's not just about how long power is lost, but whether or not the start-up cycle time for that equipment is lengthy enough to have equally terrible consequences. Power Supply TransferWith a strong understanding of the fundamentals of power distribution and redundancy, you can then begin to explore what to do if there is any interruption to the stable power being delivered through the system. In the event of some sort of power outage, having the ability to easily switch between the primary power source and the backup power source is of the utmost importance. 
As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the basics of power supply transfer, including the various components that can be used to perform this important function. In this topic, you will identify the elements of power supply transfer.
Click on the following tabs to explore different kinds of power supply transfers:Closed Transition Transfer Switch Closed transition is a method of switching between two power sources utilizing the “make before break” method of transfer. A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power. If these conditions are met within tolerances, the switch contacts close or “make” with a slight overlap for transfer to prevent any interruption of supplied service. Open Transition Transfer SwitchSoft Loading Transfer SwitchInterlocksClick on the following tabs to learn about interlocks:Critical Power InterlocksTrapped Key InterlocksAn interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage. This is achieved by utilizing two circuit breakers that are interlocked so that only one can close at a time. In this manner, an interlock system maintains the critical load during a power outage, while prohibiting the circuit breakers from being powered by two different sources at the same time while connecting to the load. 
In the case of an electrical transfer from utility power to generator, the interlock system will enable a safe disconnect from the utility feed to the emergency generator power without the two sources connecting to each other. This separation eliminates the possibility of electrical back feed which can be extremely dangerous to personnel and cause catastrophic damage to critical equipment.Note: Trapped Key Interlocks are commonly referred to as Kirk Keys. Kirk Keys are a specific brand of trapped key interlocking systems, but having been around for over a century, many Critical Operations personnel have gotten into the habit of referring to all trapped key interlock systems, regardless of manufacturer, as Kirk Keys. Power Distribution Topologies Now that you know about the concepts of redundancy and the components of power distribution and transfer, it's time to think about how all these components go together to provide the necessary redundancy for your Critical Operations system. 
As a facilities operator, it is important for you to understand the concept of a topology and select the appropriate schema that will successfully support your facility in the event of an emergency. In this topic, you will identify the various power distribution topologies. Power Distribution Topology The topology of systems refers to more than just what is in a system: it focuses on how and why things are laid out and connected the way they are. Specific to power distribution, then, this refers to the specific design of the power distribution system, made in such a manner that it offers the most optimal operations. 
With this in mind, a Critical Operations design may include the best equipment available and extra components for redundancy, but the next step in mitigating risk and ensuring reliability is a well-defined topology that takes into consideration more than just a piece of equipment breaking down.  
Redundancy is only one part of topology reliability designs—we do want extra equipment, after all. Taking steps to protect parts of systems, or other systems, from nearby faults is how we take steps toward higher and higher levels of reliability. In this vein, there are four different topologies or "tiers" of design that are commonly used in power distribution (and that are applicable to other system designs): basic, redundant, concurrent maintainability, and fault tolerant. For simplicity's sake, we'll look at each of these topologies using a single Critical Operation example utilizing generators and associated generator switchgear for distribution, with a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load.Note: The Uptime Institute—a consortium of companies that oversee the education and certification of enterprise data center professionals—has perhaps the most well-defined and widely recognized system for design topology analysis. The Tier System they have developed has four levels corresponding to the major levels of reliability: Tier I–Basic, Tier II–Redundant, Tier III–Concurrently Maintainable, and Tier IV–Fault Tolerant. A full description of the tier classification system, the tier classifications, and the process for site certification analysis is included in an appendix, reprinted with permission from the Uptime Institute.Basic TopologyBasic topology for the example facility (generators, associated switchgear, and a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load) gives us just enough to keep things running—perhaps two 2.5 MW generators connected to a single generator switchgear. During a loss of power—while, hopefully, a UPS system is carrying the load—the generators fire up and supply the whole power distribution system from a single connection. While this is better than no back up, for sure, a basic topology is just barely an acceptable option.Redundant TopologyGiven the desired level of N + 1 redundancy when the design allows for it at the example critical facility, you would need at least one extra unit beyond N. Redundant topology for this facility would be three 2.5 MW generators sharing a common connection to the generator switchgear. Upon a loss of power, all three generators would come online to power the facility (most likely, but the logic could call for just two, keeping one in ready standby), but a fault on one unit will still leave sufficient capacity to carry all the critical load. In this manner of thinking, a redundant topology is a good option.  Static Transfer SwitchConcurrently Maintainable Topology Fig. 3.12 - A concurrently maintainable topology. Concurrently maintainable topology takes it one step further by adding isolation points around the pieces of equipment in a system with redundancy. As the name implies, this allows for maintenance or repair of equipment without taking the entire system out of service. In the Critical Operation example, each of the three generators would certainly have output isolation breakers, but would also have an additional means of separation at the generator switchgear—perhaps additional breaker cubicles that isolate each conductor connection from the switchgear. 
By opening both of those breakers, Critical Operations technicians could safely work on a single unit without compromising the system's ability to fully support its design function (although, redundancy may be affected). Acknowledging notable additional cost, some Critical Operations might push a very rigid view of cFault Tolerant TopologyA fault tolerant topology has the most strenuous design considerations put into place; basically referring to a design in which a single fault would not take out an entire system. From a redundancy perspective, we would see 2(N + 1) for all equipment and components in the system. In the Critical Operations example, there would be two sets of three 2.5 MW generators (for a total of six units), with each set having its own separate generator switchgear. The two units would most likely be connected by a normally closed “tie-breaker” between them, with the ability to supply the power distribution system from either end. 

Not only does the Critical Operations team benefit from the aspects of concurrent maintainability, any fault (generator failure, switchgear breaker failure, fault on the switchgear, etc.) only takes out one-half of the system, leaving it with a full N + 1 set of equipment available. In this manner of thinking, the fault tolerant topology is the best option.  Electrical Protection As you start to get further into the design of a system's power distribution scheme—including which critical components will be implemented and how they will be implemented—you need to make sure that you have put the proper protections in place to ensure that every component in the electrical system is operating safely. Any amount of electrical voltage could be hazardous to the people or parts in any given facility, but the voltage in a critical facility is exponentially more dangerous. 
As a facility operator, you will need to know what techniques and devices are available to protect your facility's personnel and critical components from dangerous electrical events. In this topic, you will identify and apply electrical protection techniques.rounding Electrical EquipmentAs you may recall, grounding is the process of removing excess electrical charge from a component or system and distributing it to a larger body capable of receiving that charge. When it comes to your power distribution system, grounding is an extremely important concept, especially due to the higher voltages that you may interact with at this level of the distribution chain. 
In addition to grounding measures in place throughout power distribution systems as a whole, individual electrical equipment should have grounding connections whenever possible to mitigate the risk of damage to the equipment during faults and to disperse any excess charge for personnel safety. In many cases, individual pieces of equipment may be connected directly to those larger facility grounding systems. In this situation, it is imperative that these connections are well-documented and well-designed, so that the pathways of lower electrical potential lead to the ground termination and not back to smaller equipment. 
Equipment may also be grounded locally if need be. For example, a PDU may be located in a hall or closet somewhere between the switchgear and the critical load, but not near the installed grounding system. In this case, the PDU may be grounded to a piece of structural building steel, or just a single copper rod sunk into the subflooOver-Current Protection Fig. 3.14 - In over-current protection, a breaker automatically switches to the off position when the power exceeds the level it can support. Over-current protection is likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with: it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe levels. 
This is most often achieved by a breaker tripping or fuse blowing—the exact same thing you've probably experienced in your own home if you overloaded an outlet. A surge of current through the device triggers the interruption, which likely requires a manual reset.Protective RelaysProtective relays are electromagnetically or electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions. More simply, these are the mechanical devices that open and close breakers in response to undesirable conditions. 
This is generally the means by which breakers are tripped open during protective features such as over-current. Protective relays may also be controlled by logic as part of a response sequence, closing breakers for alternate source after a primary source is tripped due to a fault condition. Surge ProtectionJust like you might have a surge protector at home to protect your electronic devices from harmful spikes in the power supply (typically in the form of a surge-protected power strip), Critical Operations need a form of surge protection to do the same for their critical components. 
A Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) is the industrial equivalent to the surge protector power strip your home electronics are plugged into, and provides electrical protection to connected equipment by buffering and absorbing voltage spikes. There are many variants of TVSS systems available to Critical Operations designers, with a wide range of proprietary technologies (usually to protect specific types of equipment or to mitigate specific types of transients (i.e., momentary changes in the voltage). The basic concept of surge protection—in addition to the specific protections that individual equipment may have—is to have inline devices throughout the power distribution system that act as energy diverters. When a TVSS module senses a condition for which it is configured, it uses some form of switch to quickly divert part or all of the excess voltage away from the connected load, generally to a ground connection.  Power Distribution Preventative Measures Now that you can identify all of the various components of the power distribution system and how to protect them reactively in an emergency event, it is equally important to think about how you can protect them proactively. Preventative maintenance can help ensure that all your critical components are operating safely and effectively, even without the threat of an outage. 

As a facility operator, it is highly likely that your responsibilities will include completing these types of tasks. In this topic, you will identify the preventative maintenance procedures for power distribution Switchgear MaintenanceSwitchgear maintenance involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup, exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular equipment installed. It is generally the most complex, comprehensive, and risk-sensitive preventative maintenance procedures that most critical facilities will experience on their support infrastructure (aside from the more complex maintenance of specialized components such as nuclear reactor refueling, bringing down a satellite tower, moving cryogenic R&D equipment, etc.). As it is difficult, and often dangerous, to methodically work through fully de¬energizing switchgear for personnel safety, this maintenance is typically only done once every few years. Critical Operations managers will take advantage of this rare condition to maintain as many components of this critical component as possible on a tight timeline.Breaker TestingBreaker testing involves physically inspecting a circuit breaker and subjecting it to as many functional checks as possible. 
This is often accomplished during switchgear maintenance schedules because it is much easier and quicker to remove breakers from de-energized cabinets. One sub¬process of breaker testing is injection testing, in which varying levels of voltage, current, and/or resistance are applied to the breaker in order to check that its protective features respond appropriately. Coordination StudiesBreaker coordination studies refer to the analysis of installed breakers, their connected loads, and validating or setting their protective features to operate in proper sequencing. 
For example, breakers that are further down a lineup, and therefore closer to connected load, should generally have lower thresholds or tighter tolerances than those upstream. Similar to selective interlock functions, this allows for isolation of faults closest to the condition, affecting fewer adjacent components. 
Coordination studies should be performed during construction, but are unfortunately not regularly updated with the addition of new equipment. Many Critical Operations, therefore, prefer periodic reviews of the power distribution systems to identify any changes and then adjust settings appropriately.Exercising GeneratorsExercising generators refers to a variety of maintenance activities from short weekly run starts, to load bank tests, to full transfer of connected critical load. It is general best practice to exercise generators to at least a nominal extent on a monthly basis. 
This is a hotly debated topic amongst Critical Operations personnel as there is always some risk. An engine could break during an otherwise innocuous test and inadvertently take a backup power supply away from the facility, or the switchgear could hang up during a full load transfer and force the UPSs to carry the load or cause an outage altogether. With proper equipment-level maintenance, these risks can be minimized, but never prevented. The other side of the argument is: if there is going to be a failure, why not have it during a controlled environment, with competent personnel around, and primary power sources still available? The main points from this module are as follows:Power distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source—either externally from the utility or internally from generators—and then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load.A power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs— typically in the form of outlets—designed to distribute electrical power to multiple devices.
Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 
A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power.
Soft loading is a method of switching between two power sources where a soft loading transfer switch synchronizes and parallels the two independent power sources without the interruption of power, and then transfers the load between the two as it minimizes the momentary variations in the voltage and frequency.
A static transfer switch (STS) utilizes solid state power electronics and silicone controlled rectifiers to transfer power very rapidly without utilizing slower electromechanical means to transfer the power supply.
A soft loading closed transition switch is often utilized to support an automatic transfer of power wAn automatic transfer switch (ATS) automatically transfers electrical power from the primary source (via electromechanical means) to an alternate source such as an emergency generator set.An interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage.

Fuel CellsA fuel cell converts stored chemical energy into electricity using a chemical reaction between positively charged ions and an oxidizing agent. 
Like batteries, they are made up of three segments: the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte; unlike batteries, however, fuel cells require a continuous source of fuel and air to operate. In a fuel cell, the chemical reaction occurs where the three segments interface, such that the fuel is consumed, water or other gases are created as a waste product, and an electric current is produced. As long as the sources are supplied, the fuel cell will continue to produce electrical energy. 
The most common and familiar type of fuel cell is likely the hydrogen fuel cell, which requires hydrogen (H2) fuel and air (O2) as the sources. During the chemical reaction at the segments, some O2 molecules are stripped from the air and some are stripped from the water (H2O) molecules, leaving more H2 to act as fuel. In the end, the remaining broken-apart, ionized hydrogen (H+) and oxygen molecules re-combine to form water as the waste product (which is, unfortunately, non-potable).Fuel cells have been making inroads in several industries—notably, transportation and propulsion, in addition to power generation—due to their capability to make renewable, mostly clean energy (wastewater being the one downfall). For large-scale implementations, fuel cells can be an expensive capital investment but have relatively low cost of operation. Power density is approaching that of traditional diesel/gas generators, so Critical Operations of any size would still require a small array of fuel cells, but they can provide continuous power more indefinitely than generators. Wind PowerWind power also ranks very highly as a clean, sustainable alternative energy source. Wind turbines are simply large fans that convert the mechanical energy of the wind to electricity by turning the rotor of a standard generator. These are highly efficient machines as virtually the only source of energy loss is overcoming friction in turning the rotor. iomassBiomass is a broad term encompassing virtually all renewable, organic materials—from old wood pallets, to discarded crops, to “municipal waste” as the dictionary gently puts it—that can be treated in some manner (shredded, compressed, composted, etc.) and burned for fuel. Then, just like most other power plants, the heat is generally used to drive steam or gas turbines to create electricity.  Fig. 2.22 - The biomass plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina burns forest residue to provide power to the rest of the campus, which produces nuclear materials for the U.S.Department of Energy. SupercapacitorsCapacitors, specifically electrochemical capacitors, are another category of energy storage devices, typically used on smaller scales than batteries. They can store very small amounts of electric potential. For example, think about the minuscule amount of charge it takes for an electronic device to keep track of time. The battery on your phone may have died, or your computer may have been unplugged for weeks, and yet when you connect to a primary power source and boot it up; it still knows what time it is. 
Capacitance—the ability to store some amount of charge—is measured in a unit called the farad (named for the acclaimed 19th century English scientist Michael Faraday).  Co-Generated PowerIn a co-generated power system, some fuel source (nuclear, coal, gas, biomass, etc.) is used to create steam for turbine generators, and then the leftover heat is extracted from the exhausted waste steam (or condensate) and is used to provide power for other central services (such as space heating or water heating). 
Co-generation plants are an economical, if not thrifty, alternative power source that is primarily found in campus settings because of the ability to utilize the co-generated energy to power a central service for multiple buildings on the site, if not the entire campus. 
While it is still not common for most Critical Operations facilities to be generating their own primary power on site (with a few large-scale exceptions), the co-generation concept is one that facilility technicians and operators are finding great success in implementing after the fact. Anything that generates heat can be considered a candidate for co-generation. 
For instance, a communications center that finally decides to install a solar array on the roof could then install a bypass loop to its hot water heater and run tubes within or behind the array to collect its heat. Or machinery with compressors or motors in a manufacturing plant could be hooded in some manner, and ductwork could be put in place to pump the hot air back into people spaces during colder months to augment installed electric heaterThe main points from this module are as follows:Electricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles.Voltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them.
A volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity.
Low voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels.
Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
High voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers.
Electrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire.
Amperes, represented by the shortened term amps or the letter A, is the unit of measure for expressing the flow rate of an electric charge, or current.

Errors are shown in the error list. You can select an error in this list and you will automatically be brought to the line of code where the error is present.
It is important that you have accurate spelling when you are writing your code as wrong spelling may result in errors in your code.
You cannot write your code wherever you like as writing your code in different places can have different outcomes.
Indentation can be used to make code easier to read and relate codes together. Indentation will not affect the way your code appears when you run the project.
Visual studio will automatically add colour to certain aspects of code to help the readability of code.
Code is defined inside a code block. You define a code block by inserting 'sub' or 'function' followed by 'end sub' or 'end function'. Alternatively, you can type 'module' followed by 'end module'. Your code should appear between these.
It is important to place your message within double quotation marks in your codeLesson SummaryProject templates provide a great starting point for different types of applications that you want to build.
The solution explorer is an important feature of visual studio as it is the main navigational device to the other files and settings that comprise a program.
By default, visual studio saves projects in the current user's documents folder on their computer.
Visual studio is the preferred way to open an .sin file.Lesson SummaryStatements in visual basic are like thoughts or complete sentences. Statements are made up of one or more expressions and in turn an expression is made up of operators and operands.
An operand is similar to a noun in a sentence such as a variable. Operators are like verbs and will act on the noun.
You can pause and watch the execution of each line of code by setting a stop sign or break point in your code. This allows you to execute your code and when you get to that break point, you can continue to step through the code line by line or continue on to execute the rest of the lines of code.
An array is a grouping or a collection of data.
Creating methods help us to better organise our code and eliminates duplicating code.
Camel casing can be used to distinguish when one word begins, and another ends.
Lesson SummaryThe string data type can hold a lot of information, therefore working with strings is a vital skill in visual basic.
You can figure out how to manipulate the string to make it exactly the way you want using the built-in functions in visual studio.
It is recommended that you should always use the correct visual basic verbiage rather than relying on the visual basic shortcuts to prevent problems from occurring.
Time and Dates can be presented using the built-in code in ViLesson SummaryThe codes that you write in your methods are ultimately defining the classes of your application. Every method that you use from the .NET framework class library is just a class and that's why it's part of the class library.
Every time you create a new instance of a class, you have a new object that is distinct and separate from the other instances of that class. It lives on its own.
You can create many instances of a single class by giving each instance of a class a different identifier, so it is distinct from every other item based on the same class in the computer's memory.
The .NET framework run-time keeps the memory region clear and gets rid of stuff it no longer needs. It does this by counting references or counting how many handles you are actually holding on to.
You can create a variable that can hold a reference but you don't have to create a new reference necessarily, you can just copy the reference from another object. Once variables go out of scope then those variable's values are no longer accessible.
There are a number of methods in the .NET framework class library that you don't have access to because they are hidden behind the private accessibility modifiersual Basics, alternatively, you can customize your own.Lesson SummaryThe framework class library is so large that its developers split it up into multiple files. These library code files are called assemblies.
All the classes and methods are split up into different assemblies. When you create your own projects, you are creating the basis for a dot net assembly as well.
There are two kinds of assembly, an executable assembly and a library assembly.
MyNamespace is great for getting information about the current computer that you are running on, working with files and folders on the computer, working with command line arguments into your command window application, and working with configuration files.
In larger projects, you might want to keep multiple projects into the same solution when there are somewhat related.
Reference counting refers to how many references are still attached to a given object.
The dot net framework will count the references, if the count is zero then it will remove that object from memory.
Whenever you declare a variable inside of a block of code, that variable is only alive and accessible from the life of that block of code. This means that whenever that code has finished executing, the variable defined inside of that block of code is no longer accessible, its values are disposed of by the dot net framework run time.Lesson SummaryGeneric collections are called so because you have to define the type for the collection to make it specific.
When we create a new item in our dictionary, we must give it a key and a value. A key is similar to a word in a normal English dictionary while a value is similar to a description of a word in an English dictionary.
You can index into the dictionary by supplying the key to get a specific instance of the entire object.
Using multiple curly braces can be confusing. But you can select a curly brace and whichever curly brace you have selected, visual studio will show its corresponding beginning or ending brace by highlighting the brace in grey.
By using the And keyword, you're able to add additional filtering criteria in a link query.
Enumeration is a data type that limits and constraints all possible values to only those that are valid for an application.Lesson SummaryCompilation errors can be fixed before a user releases the application to others.
You should always code defensively through the try catch end try statements in visual basics.
When you release an application to the end user, ensure you are accounting for all the potential problems that may arise.
You should strive to examine every part of your application that relies on some exterior resource that is not directly in your control as a developer. You should then apply the Try Catch Finally' judiciously in those parts of your application that you cannot control.
Event-driven programming is at the heart of most of Microsoft presentation API's whether you are building web or windows applications.
Events allow you, as a developer, to plug in and respond by handling key moments or events in the life cycle of an application's execution.
An object will declare an event, the developer can then attach code or add handlers to the various events that are raised by objects and write any custom code in response to them events.
We can take control of adding or removing event handlers to specific events by using the add handler and remove handler keywords and pointing them to the address of methods that we implement in our source code.Learning OutcomesBy the end of this module, you will be able to:Describe the working principle of Infrared control.Summarise the hardware and the software required for this project.Outline the steps for downloading and installing Arduino IDE and Proteus software.Identify the IR sensor, RGB LED, and other needed components.Explain the procedure of designing the circuit schematic for IR control with a microcontroller.Discuss the coding and the testing process for IR control.Indicate the ways to create a simple electronic circuit for IR control without a microcontroller.

Lesson Summary 1 Course assessment Lesson SummaryA relay is a simple electrically operated control switch that is made up of an electromagnet and one or more sets of contacts. It is commonly used to control the high current circuit path by using a low control voltage.Fixed and movable contacts are important components of an electromagnetic relay. The contacts of the relay are used to break one electrical connection and make another electrical connection when the relay is energized.
Contactors are used in the control schematics of electrical systems. The contactor has power contacts as well as auxiliary contacts for required operations.The Auxiliary relay used in the control circuit once energised changes its contacts position (i.e) from NO to NC and from NC to NO. When the relay is de-energized, it gets reset in different ways. Auxiliary Relays are used for control, monitoring and multiplication etc., along with switching logic. A monitoring relay is a device that is used to receive input signals, monitor and determine them, and sends an alarm signal if a threshold value is attained.Timer helps in controlling a sequence of operations in a system. There are different types of timers based on the principle of operation; Examples: electro-magnetic timers, pneumatic timers, static timers etc.Relays used in electrical systems require some additional arrangements to operate efficiently. Most of the monitoring relays are latch-in relays or electrical reset relays.The control voltage of the relay is classified into pick-up voltage and drop-off voltage based on the operation performed by the relay. In general, the pickup value should not be less than 75% and the drop out value should not be more than 15% to 20% of the rated voltage.Under voltage relays and over-voltage relays are used to monitor the voltage of a bus, a line, generator etc., If the voltage exceeds or lowers the preset value in the monitoring system, these relays will pick up or drop out accordingly. Thus, these relays play a vital role in protecting a system or a devicLesson SummaryA circuit breaker is an electrical switch designed to connect or disconnect an electrical installation from the Source Power/Voltage.The closing and tripping command has to be given to the circuit breaker when needed. The control circuit provides the sequence of operations that have to be performed for closing or tripping the circuit breaker.
A circuit breaker is an electrical switch that controls an electrical circuit containing loads. With the help of commands from the protective devices of the load or the supply system, it helps to isolate the load circuit from the supply system at the shortest possible time. 
In general, a control circuit helps to perform ON/OFF operations and to protect the electrical system during fault conditions.
Troubleshooting is needed to improve and maintain complex systems. Malfunctioning of a system has to be identified first for troubleshooting.
The tripping control circuit is an important part of the normal opening/tripping of a circuit breaker. It helps to open the circuit when needed and to protect the controlled equipment as well as the electrical system during various fault conditions. 
A circuit breaker is an electrical switch that is used to make and break electrical connections. The tripping circuit scheme operates with help of command signals from operating personal and also from the protective devices of the load or the supply system. 
All breakers have closing and tripping circuits for their operation. The trip circuit helps in protecting the system under service from faults by tripping the breaker. Thus it plays a vital protective operation.
The trip circuit must be healthy at all times for its effective operation. Thus to monitor the trip circuit's healthiness, trip circuit supervision is done. Critical Facility: Power Supply Management Module 1 Module 1: Overview of Critical Operations 1. Learning Outcomes 1 2. Facilities Operation Management and Critical Operations 11 3. Critical Industries 15 4. Lesson Summary 2 Module 2 Module 2: Power and Power Sources Module 3 Module 3: Power Distribution Course assessment What are Critical Operations?Critical Operations are just that—actions, processes, and systems that enable the execution of the integral functions of a business or organization. Simply put, the litmus test to identify Critical Operations can be: if this "thing"—a specific task, process, or system—broke or stopped working, would this hinder or cripple the continued ability of the organization to meet its goals?
Critical Operations are classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics. For instance, the emergency generator at an air traffic control tower is absolutely mission critical, whereas a backup generator for your local sporting goods store is not. The consequences of the same component failing are vastly different: the loss of the former during a power outage poses a tremendous, imminent threat to the safe landing of airplanes, but the loss of the latter during a power outage will probably only result in the store closing early and losing some sales. The two are simply not comparable in the severity of their impact.
There are some systems and processes that are fairly unique to Critical Operations because they create reliability and safety for the systems and processes crucial to the success of the larger entity. Regardless of how commonplace or unique the component may be, Critical Operations are united by the fact they are the fundamental building blocks that allow an organization to deliver a service with little or no possibility for error, downtime, or any other type of interruption. Additional Resources Fig, 1.2 Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or service.
Non-physical items such as specific procedures or safety programs might be considered characteristics of the critical infrastructure of critical operations, but in this sense, critical infrastructure focuses on the physical pieces of equipment that make up the critical operations system, including systems networks. A threat is anything that can potentially cause damage or harm to a person or object. A threat can be environmental in nature, the result of faulty equipment, or human-created in the form of accidents, negligence, or nefarious activities. Considering the possible threats posed to the people, property, or systems within a critical facility is an important part of both the design and implementation of critical operations. Within reason, you should always assess the potential threats to critical operations and plan for as many as is practical. This is equally important in design, construction, and day-to-day sustained operations within a facility.
In a critical facility, there is almost never a single piece of equipment—or even one, stand-alone system—that constitutes the whole of the facility’s critical operations. Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of a system as a set of interconnected "things" or components that come together to form a more complex whole. A fundamental building block of critical operations is simply understanding that these components, in any combination, come together to create a more complicated system that serves a mission critical purpose. 
Within a facility, these various systems work together to perform critical functions and are often connected to each other, via design and/or their operators, by various systems of process and procedure. More often than not, the critical operations within a critical facility include the following systems.
Click on the following tabs to explore some examples of critical systems:PowerHeating, Ventilation, and Air ConditioningPlumbing and other Mechanical SystemsSafety and SecurityControlsCritical power systems cover an immense spectrum of designs and components, but really only fulfill two purposes: delivering power to equipment performing critical tasks or distribute power from generation sources. There are five key elements of Critical Operations that tie together the various systems that make up the mission critical environment. These elements include: Networking and ITSecurityPolicies and proceduresDocumentationCrisis management Networking and ITNetworking refers to the system of computers and other assorted hardware and software components that are connected together to allow for the communication of data and information between devices. 
It is part of a broader category of Information Technology (IT), which is the broad application of computer devices and other communications equipment that are used to deliver, receive, and store data or other types of information.  Fig 1.3 Case Study 2: IT FailuresYou can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see ResourceCase Study 1: Critical Operation Failures You can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see ResourceSecurity Security refers to the application of devices and procedures to ensure that a valuable asset—whether an object, a person, a facility, or even information—is protected from harm. For Critical Operations, security can be grouped into three main areas of focus: protecting people (safety), protecting equipment (physical design), and protecting information (processes and procedures). Case Study 3: Security BreachesYou can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see ReProcedures and PoliciesProcedures are specifically prescribed means for accomplishing tasks in a reliable and safe manner. Policies are guidelines that direct actions or activities, generally needed to ensure similar outcomes are achieved given a wide array of possible inputs and variables. 
Another way to think of the distinction is that policies govern our thoughts and the boundaries for related actions, while procedures are designed to specific sets or sequences of actions required to assure a predicted result.  Case Study 4: Failing to Adhere to Procedures or Policies You can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see ResourcDocumentationDocumentation is a collection of documents that are relevant to a specific topic, whether that is an object, process, or any other specific subject. Documentation often includes user manuals, procedure checklists, reference guides, and so forth, and can be in hard copy (or paper) or electronic form.
 
In a perfect world, documentation should exist—and be easily accessible—for every component of the critical system and for every possible process, policy, or procedure. This includes documents about the system design, installation, and operation specifications, instructions, and material history for all of the various components of the system and facility.  Fig. 1.4 Case Study 5: Improper Documentation You can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see Resourcees)CrisesA crisis is any event or occurrence, typically happening abruptly or with little or no warning, that has the potential to result in an unstable or dangerous environment. 
Crises can take on many forms and require specific responses, depending upon their nature. A natural disaster and the threat of imminent system failure are of equal concern. For the sake of identification and planning, it is important to categorize the different types of crises and how to address them. A threat is any natural or man-made occurrence, individual, entity, or action that has or indicates the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.An incident is any occurrence, caused by either human action or natural phenomena, that may cause harm and that may require action. 
An attack is any malicious activity by outside individuals directed at a specific target. Crisis ManagementOf all the in-depth planning and design that goes into bringing a critical installation online, and as skilled as its operators may be, emergency situations still arise—it's inevitable. Hence, the necessity for crisis management: the planning and monitoring for and the immediate response to any potential threat.
It is vital to have well-thought-out crisis management plans that operations teams are trained on and comfortable with. Writing scripts for every possible scenario is highly impractical, if not impossible, but consistent plans to respond to situations, to establish a path towards stability, and to connect the right resources will be invaluable in the event of a crisis. Accelerated Decision Time Frame  With incidents occurring in real time, quick decisions provide windows of opportunity to stop an event or at least mitigate damages from spiraling out of control. Crisis management leaders must think on their feet and be confident enough in prior planning efforts to execute response activities so that they lose as little time as possible. Phases of Crisis ManagementIn the event of a crisis, there are three phases of crisis management that are typically followed: Crisis Assessment - The right problem needs to be addressed and it needs to be fixed. Plans and procedures should be followed to determine things like: How did this begin? Are there other conditions (e.g., alarms, faults, etc.) that we're not seeing? What resources are available? And, what is the status of all our systems? Crisis Action Plan - With answers to the preceding questions, the crisis management leader should begin to enact and/or develop action plans. This spans the range from completing triage activities, to incident notification protocols, to marshaling resources for permanent repairs, to establishing the level of sensitivity or urgency under which these actions are to take place. Depending upon the environment, formal crisis response activities may continue on until every single fault or failure is addressed, whereas other facilities simply want to restore operations, even under temporary conditions, and document the go-forward plan. Crisis Termination - Again, putting a stop to the crisis response varies by industry and application, but generally falls into the two approaches just mentioned: maintain the crisis response posture until all systems, equipment, and operations are fully restored or repaired, or release this posture once the threat to operational availability has been neutralized and the crisis leadership is comfortable with the documented remediation plansritical IndustriesAs a Facilities Operator, it is imperative that you know all of the organizations that are part of the critical infrastructure, especially those that are inherently interconnected.  According to U.S. national policy created to "strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure," there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors. 

Use this policy as a guideline to understand critical infrastructure in whatever nation you may reside in:Chemical SectorCommerical Facilities SectorCommunications SctorCritical Manufacturing SectorDams SectorDefense Industrial Base SectorEmergency Services SectorEnergy SectorFinancial Services SectorFood and Agriculture SectorGovernment Facilities SectorHealthcare and Public Health SectorInformation Technology SectorNuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste SectorChemical Sector The Chemical Sector consists of five segments based largely on what final products they produce, each of which has unique characteristics, markets, development opportunities and, accordingly, respective areas of issue. These five segments are: Basic chemicalsSpeciality chemicalsAgricultural chemicalsPharmaceuticalsCommercial Facilities SectorThe Commercial Facilities Sector consists of any facility that operates within the sphere of open public access, which means that the general public can easily enter and move about in the facility's space without the presence of security barriers. Typically, these facilities require unfettered access to the general public because they provide a commercial service or product to them. They fall into one of eight subsectors: Public Assembly (such as arenas, stadiums, zoos/aquariums, museums, convention centers, etc.) 
Sports Leagues (such as professional sports leagues or other organizations)
Gaming (such as casinos) 
Lodging (such as hotels, motels, conference centers, etc.) 
Outdoor Events (such as amusement parks, fairs, campgrounds, parades, etc.) 
Entertainment and Media (such as movie theaters, movie studios, broadcast media centers, etc.) 
Real Estate (such as office buildings, apartment buildings, condominiums, mixed-use facilities, storage facilities, etc.) 
Retail (such as retail centers or districts, shopping malls, etc.)Communications SectorThe Communications Sector is an integral part of the entire critical infrastructure of a nation, since so many other sectors rely heavily upon it. This sector, in particular, has changed significantly over the past two or three decades, as communications technology has quickly evolved: where it used to be primarily concerned with voice services, it now includes terrestrial, satellite, and wireless transmission systems. And, more so, these various transmission types have become interconnected, working together to provide seamless, end-to-end transmissions across different communication media. 

Today, many providers will share their facilities and technologies to ensure that there is interoperability among the different transmission mediums. Fig. 1.5  - A cell tower is a critical component of wireless transmission systems, one of the most common communications mConsumer products
Transportation Systems Sector
Water and Wastewater Systems SectorCritical Manufacturing SectorThe Critical Manufacturing Sector is another sector that can be considered crucial to the continued, uninterrupted functioning of some of the other critical infrastructure sectors because the products that they manufacture are directly used—if not essential to—the operations of the others. 
This sector consists of four broad categories of industries that manufacture critical components: Primary Metal Manufacturing—including iron, steel, and ferro alloy manufacturing, alumina/ aluminum production and processing, and nonferrous metal production and processing. 
Machinery Manufacturing—including engine, turbine, and power transmission equipment manufacturing. 
Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing—including electrical equipment manufacturing. 
Transportation Equipment Manufacturing—including vehicle manufacturing, aviation and aerospace product and parts manufacturing, and railroad rolling stock ams Sector FIg. 1.7 The Dams Sector is another critical component of a nation's critical infrastructure. The Dams Sector consists of a number of different types of dam-related assets, including dams, locks, levees and dikes, hurricane barriers, hydropower generation facilities, and a host of other water containment or control facilities. The facilities or organizations that fall within the Dams Sector provide services with a wide range of benefits, including water supply and waste management, flood control, waterway navigation, natural wildlife habitats, and even recreation. These services also extend to some of the other critical infrastructure sectors—such as providing a source of water for the Food and Agriculture Sector—creating strong interdependencies between the Dams Sector and these other sectorefense Industrial Base SectorThe Defense Industrial Base Sector is a complex collection of industries that supports the research and development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons, parts, and other components for a nation's military, including products and services that are necessary for mobilizing, deploying, and maintaining military operations.Financial Services SectorThe Financial Services Sector consists of the wide variety of institutions that provide financial products and services to individual consumers, businesses, and the other critical infrastructure sectors. These activities include depositing funds, making payments between parties, providing credit to consumers, investing funds, and transferring financial risk between parties. 
As technology has become more prevalent in the financial industries, this sector has become more vulnerable to newer security risks including power emergencies, the effects of natural disasters on IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity threats.Emergency Services Sector The Emergency Services Sector (ESS) serves as a nation's primary defense in regard to the prevention of and remediation of risk resulting from both man-made and natural incidences. In addition to protecting an entire nation in the event of an emergency, it also carries the heavy burden of serving as the first line of defense for the remaining critical infrastructure sectors. 
This includes a wide array of response functions in an emergency, but primarily it is responsible for protecting people, property, and the environment; providing assistance to those affected by the emergency event; and providing recovery services and aid to those impacted by the event. 
These emergency response actions are the responsibility of five broad categories of emergency responders: Law enforcementPublic worksFire and emergency servicesEmergency medical servicesEmergency management servicesWithin the ESS, there are also a number of specialized organizations that provide specific services in the event of an emergency of various types, including: Public Safety Answering Points (such as emergency telephone call center responders)Tactical Operations (such as S.W.A.T or Emergency Response Units)Search and RescueAviation Services (such as police or medical helicopters)Hazardous MaterialsEnergy SectorThe Energy Sector has been labeled "uniquely critical" by DHS because the products and services it provides directly support the critical functioning of the other critical infrastructure sectors. The sector is divided into three interconnected segments, including:Electricity (which is produced by combusting coal, combusting natural gas, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric plants, or renewable power sources) 
Petroleum 
Natural Gas 
Almost every critical sector relies on some form of energy produced by the Energy Sector industries, making it both incredibly important but also incredibly vulnerable to threats. Food and Agriculture SectorThe Food and Agriculture Sector consists of those industries producing and providing food-related products or services to the nation, including:FarmsRestuarantsGovernment Facilities SectorThe Government Facilities Sector consists of a number of government-owned and operated buildings, some of which are publicly accessible and some that are open to approved personnel only. Those that are open to the public include buildings used for business, commercial, or even recreational purposes; those that are not open to the public typically house sensitive information or materials, including government-used office buildings, courthouses, embassies, laboratories, or any other structure that might be home to critical equipment or systems. 
The Government Facilities Sector is also responsible for utilizing cyber technology to protect government assets, including information and personnel, that are critical to government functions. Healthcare and Public Health SectorThe Healthcare and Public Health Sector is responsible for protecting the public from all sorts of risks to their health, including terrorism, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and other natural disasters. These responsibilities are both proactive, in the form of providing preventative healthcare options; and reactive, in the form of providing healthcare response and recovery actions in an emergency event. 
The healthcare component of these services is typically delivered and managed at the local level via private industries or state-run programs, while the public health component is typically managed across all government levels.Manufacturing, processing, and storage facilitiesExplosive Ordinance Disposal (such as a bomb squad)The main points from this module are as follows:A Critical Operation is classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics.Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or services.Critical Infrastructure sectors include:Chemical Sector Commercial Facilities Sector

Identify utility-based sources of power. 
Identify types of generator-provided power. 
Identify types of uninterruptible power supplies. 
Identify types of battery systems.
Identify alternative sources of power. s Sector Power FundamentalsWhen you think of the term "power," you may think first of the utility lines that provide us with the energy needed to keep the lights and your electronic devices powered on and working. And, as you know, power is one of the utilities necessary for keeping Critical Operations up and running. But what you may not know are the fundamental concepts of power: what power is and how it works.  ElectricityElectricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles. The electricity that is most relevant to the discussion of power and power sources is the latter, known as current electricity since it flows between objects or places. A good analogy for this kind of electricity is water in a hose: when the water is turned on, pressure is applied to the water at one end of the hose and pushes it out the other end. Electricity works similarly: electrically charged particles flow from one end—say, a power generator—and come out on the other end—perhaps the lights in your house.
But electricity is also a concept that encompasses all aspects about the accumulation or flow of electric charge, from the quality and volume of energy transferred to the manner in which it reacts with different components. The best way to learn about electricity is from the bottom up: beginning with the characteristics of the flowing electrons (speed & volume); the different means of measuring electric charge; and some of the most common components, or building blocks, or electrical systems.Critical Systems That Rely on Constant Availability of PowerThere are very few purely mechanical systems in use today that do not require some sort of electrical power. It is, therefore, possible to state that all critical systems in Critical Operations rely upon electrical power. The degree, however, to which equipment needs constant availability of power, or a certain quality of power is a differentiating factor. 
Some systems are energy hogs but are not highly sensitive to ebbs and flows in the power supply, while some other systems use only a small amount of electricity but have little or no tolerance for any fluctuation in the quality of power supplied.  One example of a critical system that relies on the constant availability of power would be a computer-based system, like a data center, in which the components are highly sensitive to a constant supply of electricity at a specific voltage. The concern here is that any interruption, no matter how momentary, can cause a hiccup in the function of a delicate high-speed motor component, which would then cause ripple effects throughout other Critical Operations. Loss of data or continuity of data are both a great concern for all the electronic and digitally controlled systems in place today. The other form of Critical Operation electrical systems particularly concerned with the constant availability of power are those with complex or extended start-up cycle times. 
Plenty of Critical Operations have sufficient tolerance or backup plans to handle a system going offline for a few seconds or a minute; for instance, an emergency communications/command center could temporarily allow data to be routed elsewhere and rely upon the most recent information or view information from another location to continue making decisions and move operations forward. 
But, bringing all of these systems back online, in the proper sequence and with the proper security considerations in place, might actually take hours or days to complete. In this case, those two seconds of power drop begin to cripple Critical Operations for an extended period of time. Fig 2.1 Case Study 6: Power Loss and PreparationYou can read the above case study in the Case Study in the Critical Facility Management pdf (see ResourceVoltageVoltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them. VoltsA volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity.  Fig 2.2 Think of it this way: conceptually, it is like both the speed limit of a roadway and the actual speed of the cars traveling on that roadway. The speed limit on Interstate 5 is 70 mph whether or not there are vehicles on the road going 70 mph; in the same manner, a 12V flashlight is still a 12V flashlight whether it is turned on or off. Systems are designed to operate at specific voltages, but are not always restricted to that voltage. However, that specific voltage needs to be supplied as consistently as possible to allow the system to operate properly but not running too far outside of optimal operations and potentially causing damage; in the roadway example, this would be establishing a speed limit that allows for the efficient travel of all the commuters on the road, but prevents dangerous speeds that potentially result in loss of control, accidents, or wrecks.Low VoltageLow voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels. There are actually many technical definitions of what constitutes a low voltage system that vary by industry and country; for example, in the US, a low voltage system is one operating at 100V or less. 
Some examples of common low voltage systems are included in the following tabs:Control CircuitsVoice CircuitsNetwork/Data CircuitsWiring circuits for building and equipment controls systems run at a multitude of voltages and tend to vary most with the age of the system or facility. In newer installations (within the last decade or two), you will most frequently run across 24V controls systems. Voltage is dictated by the types of components and controllers on the circuits, but the trend is moving towards standardization to increase the commonality of repair parts (wiring harnesses, power modules, backup batteries, etc.). 
You may also see or hear controls circuits referred to as signal wiring, particularly in international settings. Medium Voltage  Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
Operators working in Critical Operations should be most concerned about the medium voltage systems in their day-to-day tasks, primarily due to the various levels of specified protective equipment and safety regulations required to operate and maintain the power components within a medium voltage system. In this case, dedicated safety and technical training is required, but stops short of needing a full electrical license or advanced preparations.

The following tabs includes some examples of common voltages falling within the medium voltage range and their common applications:110/120V• Wall outlets
• Corded tools/equipment (i.e., window fans)220/240V277VHigh Voltage Fig 2.3 Especially in the Critical Operations industry, high voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers. Some large-scale manufacturing or power generation systems may have high voltage components inside the facility, downstream of the utility supply and backup power systems, but they will be highly specialized to the location Live high voltage circuits are incredibly dangerous to work around since there is no protective gear in existence that can protect an operator from the hazards associated with an electrical fault. Operators and technicians rarely perform maintenance on these systems as it is left to utility electricians or specialty contractors due to the infrequency of operation and the levels of knowledge required to do so safely. However, protective gear should be worn even when operating breakers and switches at these voltages with the housings fully closed.

CurrentElectrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire. Current takes into account both the volume of electrons in the circuit and the speed in which they are moving, which is the circuit's voltage. AmperesAmperes, represented by the shortened term amps or the letter A, is the unit of measure for expressing the flow rate of an electric charge, or current. Scientifically speaking, one ampere is equal to the current flowing in two parallel wires, one meter apart, producing a force of 2x10-7 newtons per meter. Current, expressed in amps, is measured by using an instrument called an ammeter.  PowerPower measures the work done (or the potential work that can be done) by electricity. Specifically, power is the rate at which a given amount of energy is transferred through an electrical circuit. The power of a system can be calculated using the simplified equation, power = voltage x current. Power FactorIn a real, operating electrical system, there are many components that are influenced by their environment that create inefficiencies. So how do you bridge the gap between ideal physics and real-world function?
By using the power factor, a concept generally calculated indirectly as the ratio of real power (the amount of energy actually available or used) to apparent power (the potential power purely available in an ideal system with no losses). A power factor of 1.0 in a system is referred to as a "unity" and represents perfect conditionDirect Current versus Alternating CurrentDirect CurrentAlternating CurrentIllustration of a Direct CurrentIllustration of a Alternating Current Direct current (DC) is a constant flow of electricity that travels in one direction. It is the "original" type of electrical power, or that which is produced by batteries. In a DC system, both voltage and current are constant, and there is another variable at play: resistance, which is the innate property of most conductors that creates opposition to the passage of an electrical current. Resistance is measured in ohms, represented by the symbol Ω, named after the German physicist who discovered this property.Single-Phase Power versus Three-Phase PowerSingle-Phase PowerThree-Phase PowerSingle-phase power is a specific type of AC power distribution where a single conductor carries one waveform of current, or multiple conductors carry multiple currents with matching waveforms. A single-phase AC power supply does not create a magnetic field in the motor it is connected to, and therefore needs additional circuits to start the motor. 
For this reason, single-phase power is the most common power distribution scheme for residential and light duty commercial environments, which use few large motors or no motors at all. 
Changing and Converting VoltageTransformersRectifiers and InvertersA transformer is an electrical device that changes voltage in an AC circuit—either increasing it or decreasing it—by varying the current flowing through the conductor's internal wires using a process called electromagnetic induction. Basically, it manipulates the characteristics of the rotating electromagnetic fields that create AC power in the first place, in order to “step up” or “step down” the AC voltage supplied. Most commonly, transformers are used to reduce the voltage as it works its way down through the electrical distribution system from highUnits of MeasurementWatts and KilowattsA watt is the global standard for measuring electrical power and has a value of one joule per second. One watt is not a tremendous amount of energy, so you may often encounter the measurement of a kilowatt—or 1,000 watts.Kilowatt Hours

For this, generator-provided power is the most common source of backup energy. But, of course, there are many types of backup generators and fuels that can be used to power them, and different types of system components to safely switch between the two sources of power. 
As a facilities operator, it will be vitally important for you to have a strong working knowledge of generator-provided power and how to integrate this source of backup power into your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the different types of generator-provided power and the system components used to implement them safThere are different types of generators that are rated for use in certain situations, based on their size and function. The intended use within Critical Operationss typically guides which type of generator is the best fit for a system. 
Click on the following tabs to learn about the various types of generator-sets:Stand-By ContinuousPrime PowerStand-by generator sets are exactly as the name implies: purely backup systems. These engines are off, in a normal state, but fully operational and waiting on a start command to fire up and power Critical Operations.  Stand-by generators may be required to operate for extended periods of time in large emergencies, but ideally only need to run for a few hours during a utility outage. Typically, a stand-by generator will have some more rugged components installed, such as heavy-duty starters and starting batteries, pre-lubrication pumps, and jacket water heaters, so as to be able to start immediately during any condition.Fuel TypesTraditionally, the prime mover for a generator set is an internal combustion engine. An internal combustion engine can run on a variety of fuel types, with diesel, fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas being the most common engine fuels in use. 
However, there are some pros and cons to evaluate when considering what type of engine/fuel type is best for Critical Operations. Click on the following tabs to explore:DieselFuel OilGasolineNatural GasThe term "diesel fuel" is the commonly accepted shorthand for off-road diesel #2, a particular type of petroleum-based fuel that is not the same as the “highway use” diesel you might fill up your truck with. Diesel #2 is a particular grade of refinement that would not meet the emissions requirements for use on roadways in most states. It is also usually colored with a red dye to denote its off-road use. Utilizes the heat and pressure created by compression as its means of starting.  
Pros:
•      Most common and reliable engine type, and is therefore widely available. 

Cons:
• Larger minimum engine size. 
• Concerns regarding emissions. 
• Potential issues with cold-starts. Automatic Transfer Switches An automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a particularly helpful component that acts as an independent traffic director of sorts, to ensure that power is being supplied from the most optimal source available. While ATSs exist in many places throughout Critical Operations installations, ATSs at the main utility input are of unique importance since they perform a few extra duties. 
Think of an ATS as a “Y” gate, with the top of the Y connecting to two different power sources; in this case, the utility-source and the generator. The bottom of the Y heads off to whatever load is being supported. The ATS has two main parts: a control panel and the switch. The control panel is always monitoring power quality signals from both sources and is programmed to have a primary and alternate source.  Throw-Over SwitchesA throw-over switch, or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but without the automatic control features. Some switches still have control panels that will provide an alert or alarm when conditions reach set thresholds, although they will require an operator to physically make the transfer.Paralleling SwitchgearParalleling switchgear are large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout the system. Specifically, they are used to switch the power source for the load, provide load sharing capabilities, operate the generator, meter the output, and protect the generator from any potential malfunctions. Uninterruptible Power Supplies By now, you have a strong understanding of the two main types of power that can be provided to your Critical Operations: the consistent power supplied from the utility-source and the backup power supplied from a generator. These are likely the two sources you are most familiar with, just from day-to-day use; you may have even used a generator before to supply power to your own home. But, there is another source of backup power that is a commonly-used, critical component of any Critical Operation: an uninterruptible power supply. 
As a facilities operator, it is imperative that you understand the purpose of an uninterruptible power supply and be able to choose between the different types that are available in order to best serve your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the types of uninterruptible power supplieUPSAn uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device or machine that provides immediate emergency power when the primary power source fails, using electrical energy stored within the device itself. UPSs are a critical component of a Critical Operations power system because they are designed to provide clean and continuous power to Critical Operations during power interruptions and eliminate abnormal fluctuations from the power source as delivered.Electricity delivered from the utility power source is never “clean power,” often experiencing spikes, sags, and occasional interruptions. These power abnormalities can wreak havoc on the IT load and other critical equipment serving Critical Operations and even severely damage them. UPSs protect these systems by providing temporary backup power for brief outages and absorbing those spikes and sags, ensuring the power delivered is within acceptable tolerances and specification for critical consumption. UPSs are not designed to sustain power supply for long periods of time, but rather long enough to engage another alternative source of power, such as a power generator, to accept the electrical load. UPSs vary in design and method of application, but the basic function of a UPS follows the same principle. A UPS accepts AC power from the provided source, stores a portion of the energy in a backup battery system, and delivers the remaining to the critical connected equipment. In order to perform this vital function, the UPS requires three key components: a charger/rectifier, a battery or other storage mechanism (typically, a flywheel), and an inverter. The charger/rectifier converts the input AC power to DC power for battery charging, and the inverter converts the battery power to AC power during a power interruption.FlywheelsAs an alternative to a battery system, flywheels can be used with a UPS to support continuous power requirements. A flywheel is a mechanical-type storage device that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis. The electrical input spins the flywheel rotor up to speed where it remains fully charged in stand-by mode, 24/7, until a power interruption requires its activation. When this occurs, the flywheel provides back-up power immediately, while the system monitors for proper electrical input. If this condition persists for a specified time frame measured in seconds, the system transfers to a more permanent power source such as the backup generator system. 
This technology is relatively cost-effective and environmentally friendly as opposed to the traditional lead acid battery system. Although the initial cost of batteries is relatively low, the cost of maintaining, replacing, and disposing of batteries over the long term must be taken into consideration. Flywheel technology can also work alongside a battery system if desired, and is highly effective at absorbing the abnormal electrical inputs as the first line of defense, thus prolonging the life of the storage batteries.Line Interactive UPSA line interactive UPS combines the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit. 
This system limits transient voltages when switching and increases the speed of the changeover from main power to backup battery power. Because of this design, a line inverter UPS does not have to resort to batteries as often as other systems; instead, it utilizes some of its battery power only to support the transition from normal mode to voltage regulation mode. Load Bus Synchronization Load Bus Synchronization (LBS) is an engineering method to keep the output of two independent UPSs in sync, even if they are operating from two different sources of supplied power. In general, a UPS in a multiple-UPS system will automatically sync to its own bypass source, as long as all of the UPSs are tied to the same input source. However, imagine if these UPSs were operating off of different back-up generators, batteries, or another bypass source. In these scenarios, their outputs will always tend to drift out of sync and cause problems within the electrical load. 
The LBS system functions by continuously monitoring the sync reference signals of two UPS modules. It remains in a dormant state until the output of the UPS modules drift out of predetermined operational parameters—or out of sync—at which point the LBS activates and manipulates the output of each UPS module until they once again fall in sync with each other. Once completed, the LBS once again returns to its dormant state of operatiBatteriesSo far, the sources of power you have learned about are typically used on a larger scale, providing power to a whole system or the large components within it. When it comes to providing power to smaller devices or equipment (or, sometimes, even a secondary source of power), batteries are a familiar and typical solution; however, not all batteries are best suited for use in a Critical Operation environment. 
As a facilities operator, you will need to be able to differentiate between the different types of batteries and select the one that is best for your particular Critical Operation’s needs.  Lead Acid BatteriesLead acid batteries are widely prevalent and come in many options available for commercial/ industrial scale usage in MCOs. In a lead acid battery, the positive terminal is made of lead-oxide (PbO2), the negative terminal is made of lead (Pb), and the electrolyte solution that fills the container is some concentration of sulfuric-acid (H2SO4). The chemical reaction amongst the three components produces the voltage for the battery. 
Flooded wet cell batteries are the original form of lead acid batteries and simply have the cathode and anode fully submerged in the electrolyte solution. The top of the battery is covered, with the terminals protruding for connection, and two ports: a vent and a fill port. As part of the chemical reaction releasing and storing energy in the battery, the acid (in this case, H2SO4) and some water (H2O) molecules are broken apart, releasing hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gasses. This gas needs to be vented in order to prevent over-pressurization of the battery, hence the need for the vent. Some of the solution can also evaporate over time, so to maintain the cathode and anode fully submerged, de-ionized water may need to be added to the jar from time to time. 
Valve Regulated Lead Acid batteries (VRLA) are an advancement of lead-acid battery technology and have been in wide use for decades now. This battery design utilizes a specialized one-way pressure release valve, only releasing gasses when pressure is actually beginning to rise to certain levels (whereas the flooded wet cell tends to release most all gas produced). By forcing the gasses to stay within the jar, they become re-absorbed by the solution, attach to the cathode and/or anode, and through ionic exchange reactions, form water again. This is a process commonly referred to as recombinant technology and delivers two main benefits: increased safety protection from over-pressurization and/or dangerous gas release, as well as virtually eliminating the need to ever refill a jar.Utility-Source Power The next important concept to discuss, once you understand the fundamentals of power, is where power comes from. There are a myriad of energy sources in use today, and that list keeps growing as old sources fall out of fashion and new sources are discovered or developed. Of these sources, utility-source power is one of the most common sources of energy and the one you are probably most familiar with since you see it and use it on a daily basis. 
As a facilities operation professional, you will need to know where your power comes from and understand the nuances of how and how much power comes into your Critical Operations facility from the source. In this topic, you will identify utility-based sources of power.he following tabs to explore the most common sources that provide utility power:CoalCoal-fueled power generation plants supply about half the electricity in the United States. Coal is the original fossil fuel and receives the most press regarding the environmental impact of its use. It is formed over long periods of time as geological processes build up over layers of biological material—mostly plants. Coal is extracted from the earth via mining. 
The basic concept for creating power from coal is common to most electricity generation plants: create a heat source to turn water into pressurized steam which may then transmit mechanical energy to a turbine. The rotation of the turbine may directly, or indirectly, spin the rotor of a generator set. Natural GasNuclear
Hydroelectric
SolarWindHigh vs. Medium Voltage Systems Fig. 2.11 When discussing utility supply power levels, there is some difficulty in clearly quantifying power levels, particularly the upper and lower boundaries for medium voltage systems. For the purposes of grid connections, let's just consider the utility supply lines at the point where Critical Operations take ownership; the voltage at that location will determine what other substation and transformer equipment Critical Operations need, and perhaps most critically, the backup power source.
Some Critical Operations take the full 100+ kVA supply from the utility main transmission line and have large substations onsite. Some take power from the utility that's been stepped down once to something closer to 12-15kVA but also have generators that operate at that same level, so the final step-down happens inside the facility, regardless of where the power is being supplied from. Still others take power that's been fully reduced to site operating levels (typically 480V) via a utility reducing station and a “campus” reducing station, and then also run their generators at this voltage.MicrogridsA microgrid is a small-scale, localized utility-source system that can disconnect from the larger, more traditional utility-source grid (i.e., the public or privately-owned power plants and distribution centers) either partially or completely. A microgrid can operate autonomously, providing its own generation, storage, and transmission of electrical energy, though typically at a low voltage. In this way, it is an excellent source of both small-scale energy production and a powerful backup option for any interruptions to the power provided by the larger utility-source grid.  With all this in mind, you may think that any Critical Operations with a backup power source would be considered a microgrid, but that's not entirely accurate. This is particularly relevant in a campus setting, where the backup power will be the supply for multiple loads, both critical and non-critical, and needs to be able do so for an extended period of time. 
Additionally, using only a petro-fuel based generator as the sole source of power, without the support of the main utility grid, is limited by how much fuel storage is onsite (and subsequently, how often fuel deliveries would be required). A true microgrid setup is going to have some kind of co-generation plant and/or standalone power plant such as biomass, solar, or wind power.High vs. Medium Voltage SystemsWhen discussing utility supply power levels, there is some difficulty in clearly quantifying power levels, particularly the upper and lower boundaries for medium voltage systems. For the purposes of grid connections, let's just consider the utility supply lines at the point where Critical Operations take ownership; the voltage at that location will determine what other substation and transformer equipment Critical Operations need, and perhaps most critically, the backup power source.
Some Critical Operations take the full 100+ kVA supply from the utility main transmission line and have large substations onsite.

Still others take power that's been fully reduced to site operating levels (typically 480V) via a utility reducing station and a “campus” reducing station, and then also run their generators at this voltage.ternative Power SourcesMost of the power sources you are familiar with are the more traditional types, such as utility-supplied or battery-supplied. These days, there are more alternative energy sources available as we look to find clean, renewable options for power. As the technology improves, these alternative power sources are becoming more available and prevalent in both residential and commercial implementations—including Critical Operations. 
As a facilities operator, it will benefit you to be aware of these alternative power sources and be prepared to potentially interact with them in a Critical Operations facility. In this topic, you will identify alternative sources of power.

Thus, rapid learning accelerates the process of acquiring knowledge and skills compared to traditional learning methods. When teachers use rapid learning principles to help students grasp new knowledge, develop skills quickly and retain them efficiently, it can help them bridge their learning gaps or accelerate learning.It is one of those methods that can help students with learning gaps and other students generally. When a class of students are said to have learning gaps, it means that there are disparities in knowledge and skills that exist among these students, often resulting from differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs. 

Such students are to be provided with targeted interventions and support to bridge these gaps and help them catch up to grade-level expectations. An example of such intervention is remediation. Remediation, which is a dimension of rapid learning, entails personalized strategies such as targeted assessments, small group instruction and tutoring to address learning gaps and help students catch up. g strategies to support students in their learning journRemediationRemediation is specifically used to close learning gaps or for overcoming academic challenges, such as in mastering prior knowledge and concepts in struggling students, while accelerated learning, another dimension of rapid learning, is used to foster fast and efficient learning for students who are doing well already and want to learn faster say, in preparation for an exam. Remediation can have two different approaches. Traditional remediation or simply remediation and rapid remediation.  Rapid remediation is a more focused and time-sensitive approach than traditional remediation. It aims to quickly close learning gaps or deficits in a specific area so that students can catch up with their peers or meet specific academic goals. It also entails more intensive support. 
It is important to know that although all rapid learning processes can significantly help students learn faster and more efficiently, they, however, don’t guarantee mastery of the subject, as achieving true mastery will likely require extensive practice, application of knowledge, and a deep understanding of the subject matter. Rapid learning can be an essential step in the learning process, but it's usually just one component on the path to mastery.Rapid Remediation Rapid remediation often employs targeted interventions and concentrated instruction. It may use specialized techniques and resources to speed up the learning process. It is flexible and adaptable. As students make rapid progress, the level of support may be adjusted to align with their evolving needs.  Educators involved in rapid remediation may need to receive specialized training to enhance their ability to provide efficient and effective support.Collaboration among educators, specialists, parents, and students is essential to ensure a coordinated effort to close learning gaps rapidly. Some of the features of rapid remediation include a defined timeline, specific goals and a sense of urgency. It is typically used when preparing students for upcoming assessments or bringing them up to grade level within a short period. It entails pushing the student to grasp concepts at a faster pace than the student is used to.

The key idea behind rapid remediation is to intervene swiftly, provide the most targeted support possible, and expedite students' progress toward grade-level or curriculum standards. It's particularly important for preventing long-term learning gaps and helping students get back on track quickly.  If you're looking for an approach that swiftly closes learning gaps, rapid remediation would be the choice. If you're emphasizing a more comprehensive, gradual process for closing learning gaps, then remediation is the appropriate course.What Are the Principles of Rapid Learning?Here are some of the principles of rapid learning:Chunking This entails selecting specific and related aspects or contents to be learnt quickly and efficiently.Repetition Engagement Assessment Organization Course Modules Module 1 Introduction to Rapid Learning and Its Applications 1.

Lesson Summary 1 Module 2 Closing Learning Gaps With Remediation Module 3 Closing Learning Gaps With Rapid Remediation 
What Is a Learning Gap?  Learning gaps refer to disparities in knowledge and skills among students due to differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs. In providing rapid learning, uncovering learning gaps is important, and it involves looking into what students can't do and what they can do. We uncover these learning gaps through diagnostic assessments, formative assessments, or teacher observations. Learning gaps identify areas where individual students need additional support - that is, what they know, what they don't know or haven't mastered and for which they need additional support. There are instances, where students who could easily succeed don't because of a learning gap, and this can negatively affect them now and in the future. 
Thus, teachers need to uncover individual student's learning gaps to prevent skill gaps that could affect the student's confidence and impede student achievement and also to promote educational equity. When learning gaps are uncovered at any point in time, the teacher should provide personalized instruction and support such as remediation or rapid remediation. Applying Rapid Learning Here are some examples of the applications of rapid learning in education and personal development:Exam Preparation From the time a student starts to prepare for important exams, rapid learning can help in fostering quick and efficient learning and in selecting the best and most efficient resources and materials needed to guarantee passing the exams.Language Acquisition Skill Development Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving STEM EducationLesson SummaryIn this module, you have learned that:Rapid learning, also known as fast-paced learning is the acquisition of new knowledge or skills quickly and efficiently. 
Remediation, a dimension of rapid learning, is specifically used to close learning gaps or to overcome academic challenges, such as in mastering prior knowledge and concepts in struggling students.
Rapid remediation typically has a defined timeline and specific goals, and a sense of urgency, such as preparing students for upcoming assessments or bringing them up to grade level within a short period.
Learning gaps refer to disparities in knowledge and skills among students due to differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs.
Achievement gaps are disparities in academic performance or achievement levels between different groups of students, such as between white students and black students or between children of the rich and children of the poor.
By using the diagnosis of learning gaps as a foundation, educators can design learning objectives.
Rapid learning can be applied in education and personal development.
To better appreciate the importance of rapid learning, it is important to understand the dimensions of rapid learning.Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module, you will be able to:Outline the eleven-step process of closing learning gaps through remediation.Recall that clear and achievable objectives for the remediation process are crucial for guiding and measuring progress.Evaluate appropriate strategies for remediation based on defined objectives, ensuring alignment and effectiveness.Apply active learning strategies to engage students holistically in the learning experience, moving beyond the passive reception of information.Identify spaced practice as a valuable strategy that entails revisiting and reviewing previously learned material at intervals to enhance retention and understanding.Outline the process of providing effective feedback and reinforcement, which includes constructive guidance, recognition of achievements, and addressing misconceptions.Describe the quPreliminary Phase for an Effective Remediation Closing learning gaps through remediation has to follow eleven steps which are categorized in three phases - the preliminary phase, the core phase and the final phase. 

The preliminary phase contains just four steps. These steps are important for assessing the situation and guaranteeing effective remediation. The challenge for many teachers is to make the right choices and decisions in the preliminary phase because the steps greatly determine the outcome of the remediation process.The Four Steps of the Preliminary PhaseAssessment and diagnosisDefining clear objectives for remediation
Choosing appropriate strategies based on the objectives
Choosing appropriate learning and teaching resources and materialsick follow-up step in remediation with precision, including conducting regular follow-up sessions, ongoing assessments, and adaptive strategy adjustments.The Core Phase for Effective Remediation This core phase has a distinctive set of characteristics. The core phase has the students doing most of the work, unlike the preliminary phase, where you do all the work. In addition to this, the core phase is where most of the teaching and learning occurs in the entire remediation process.The core phase acknowledges the teacher as a dynamic leader, firmly grounded and respected by students. The teacher must motivate and engage the students to accelerate their learning and achieve their educational goals effectively.There are five steps in the core phase:Active Learning
Immediate Practice
Feedback and Reinforcement
Recap and Summarize
Homework for Immediate ApplicatioThe Final Phase The final phase signifies the end of the remediation process if the learning gaps have been closed. Otherwise, it's more accurate to think of it as a transition phase. It then serves as a phase that is designed to guarantee continuous development. Let's delve into this phase and its significance:The final phase is designed for evaluation and collaboration for sustainability. The evaluation in the final phase often involves assessing the effectiveness of the remediation strategies that have been implemented. Adjustments can be made to the strategies, learning objectives, or resources used. If the strategies have proven highly effective, they can be reinforced or continued by the students, parents, and even the teacher who is overseeing the process. 
Conversely, if some strategies haven't yielded the desired results, they can be modified or replaced in preparation for another cycle of remediation to improve the overall outcomes. And, of course, all these are documented to inform future decisions and adaptations. Also, support from parents, guardians, or support networks is crucial in this phase for sustainability. Collaborating with these stakeholders can particularly play a pivotal role in maintaining and furthering the student's development.Lesson SummaryIn this module, you have learned that:Closing learning gaps through remediation involves eleven steps from start to finish.
In examining the student, it is important that we use all available tools and resources for the diagnosis and assessment, as this can help us detect patterns in student difficulties.
Defining clear objectives for remediation is one of the most important steps in the entire remediation process.
Effective remediation depends on our choices of strategies based on the objectives.
In the core phase, the students do most of the work, unlike in the preliminary phase, where you do all the work.
Engaging students via active learning engagement entails involving students in the entire learning experience, not just in listening to what is being taught.
Revisiting and reviewing previously learned material at intervals over weeks or months or spaced practice is a valuable strategy in remediation.
In the remediation process, feedback and reinforcement encompass several elements, including offering constructive guidance, acknowledging achievements, addressing misconceptions, and encouraging practice.
The quick follow-up step in the remediation process involves three key featuLearning OutcomesHaving completed this module, you will be able to:Define rapid remediation and its significance for efficient knowledge acquisition.Explain the concept of rapid remediation and its role in closing critical learning gaps.Describe the key characteristics of rapid remediation, emphasizing its speed and targeted strategies.Analyze the importance of diagnosing learning gaps for effective rapid remediation objectives.Discuss the application of rapid remediation in educational and personal development contexts.Identify the roles of the steps in rapid remediation for quick learning acquisition and skill development.Explain educators' role in implementing rapid learning strategies to support students.Outline the eleven-step process for closing learning gaps through rapid remediation.Recognize the significance of immediate practice, feedback, reinforcement, and collaboration in rapid remediation.res - regular quick follow-ups, ongoing assessments, and adaptive strategy adjustment.The Preliminary Phase in Rapid Remediation Recall that rapid remediation is characterized by its speed, immediate focus on critical gaps, and highly targeted strategies to achieve rapid results. Closing learning gaps through rapid remediation also entails eleven steps from start to finish, which are categorized into three phases - the preliminary phase, the core phase and the final phase.

The preliminary phase contains just four steps. This phase is important for assessing the situation and guaranteeing rapid progress from the targeted interventions in a short time.The Four Steps of the Preliminary PhaseAssessment and diagnosisSelecting critical objectivesAligning strategies with the critical objectivesChoosing appropriate learning and teaching resources and materialsThe Core Phase The core phase in a rapid remediation process is a critical phase that shifts from the intensive diagnosis and initial planning to active engagement and implementation of targeted strategies. The purpose of the core phase is to provide student-centered learning in line with the identified critical objectives.The critical phase is a more hands-on phase, where the student is actively engaged and learning, and It's a pivotal phase toward achieving the rapid results that are the hallmark of a rapid remediation approach to closing learning gaps.
More specifically, the core phase is designed to extensively close learning gaps and also help students achieve mastery of the subject matter. In this phase, students are empowered to acquire knowledge and skills fast in a way that guarantees that they can apply the same knowledge and skills effectively.Quick Follow-up Follow-ups are essential to track the effectiveness of the remediation process, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that students continue to progress toward their learning objectives. They provide a structured approach to ongoing improvement and success:Objectives: The process begins with analyzing the well-defined learning objectives to measure progress.Assessment: It evaluates the assessments that were conducted and how well students met these objectives. Feedback Loop: Constructive feedback is provided to students based on findings in 1 and 2 above.Adjustments: You may need to fine-tune existing methods, introduce new ones, or offer additional support to address identified challenges.Individualized Support: In situations where more than one student is involved, one may need to provide individualized support, which could include tailored exercises, one-on-one sessions, or access to specialized resources. This personalized approach ensures that each student's unique needs are addressed.Documentation: Keep comprehensive records, including assessment results, feedback, and any changes made to strategies or objectives. This documentation helps in tracking progress and informing future decisions.Choosing Strategies: MathematicsFor a student with learning gaps in mathematics, the learning objectives for remediation maybe 1. helping students grasp mathematical concepts, 2. enhancing problem-solving skills, and 3. retaining knowledge for better performance in mathematics. For a rapid remediation session, the critical objective is "helping students grasp mathematical concepts" as it forms the basis for enhanced problem-solving skills. The strategies for each are thus:REMEDIATIONRAPID REMEDIATIONTeach systematic problem-solving techniques.Use math games for quick and engaging practice.Provide comprehensive feedback on math homework.Instant feedback during problem-solving activities.A review of foundational math conceptsTeach shortcuts and quick problem-solving techniques. Engage students in discussions, group activities, or peer teaching.Encourage peer collaboration for rapid concept reinforcement.Assign extra practice problems focusing on the identified weak areas.Immediately provide students with exercises to reinforce weak areas.Lesson SummaryIn this module, you have learned that:Rapid remediation is characterized by its speed, immediate focus on critical gaps, and highly targeted strategies to achieve rapid results.In rapid remediation, it is important to uncover the most critical areas of struggle and key knowledge deficits quickly, as time is of the essence.It is important that your choice of strategies align with the critical objective(s).The relevance of Immediate practice in rapid remediation draws on the fact that allowing students to apply what they've just learned strengthens their understanding and retention.Through feedback and reinforcement, students can be empowered to master new concepts quickly.The rapid remediation process generally comes to an end when the learning objectives or specific learning gaps that were the focus of the remediation have been successfully addressed or closed.Follow-ups are essential to track the effectiveness of the rapid remediation process.Collaboration with parents or gLearning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:Compare the performance of the basic strategies with their modified versionsExplain the concept of backtestingDifferentiate between the NR4 Candle and the NR7 CandleCompute the range of a candle using the Narrow Range StrategyDiscuss how to modify an existing strategyuardians creates a unified front in supporting the student's learning journeyDay Trading Strategies

Lesson SummaryThe key points from this module are:Day Trading is about taking positions that you do not carry overnight. That is if you take a position today, then you end up close the position today itself before the end of the day's trading. The main benefit of this is that you do not carry risk overnight. Day Trading involves buying and selling securities through the day to profit from the volatility.The advantages of Day Trading are as follows:Low Capital: It requires a low amount of capital and this is because you do not need to lock in your funds over days, weeks, or months when doing Day Trading.No overnight risk: When doing Day Trading, you are always in control of your position and need not worry about unfavorable development that may happen after markets are closed.Leverage easy: With day trading, you can be more comfortable using leverage since you will be continually monitoring your position and since you do not intend to carry your position overnight, you will be able to close your position fast in case of falling development.A Trading Strategy is a set of rules that are used to trade the market. Your trading strategy will determine if you taking a long or short position.Back Testing involves checking the historical performance of a trading strategy using historical price data. There are two ways of back-testing.Automated Back Testing: This involves creating a script or a code that will automatically do the backtesting for you on the historical data.Manuel Back Testing: This involve Day Trading Strategies tshingombe fiston 63% Finish your profile XP 36530 Get Your Certificates Your Dashboard Your Achievements Recommended For You Career Ready Plan Affiliate Dashboard Create Resumé enChange Language Account Settings FAQs Logout Course Modules Module 1 Basic Day Trading Strategies Module 2 Advanced Day Trading Strategies 1.

There are two indicators of the EDC Strategy.Average Directional Index (ADX): This is used to determine the strength of a trend.Average True Range (ATR): This is a measure of market volatility. It is used to measure the average movement in prices over a period.The rules of the EDC Strategy are to identify a candle for which the ADX goes below 25 (EDC Candle) which will tell the trader that the market has reached an extreme directionless state. You will initiate a Long position if prices go above EDC Candle high first and stop below EDC candle low. You will initiate a Short position if prices go below EDC Candle low first and stop below EDC candle high.An Inside Bar Pattern is a candle with a high price lower than the previous candle and a low price higher than the previous candle.The Complex Trading Strategy is trading by combining the NR$4 candle with the Inside Bar Pattern. You will be trading only those NR4 Candles that are also inside bars.In the Complete Trading Strategy, you identify NR4 candles that are also Inside Bars, you will initiate a buy trade if prices break above this candle's high first and sell if prices break below this candle's low first.

Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to: Explain the structure of employment law including several employment policies and guidelines in the USA.Outline factors which are compulsory to ensure the safety net for employees.Discuss national, federal, and local laws as well as court rulings for employment in the USA.Summarise the structure of employment status and legislatures to ensure the employment laws in the UK.Describe the comprehensive overview of the changes to employee rights in the UK due to COVID-19.Explain the employee rights for post-COVID-19 in the UK.Outline employee rights in the UK during the pandemic situation.Discuss the responsibilities of employers in the UK during tIntroductionThe word "employment law" refers to all elements of employment. It might refer to anything from your contract to anti-discrimination and anti-unfair dismissal legislation. The purpose of employment law is to govern the interaction between employers and employees. Both employers and employees may guarantee that their recruiting and dismissing procedures, as well as their workplace as a whole, are fair to everyone by following appropriate regulations. Employment law also aids in the fight against discrimination and the successful promotion of workplace equality.While employment laws in the United States benefit employers, the contrary is true in the United Kingdom, where regulations support employee protection. Governmental models have an impact on how employment regulations are drafted. The Equality Act 2010 and parental leave rights are two examples of employment regulations in the United Kingdom that match those in other  European nations as a condition of the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union (EU). Some of these laws resemble those of the United States. For example, the Equality Act of 2010 contains protections for gender reassignment and civil unions, in addition to the same protected groups as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In this study, we will highlight the employment law of the USA and UK in detail.he pandemic with respect to employee rights.What Does Employment Law Cover?Employment law is a broad field of law that covers a wide range of issues that arise in the workplace, primarily guiding processes and policies that you might implement. Because employment law covers such a broad variety of topics, a comprehensive description of all the areas where it applies would take up a whole page. Employment contracts, equal pay, holiday entitlement and pay, working hours, grievance procedures, disciplinary procedures, maternity and paternity leave, various types of discrimination, equality and diversity in the workplace, reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities, the redundancy process, and much more are some of the most common areas that you'll likely come into contact with as a business ownerUSA Legal Framework of Employment LawIn the United States, most employment agreements are assumed to be 'at will,' which implies that an employer can fire an employee at any time and for any reason, as long as the cause isn't illegal. An employee in an at-will employment relationship has the same freedom to leave at any time and for any reason.With or without a documented employment agreement, an employment relationship can be created. Individual written employment agreements are mainly limited to executive-level workers in the United States, while collective bargaining agreements may cover other employment arrangements. Written employment agreements usually include provisions addressing the employment term, salary and other compensation (such as bonuses), benefits, job responsibilities, ownership of work product (work for hire), termination, dispute resolution processes, and how the employment contract may be renewed or amended. Restrictive covenants, which prevent the parties from performing particular acts during the employment term or for a time after termination, may be included in these agreementsUSA Legal Framework of Employment LawThe United States, being a common law and federal country with fifty (50) states and many city governments, lacks a single set of codified labor and employment rules that apply to all companies. Rather, the regulations that govern job relationships come from a variety of contexts.Federal statutesNational statutesLocal LawsFederal LawsCourt rulingsFederal laws control employment relationships in the United States and apply to all employers who engage in interstate commerce. They establish minimum employment standards and rights. Wages, hours, medical leaves of absence, discrimination, trade unions and bargaining with trade unions, mass layoffs, and plant closures are all covered by federal statutes. Furthermore, immigration and work permits are applicable to all employers which are governed by federal law; regardless of size or industry.More Employment Policies and GuidelinesAffordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act - Nursing Mothers: Employers are required to offer nursing mothers with a private place for their needs under the terms of the ACA.Background Check LawWorkplace Breaks RulesChild Labor LawsCompensatory TimeDrug Testing LawsEmployee or Independent ContractorFactors for the Safeguards of Federal EmployeesThe US Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing around 180 federal labor laws. Also, the Fair Labor Standards Act created a federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour; however individual states may have chosen a higher rate. On the other hand, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in charge of enforcing workplace safety rules (OSHA). Unemployment insurance benefits are provided through a combined federal-state program that is financed by a payroll levy on employees and employers. To secure the protection for the employees there is U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which works to secure the rights of the citizen in respect of employment. Here are eight important factors for the safeguards of the federal employeesThe Minimum Wage and Medical InsuranceThe Minimum WageMedical InsuranceThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) assures that all American workers be paid at least the federal minimum wage. Most private and governmental firms have been required to pay employees at least $7.25 per hour since 2009; however some politicians have attempted to increase that figure. In addition, the FLSA guarantees that nonexempt employees will be paid time and a half for any overtime they work. 
Minors are also given particular safeguards under the law. It restricts the amount of hours that minors under the age of 16 can work in non-agricultural jobs. Furthermore, the FLSA forbids employers from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for certain high-risk positions.Safety in the WorkplaceThe 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act went a great way in reducing workplace risks in the United States. Several specialized safety regulations were included in the Act, including construction, marine, and agricultural industry-specific rules. A "General Duty Clause" is also included in the legislation, which forbids any working conduct that poses a demonstrable risk to employees. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in charge of enforcing the legislation, however, state agencies may be involved in some aspects. Self-employed people and those who work on small family farms, for example, are free from the rule, despite the fact that most workers benefit from it. President Joe Biden requested OSHA to establish an emergency interim regulation on September 9, 2021, requiring firms to comply with certain requirements. The Social Security AdministrationIn 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, creating a financial safety net for elderly and handicapped Americans. About 55.6 million people received Social Security checks each month as of July 2021 (the most recent figures available as of early September), with an average amount of $1,543 for retirees and $1,277 for citizens with disabilities. These benefits are paid for by a payroll tax, which may appear on your pay stub as "OASDI." Employers and workers each contribute 6.2 per cent of a staff member's yearly salary, up to a maximum annual contribution. Self-employed people pay the entire cost of the tax, which amounts to 12.4% of their earnings; 50% of the amount is tax-exempted.Unemployment Insurance WhistleblowersFamily LeaveDespite the fact that each state has its own unemployment insurance agency, unemployment benefits are provided through a federal-state partnership. States are in charge of unemployment compensation, but they must adhere to strict federal criteria. Individuals must have been jobless for causes beyond their control—for example, a layoff or termination—and must fulfil state-specific principles to be eligible for benefits. Workers can get benefits for up to 26 weeks in most situations; however, payments are occasionally extended during economic downturns. The unemployment system in the United States assures that Americans have at least a few months of security when they temporarily quit working, albeit it is not as generous as in certain European nations. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, President Biden's American Rescue Plan extends federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week until September 6, 2021.iscrimination in the WorkplaceThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked a turning point in American social justice, particularly in the area of employment. Businesses could no longer discriminate on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which was passed 45 years later, improved workplace rights by outlawing salary discrimination against women and minorities. The Supreme Court decided on June 15, 2020, in Bostock vs. Clayton County, Georgia, that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act's anti-discrimination provisions protect LGBTQ workers.  "Today, we must consider whether an employer can dismiss someone solely for being homosexual or transgender," wrote by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. The solution is obvious. An employer who terminates a person for being homosexual or transgender does so for features or acts that it would not question in someone of the opposite sex. Title VII prevents sex from playing an essential and undisguised part in the decision. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which applies to employees 40 years and older, and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 are two more federal labor laws that safeguard against workplace inequity (AEmployee Rights in the UKThe employment status of an employee determines their rights. Several variables can influence this:The nature of the jobPayment optionsWho is responsible for paying your taxes?Under the legislation, there are three primary forms of job status. Employees are individuals who have an employment contract, whereas workers are those who have a service contract. On the other hand, Self-employed people include business proprietors, freelancers, and contractors. 
Keeping track of important employment laws in the UK is a wonderful method to stay on top of them. The essential aspects of employment law are encapsulated in a core collection of legislation. It is significantly less probable to disobey these rules and obligations as an employer if you are reminded of them on a frequent basisEmployee Rights in the UKThe most important pieces of employment law legislation, as well as critical information about these laws, are included here.Employment Rights Act Employment Rights Act of 1996 (ERA): This legislation, which replaces an older Labour Law, protects employees' rights in situations such as dismissal, unfair termination, paternity leave, maternity benefits, and redundancy.The National Minimum WageEmployment Relations ActMaternity and Parental LeaveMust Receive a Pay SlipA pay slip should be issued on or before the day you are paid. It must include a full breakdown of your salary for the appropriate time period, as well as any deductions such as taxation and National insurance. Your company has the option of providing pay slips on paper or electronically. A payslip for an employee must include the following information:Total pay before and after deductions (the gross amount and net amount respectively) Variable deductions, which vary based on the amount of money you earn. Variable deductions include tax, national insurance, student loan repayments, and pension contributions. Deductions that are predetermined. These can also be mentioned in a separate statement that must be put out before the first pay slip is issued and updated annually. Your tax code may be included on your pay slipNo Discrimination When someone is treated unjustly at work because of traits protected by the Equality Act 2010, this is known as discrimination. The rights of the employees that are protected are Age, Disability, Gender reassignment, Marriage or civil partnership, Pregnancy or maternity, Race and Religion or belief.Direct DiscriminationIndirect DiscriminationWhen someone is treated unfairly because of a protected feature, this is known as direct discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs when rules that apply to a group of employees or applicants are reasonable in theory but less fair to a specific protected characteristic in practice. For example, if a pregnant woman was absent due to morning sickness and an employer used this as justification for disciplinary action against her attendance record, this would be direct discrimination. DiscriminationHowever, discrimination can be justified in some cases, which is known as objective justification. For example, if a surgeon's eyesight has worsened to the extent that they are unable to do surgeries, the surgeon's employer would be justified in modifying the surgeon's responsibilities to safeguard patients. 
If you believe you are being discriminated against at work, then you can determine if you are covered by the law or determine whether your employer is accountable; and determine the type of discrimination that applies to your circumstance (there may be more than one situation). After that, you may determine what steps to follow and whether or not to seek legal guidance.Health and Safety RegulationsEmployers are required under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) to create a safe and healthy working environment for their workers. This involves providing toilets, wash basins, and clean drinking water, as well as keeping the workplace clean, ventilated, and properly illuminated, as well as maintaining any equipment utilized. 
Sick Pay Is a Legal Requirement:
Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) of £95.85 per week is available to eligible employees. You must have: 
Worked for your companyEarned an average of at least £120 per week before taxBeen sick, self-isolating, or shielding for at least four days consecutively (including non-working days)SSP is available for up to 28 weeks. The number of days you can get depends on why you're not working. You can earn SSP during the period mentioned in the letter urging you to shield from coronavirus if you're shielding against corona virus. If you have to self-isolate and are unable to work from home, you can collect SSP for every day. To qualify, you must self-isolate for at least four days. Unless you're sick for a reason other than coronavirus, you can start getting SSP on the fourth day of your absence. The three days preceding this are known as "waiting days," and you can only be compensated for them if you got SSP within the previous eight weeks, which included a three-day waiting perMaternity Leave and PayMaternity Leave Maternity PayEmployees have the option of taking 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave. Ordinary Maternity Leave is defined as the first 26 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. Additional Maternity Leave is the last 26 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. You do not need to complete all 52 weeks. You must, however, take two weeks off following the birth of your child, or four weeks if you work in manufacturing. While you're on maternity leave, all of your employment rights are preserved.Paternity Leave and PayPaternity Leave Paternity Pay Employees have the right to take paternity leave if their spouse gives birth to a child, as long as they give the proper notice. You must have worked for the same job for at least 26 weeks up until any day during the 15th week before the baby's due date (known as the qualifying week). You have the option of taking one or two weeks. They must be taken all at once, and you must return to work within 56 days after the delivery. While you're on paternity leave, all of your employee rights are preserved.Flexible WorkingYou have the right to ask for a more flexible schedule. Employees who have worked for the same company for a minimum of 26 weeks have the right to seek flexible working hours (known as making a statutory application). This is a once-a-year application. To make the request, you must write to your employer with the following information:The dateA declaration that this is a statutory requestDetails of how you want to work flexiblyWhen you want to startAn explanation of how flexible working may affect the business and how this may be addressedWithin three months, your employer must make a decision. If they approve your request, they must amend the terms and circumstances of your contract. If they decline, they must justify their choice based on commercial considerations. If you have a case, you can file a complaint with a tribunal.Leave, Notice Period and Redundancy PayLeave TimeNotice PeriodRedundancy PayEmployers must give at least 28 days of paid annual leave per year to employees who work a five-day week. This may include weekends and holidays. You can earn vacation time when on maternity, paternity, or adoption leave, as well as while you're unwell.Protection Against Unfair DismissalIf an employer chooses to cancel an employment contract, they must provide a legal cause. They must also follow a fair procedure throughout the process and provide the stipulated amount of notice in the contract (unless it is less than the statutory minimum notice time). For one of the following reasons, a reasonable dismissal occurs:Your demeanorYour competence to do your dutiesRedundancyYou no longer fulfill a legal condition that allows you to do your job (for example, if you had to drive but lost your license)Outside of these four reasons, you can have your contract cancelled for any other significant cause. There are various instances where dismissal might be deemed unjust. To be legally protected against unjust dismissal, you must have been employed by your employer for a minimum of two years.Protection Against Unfair DismissalHowever, there are rare cases of unjust dismissal in which you are protected from the start.These are some of them:Whistleblowing (if you expose misconduct you've witnessed at work)Being fired because of a protected trait, such as race, religion, pregnancy, or sexual orientationRefusing to give up a statutory right, such as the right to a break or asking for flexible working hours.If an employment tribunal rules that dismissal was unjust, employers must compensate former workers. This can be up to one year's income, with a maximum of £86,444 available (whichever is lower). Keep track of your rights as an employee and you'll be able to see when they're being violated. If you want legal assistance, please contact our experienced employment attorneys.Employee Rights During the PandemicThe COVID-19 outbreak has changed the working lives of many people. Whether you are still working, but with new events, on vacation or working from home full time, things are very different than usual. These are tough times, but there are laws, guidelines, and financial support to help you get through this. Here's what you need to know about your COVID-19 employee rights. 
Not everyone can work from home. Understandably, you may be stressed or afraid to go to and from work during the pandemic. Employers must take measures to ensure that their employees are as safe as possible at work. Covid-Protected WorkstationsPriority actions for your workplace will depend on the category to which they belong. Some jobs will fall into more than one category - for example, if you have an office. as well as a warehouse

It was extended until September 30, 2021. Employees who have been furloughed might be on any form of employment contract, including full-time, part-time, agency, flexible, or zero-hour contracts. Your company applies for a grant to replace 80 per cent of your typical wage for hours not worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, once you've been placed on furlough. They must have written you a letter confirming your vacation or struck an arrangement with a labor union. 
Since they can apply is determined by how long you've been with them.If you were hired between March 20 2020 and October 30 2020, your employer can claim for periods ending on or before April 30 2021 if they submitted PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) to HMRC between those dates.If you started working on March 2nd, 2021, your employer can claim for periods beginning on or after May 1st, 2021, if they reported PAYE RTI to HMRC between March 20th, 2020 and March 2nd, 2021.Employers must follow equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation when making choices concerning the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It is your employer's responsibility to pay you the amount to which you are entitled. During your leave, you are not permitted to do any work for them.The Self-Employment Income Support SchemeFurloughs are not possible for self-employed people. However, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) may be able to help you out. Previous grants have totaled three. This year's Budget included the fourth.

Basically, an audit is conducted by collecting evidence and establishing findings, based on the following activities:
• Document reviews
• Onsite visits
• Interviews
• Verification
• Evaluation Gathering EvidenceEVIDENCE GATHERINGBEHAVIOURRECORDS HOW TO RECORD AND OBSERVE AUDIT EVIDENCE
Audit evidence collecting is sometimes a tricky and tedious task, but with proper planning, evidence can be gathered, to conduct an effective audit. 

PROBLEM: Collection of audit evidence covering all aspects of the scope, with sufficient depth, is a challenging task for an auditor. 
SOLUTION: To collect proper audit evidence, with sufficient insight and coverage of the audit scope, the following methods should be followed:
• Stick to the audit plan and follow the trail against procedures 
• Employ audit checklists and memory aids cautiously
• Use time optimally (ensuring proper depth and audit spread) 
• Record discussions with team members for consultation and verification
• Use the appropriate data collection methods listed below:
Interviews | Examination of documents | Physical observation of site activities and conditions | Follow trails; try to trace and review linkages | Follow-up on previous audit findings Auditor Approach and Document ReviewAUDITING APPROACH What should the auditor approach be for conducting an audit?
 
The audit approach should be friendly, but objectivity should be maintained. The following auditor traits should be followed:
 Be calm and polite 
 Meet area representatives first 
 Explain the purpose of the audit 
 Never act superior 
 Start with easy questions 
 Speak clearly and listen carefully 
 Talk personally to those performing the tasksDiscussing QualityQUALITY MANAGEMENTQUALITY OBJECTIVES How is a document review done on a quality management system, based on ISO 9001:2015? 
The basic concept of the document triangle applies to a Quality Management System (QMS). The top level document of the triangle is the policy; in the QMS it is the quality policy. Therefore, quality policy should encompass the considerations of ISO 9001:2015 requirements, as well as the strategic goals of the company. Moreover, the organization is required to consider internal and external issues related to QMS, as a context for the organization. 

Organizations should also identify interested parties related to its context; the organization should analyze risk and opportunities. After the content of the quality policy and the context of the organization is verified, it is important to examine how quality objectives are derived from the policy and context. Then the auditor should examine how the
 Never challenge the auditee
 Record all answers Environmental and Energy System ReviewsENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
ENERGY SYSTEMS How is a document review done on an Environment Management System, based on ISO 14001:2015? 
The document review of an Environmental Management System (EMS), compliant to ISO 14001:2015, can start from the Environment policy and the context of the Environment Management System. 
Based on that, the auditor can verify the risk and opportunities analysis, on internal and external issues, as stated in context and the interested parties’ needs and expectations regarding the environment. The environmental objectives are then verified for whether or not they are derived from the Environmental Policy and critical risk opportunities, highlighted from the organization’s context. Examples of environmental objectives are: reduction in paper consumption by percentage; reduction of CO2 emissions by reduction of power consumption; reduction of air emissions. 

The auditor can see: legal compliance records; legal evaluation regarding compliance; environment performance reports; management reviews on environmental performance; aspect impact analysis and actions to address significant impacts.Interview and Questioning TechniquesINTERVIEWS WHY ARE INTERVIEWS DONE IN AN AUDIT?
Interviews are done in an audit, in order to achieve the following:
• Develop subject matter 
• Stimulate interest 
• Obtain a balanced view 
• Provoke thought 
• Get true responses 
• Gather data 
• Identify interviewees' knowledge and understanding 
• Simplify conclusions INTERVIEW TECHNIQUESAudit Findings and ClosingFINDINGSFINALIZATIONCLOSING MEETING WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF FINDINGS?
Some of the results of audit findings are:
• Supported evidence 
• Accurate, clear, unambiguous, objective information
• Information with relevant clauses and procedures 
• Information identified by functional areasModule One Summary
ISO 19011 is an International standard published by the International Organization for Standardization. This standard provides assistance on auditing management systems.
An audit is defined as a systematic, independent, documented process, established to obtain evidence regarding an organisation's management and processes. This evidence is evaluated in accordance with the specific audit criteria.
Audit criteria are reference standards against which a management system is checked. 
Audit evidence is defined as records, statements of fact and other useful information, relevant to the audit criteria, that can be verified.
Audit findings are the results of the evaluation of the collected audit evidence.
Conformity is explained as the fulfillment of a requirement.Module One Summary
First Party Audit: Audit by the internal auditing function of the organisation, requested by the management itself. 
Second Party Audit: Audit of a supplier by a customer.
Third Party Audit: Audit of an organisation, by an independent auditing company/agent.
A lead auditor is the "captain" of the auditing team and steers the audit in the correct direction, without being misled by distractions.
The auditee is the party being audited. 
The audit team is selected on the basis of their auditing skills, experience, sector relevancy and availability. 
The audit scope is defined as the extent and boundaries of the audit. 
The audit plan is described as the activities and arrangements of an audit.Learning OutcomesAfter completing this module you will be able to:Describe the process of conducting an auditDiscuss the starting point of an auditUnderstand how non-conformance to requirements is reportedExplain how audit requirements vary with different management systemsSummarise the expectations of clients from auditsOutline how audit findings are followed-upPolicy DocumentsPOLICYDOCUMENT WHAT IS POLICY?

 Check the overall systemDeviation FindingRESULTSDEVIATION WHAT IS AUDIT REPORTING AND HOW IS IT DONE?
Audit reporting is the most important part of an audit. It is the evidence that shows the management system has been assessed with findings and conclusions based on standard audit criteria. Auditors have to identify two types of results during the reporting of an audit:
1. Exemplary Practice or Conformance - A practice, procedure, or instruction that meets the requirements, or is well above the expected requirements of an operating procedure. This is normally reported as conformance in an audit report. 
2. Deviation Finding – A deviation finding is due to the reasons presented on the following tab.Non-ConformanceAUDIT FINDINGSNON-CONFORMANCENC STATEMENTHOW MANY TYPES OF AUDIT FINDINGS ARE REPORTED?
There are usually three types of audit findings reported: 
Major NC (Non-Compliance) - is a total absence of a complete requirement in terms of documentation or implementation. A number of minor deviations spreading over a larger area is also termed as Major NC.
Minor NC - is an isolated incidence or a lapse or slippage on documentation or implementation of a standard requirement.
Observation - is a potential nonconformity or opinion regarding a condition not covered by a standard.Non-Conformance StatementsPOOR NC STATEMENTSEXAMPLES OF POOR NON-CONFORMITY STATEMENTS:
“Quality objectives were not defined”.
“Test equipment was not calibrated”.
“Training was not provided.”
“Identification of material was missing”.
“Obsolete work instruction was used.”
“The procedure for testing was wrong”.
“Job description was not available.” 
Avoid Statements Blaming People - Blame The System!
A Non-Conformity statement blaming people: “An operator XGHJS did not know how to repair the machine”.
A Non-Conformity statement blaming the system: “The operator was not properly trained to repair the machine”.Audit ResultsAUDIT RESULTSMAJOR NCAudit Results Communication is an important part of an audit. It involves actions that include:
• Follow-up on observations and non-conformities.
• Analysis of corrective actions and their effectiveness.
• Summary of audit closure status shared for management reviews.Minor Non-ConformanceMINOR NCOBSERVATIONDOCUMENTATIONIMAGEWHAT IS MINOR NON-CONFORMANCE?
Any shortcoming of the audited management system, which is not able to satisfy a written requirement of the standard or procedure and is an isolated event. Thus, it is not reflected as a major nonconformity.
Minor non-conformities (Minor NC) can be identified by the following criteria: 
• Minor non-conformity indicates the issue is not significant.
• The management system is not at stake or subject to high risk.Quality ReportingREPORTING MECHANISMS WHAT IS REPORTING DURING AN AUDIT?
Reporting in an audit is given by communicating the outcome of the audit.
Reporting during an audit is done in many ways and is not limited to the preparation of the final written report. It involves the following:
• Verbal and written reporting at all stages
• Report outcomes comprehensively
• Verification and confirmation of both conformances and non-conformances
• Report should add value to the management system
• This is referred to as a disturbance in the system.
• An isolated instance where a standard requirement has not been met.Style and ContentSTYLECONTENT What should the writing style be in an audit report? 
Audit reports should have the following writing style:
• Simple language
• To the point
• Use of passive/reported speech, avoiding pronouns
• Do not use abbreviationsCorrections and Follow-up ActivitiesINTRODUCTIONCORRECTIONSWHAT ARE AUDIT FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES?


Audit follow-up activities include the following: 
• Observe corrective actions and correction plans.
• Ensure implementation of actions proposed.
• After the acceptance of proposed actions, this should be formulated in an action plan.
• The plan should have a target timeline for every action point.
• The next audit date is proposed as an audit follow-up activity.
• The timing of the next audit will be agreed by the seriousness of the non-conformities.Corrections and ResponsibilityCORRECTIVE ACTIONTARGET DATERESPONSIBILITY WHAT IS CORRECTIVE ACTION?
Corrective action is an action that is taken to eradicate the root cause of a non-conformity, so as to avoid reccurrence in the future. 
For example with a defective product, a re-work was the correction. However action needs to be taken to prevent the defect arising again. Treatment to the production line is a corrective action. This same concept is applied in management systems.Measuring EffectivenessNC CLOSURE What types of follow-ups are done for closure of non-conformities?
Non-conformity closure is the status of non-conformity, where both correction and corrective action has been taken. In good manufacturing practice, effectiveness of the actions taken is included in the closure. 
There are two main types of closure of non-conformities, arising from an audit of a management system:
1) Documented evidence for verification of a non-conformity closure; this is done in the case of minor non-conformities.
2) A re-verification audit for verification of a non-conformity closure; this is done in the case of major non-conformity.
In the example of a defective product again, documented closure can be made, with evidence that corrections and corrective action has been taken. However, the effectiveness of the actions taken must be verified in the current production runs of the product.ase StudiesCASE STUDY 1CASE STUDY 2CASE STUDY 3READ THE FOLLOWING CASE STUDY (texts are available in the Course Resources section). 

Note: The reading material for this case is from: Text 1.doc

TASK 1: Analyze the situation in the case, to assess whether or not there is a non-conformity. 
CASE INCIDENT 1: In the audit of a brush manufacturer, the auditor noticed 6 brushes of an unknown product in an unmarked box under the production line. The brushes were unmarked and the operator told the auditor that they were left from the previous shift and that he thought they may be "reject brushes".
TASK 2: If there is a non-conformity, select the appropriate clause that is violated, by completing the question on the following set of slides. If non-conformity does not exist, select: non-conformity is not applicable. Module Two Summary
Policy is a top level document. Policy tells about an organization’s culture, commitment and focal areas of improvement. Policy is checked for false claims, continuing applicability, practicability and links to other polices.
A management system program, is a program developed by a management system, to achieve objective targets, with defined action plans and target dates.
All employees should have awareness of the policies and consequences of their own tasks, as defined by the objectives of the management system.
An auditor verifies whether or not an organization has established procedures, to ensure that documents are controlled in proper ways, to address the following issues:
• Can be located, reviewed and revised
• Are the current version
• Are not obsolete or have been removed
• Are legible and dated
• Include dates of revisions where applicable
• Have a retention periodOn successful completion of this module, you will be able to:  Define what alternative dispute resolution (ADR) isIdentify the benefits of using ADR
Describe the national principles of resolving dispute resolution
Describe the role of an ADR practitioner
Explain various aspects of preparing for ADR ScenarioImagine that you’ve been wronged by a supplier, by your employer, or by a business where you are a customer. You’ve correctly determined that you have an actionable legal claim. What are you going to do?
You probably won’t run to the courthouse to file a formal complaint to initiate litigation. This is because litigation is very expensive and time consuming. Besides, you may wish to continue doing business with the supplier, employer, or business.
Perhaps the matter is of a private nature, and you do not want to engage in a public process to determine the outcome. You would like the dispute to be resolved, but you do not want to engage in public, time consuming, expensive litigation to do it.
A common method of dispute resolution that avoids many of the challenges associated with litigation is alternative dispute resolution (ADR).
Identify the level of confidentiality in ADR What is ADR? ADR involves resolving disputes outside of the judicial process, though the judiciary can require parties to participate in specific types of ADR, such as arbitration, for some types of conflicts.Moreover, some ADR methods vest power to resolve the dispute in a neutral party, while other strategies vest that power in the parties themselves. 
Common methods of ADR include negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. 
Lesser used methods of ADR include mini-trials, hybrid forms of mediation-arbitration (with elements of both), and collaborative goal-oriented processes. When is ADR used?ADR is often used to resolve disputes among businesses, employers and employees, and businesses and consumers. ADR can also be used in many other types of conflicts. For instance, ADR strategies can be used in domestic law cases, such as divorce, or in international legal issues, such as issues relating 
to trans-boundary pollution. ADR methods are used outside of the courtroom, but that does not mean that they are outside of the interests of our legal system.  Participation in ADR has important legal consequences. For instance, parties that have agreed by contract to be subject to binding arbitration give up their constitutional right to bring their complaint to court.The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is a federal statute under which parties are required to participate in arbitration when they have agreed by contract to do so, even in state court matters. Indeed, the FAA is a national policy favoring arbitration. ADR and YouThere is a very good chance that you will—or already have—signed a contract that contains a mandatory arbitration clause. This means that if a dispute arises under that contract, then you will be required to arbitrate your claim rather than going straight to court. Under a binding arbitration clause, you will have waived your constitutional rights to go to court.
Even if you have never signed such a contract and never will, there is still a good likelihood that you will be involved in a commercial dispute at some point in your life. Because of this, it’s important to understand the ADR process, situations in which litigation is a better choice than ADR, and special issues that arise when parties have unequal bargaining power.ADR PractitionersEach ADR process is different. The amount of time an ADR process takes changes depending on the type of process and the details of your dispute. ADR practitioners are trained to help you and the other people involved to work toward a solution. The role of an ADR practitioner is different depending on the type of ADR process. 

In some ADR processes, the practitioner can give advice or make decisions for you.You should choose the ADR process that sounds as if it will work for you. 
Using ADR can: help you to resolve all or some of the issues in your dispute.provide a fair process.
help you to achieve outcomes that work for everyone involved in the dispute.
Why choose ADR?Resolving your dispute through ADR is different from asking a court or tribunal to resolve your dispute. Using ADR to resolve your dispute can benefit everyone. It means that courts and tribunals can spend their time considering disputes that need a court or tribunal decision. Flexibility ADR processes can be flexible, because the process can be made to suit your particular dispute. 
   -Court processes are generally less flexible. Privacy and Confidentiality
Self-directed






Costhat are the National Principles for Resolving Disputes?NADRAC’s National Principles for Resolving Disputes are about using ADR when you have a dispute instead of going to court—and still using ADR even if you do go to court. They also offer information about how ADR aims to work so that you know what to expect if you choose to use ADR. 
There are 7 national principles:National Principle 1Self-responsibility is the first step.

To resolve your dispute, you need to take responsibility for: 
• being clear about what is in dispute 
• genuinely trying to resolve the dispute 
• seeking support when you need itNational Principle 2Support in Dispute ResolutionSupport People GenerallySome people prefer to have a support person with them in dispute resolution processes, particularly ADR processes; some do not. 
 A support person can add value for all the people involved in resolving the dispute. If you ask someone to be your support person, it is best if they are not directly involved in the dispute. 

If you want to have a support person with you during your ADR process you will need to talk to your ADR practitioner to make sure this is okay. A support person is someone who can: 
• give you emotional and practical support 
• help you understand the issues in dispute and what is important to you 
• gently challenge you if you get stuck on one idea 
• take notes or remind you later of things said. 
Your support person could be: 
• a family member 
• a friend 
• a work colleague 
• a social worker 
• a union representative 
• a counseling psychologist 
• a professional adviser (for example, your lawyer, Support in Dispute ResolutionLawyersA lawyer may be able to help you resolve your dispute, whether you choose to use an ADR process, an ombudsman, or go to a court or tribunal. It is up to you to decide what you want a lawyer to do for you. If your lawyer cannot help you with something, they will tell you so.Lawyers in ADR process:Some ADR processes involve lawyers; some do not. Lawyers can give you advice before and after each ADR session, as they may not be present or may take a ‘backseat’ role during the session. They can also give you advice after the ADR session about what can happen next and how the proposed agreement will work for you. You decide what to do after listening to your lawyer.Lawyers in court or tribunals:A lawyer’s role in a court or tribunal process is more formal than their role in an ADR process. You can choose whether you just want advice from your lawyer, or whether you want them to present your case to the court or tribunal as well. You may choose to present your own case to the court or tribunal. Some courts and many tribunals have user-friendly processes to help you. You decide what to do after listening to your lawyer.Your Role in ADRADR processes are different and your role can be different too. Sometimes you and the other participants may discuss and/or sign a contract before the first ADR session begins. This contract can outline everyone’s roles. For example: In processes like mediation, you usually have a very active role—your role includes listening, talking, and deciding. 
In processes like conciliation, the ADR practitioner may give you advice—your role includes listening, talking ,and deciding. Your decisions include whether you will accept the ADR practitioner’s advice. 
In processes like arbitration, you can have a less active role. You and the other participants present the information and your points of view to the ADR practitioner, who makes the decision based on the information provided.Suggestions for Getting the Most Out of your ADR sessionIf you are participating in ADR, you and the other participants are generally expected to make a genuine effort to reach an agreement. This means that during the ADR process you and the other participants:approach the ADR process with an open-mind listen to the other participants’ points of view and suggestions and tell them your own talk to the other participants openly about the issues in dispute 
provide information to the other participants— when deciding what information to provide, think about what approach you would like the other participants to take in giving you information
are available to meet for the ADR sessions

It sets out clear guidelines for how health and safety are managed within the organisation, as well as the roles and responsibilities of management, employees, and other stakeholders.
A well-defined safety policy demonstrates the organisation’s dedication to protecting its workforce, contractors, visitors, and the public from potential hazards.Click the button to open the modalLegal and Regulatory RequirementsAdhering to legal and regulatory frameworks is crucial for ensuring the safety policy is compliant with national and international laws. These requirements differ across industries and locations, but they typically include standards that employers must meet to safeguard the health and safety of employeeImpact on Organisational Culture and Employee SafetyA well-crafted safety policy not only ensures legal compliance but also facilitates a culture of safety within the organisation. Leadership plays a key role in shaping this culture by actively promoting safety initiatives and holding employees accountable for their safety practices. A strong safety culture leads to proactive behaviours, where employees actively identify and mitigate hazards, creating a safer work environment for all.Health and Safety Objectives Objectives set the foundation for what the safety policy aims to achieve. These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). For example, an objective might be to "reduce workplace incidents by 20% within the next 12 months." By having clear objectives, the organisation can track progress and make adjustments to improve safety outcomes.Health and safety objectives should align with the broader goals of the organisation. For instance, a company focused on reducing operational costs might set an objective to decrease accidents, which in turn reduces costs associated with injury-related downtime.Roles and Responsibilities A clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is essential to the success of any safety policy. Hierarchy of Responsibilities: Senior management is typically responsible for setting the safety policy and allocating resources, while supervisors ensure compliance on a day-to-day basis. Employees are responsible for following safety guidelines and reporting hazards.Clear Accountability: Each role should have clearly defined responsibilities to ensure accountability. For example, the safety officer might be responsible for conducting regular safety audits, while employees might be responsible for attending mandatory safety training.Example: In a hospital, the safety officer might be responsible for conducting regular safety audits, while nursing staff are tasked with maintaining hygiene standards to prevent the spread of infections.Communication and TrainingEffective communication and ongoing training are critical components of an effective safety policy.
 
 Clear communication ensures that all employees are aware of safety protocols, while regular training reinforces these practices and keeps safety at the forefront of daily operations.  Effective Communication
Training Programs
Methods: Communication methods may include safety briefings, email updates, bulletin boards, and digital platforms. The key is to ensure that all employees, regardless of their role or location, receive and understand the safety policy.


Feedback Loops: Employees should be encouraged to provide feedback on the safety policy and report any issues. This can be done through suggestion boxes, safety committees, or regular meetings.
Internal and External StakeholdersAn effective safety policy requires the active involvement of both internal and external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders, including employees and management, play a direct role in implementing and upholding safety standards.Internal Stakeholders
External Stakeholders
Who They Are: Employees, management, safety officers, and internal safety committees are considered internal stakeholders. Their buy-in is essential for the effective implementation of the safety policy.

Their Role: Internal stakeholders are directly involved in the day-to-day application of the safety policy. They are responsible for following the guidelines and contributing to a safe working environmentInvolvement of Management and EmployeesIn the process of writing a safety policy, the involvement of both management and employees is essential to ensure its effectiveness.Management Commitment Leadership Buy-In: The success of any safety policy begins with the commitment of top management. Without their visible support and active participation, the policy may fail to gain the necessary traction across the organisation. Leaders must not only endorse the policy but also model the behaviour it advocates. Their buy-in signals to all employees that safety is a priority. It also fosters a culture of accountability, where safety is everyone’s responsibility.Resource Allocation: Management's role doesn't stop at endorsing the policy; they must also provide the necessary resources to make it work. This includes budgeting for safety training, purchasing appropriate safety equipment, and ensuring that there is adequate staffing to manage safety initiatives. For example, allocating funds for new personal protective equipment (PPE) or investing in comprehensive safety training programmes ensures that employees have the tools and knowledge to work safely. Without these resources, even the best-written policy could fail in practicInvolvement of Management and Employees ContinuedThis approach not only solidifies the importance of collaborative efforts in writing a safety policy but also equips participants with the skills and perspectives needed to engage effectively with all stakeholders in the organisations.Employee Engagement:Empowerment: Employees are the frontline of safety and should be empowered to contribute actively to the safety culture. This can be done by involving them in safety committees, where they can voice their concerns and suggest improvements. Encouraging employees to report hazards without fear of retaliation is also crucial. When employees are empowered, they are more likely to take ownership of safety, leading to a more proactive approach to hazard identification and risk management.Incentives: To further motivate employees, some organisations implement safety incentive programmes. These programmes reward employees for identifying safety improvements or maintaining a certain number of accident-free days. Incentives can range from recognition in meetings to financial rewards or extra time off. Such programmes not only enhance safety but aConsultation and Collaboration ProcessesEngaging stakeholders ensures that the policy is not only comprehensive but also practical and aligned with the needs of the organisation.ConsultationGathering Input: Consultation is the process of seeking feedback and input from relevant stakeholders during the formulation of the safety policy. This can be achieved through various methods such as surveys, focus groups, or formal meetings. The primary goal of consultation is to ensure that the safety policy reflects the perspectives, concerns, and requirements of all stakeholders involved. By gathering input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including employees, management, and external experts, the policy is more likely to be effective and widely accepted.lso boost morale by recognising the contributions of employees to the overLesson SummaryRoles and responsibilities must be clearly defined within the policy. Management is accountable for setting the policy and allocating resources, while employees must follow safety guidelines and report hazards.Effective communication and training are key to ensuring all employees understand the safety policy. Regular training and feedback loops help reinforce safety procedures and encourage continuous improvement.Stakeholders, both internal (employees, safety officers) and external (regulatory bodies, contractors), play an essential role in the effective implementation of a safety policy.The involvement of both management and employees in creating and maintaining the policy ensures its success. Management commitment and employee engagement foster a proactive safety culture.Consultation and collaboration between departments and stakeholders during policy development ensure the policy is comprehensive, relevant, and widely accepted across the organisation.Lesson SummaryA safety policy is a formal written statement that outlines an organisation’s commitment to maintaining a safe working environment. It establishes guidelines for managing health and safety and defines the roles of management, employees, and stakeholders.The safety policy plays a central role in risk management, ensuring organisational consistency in safety practices and promoting continuous improvement as new risks and safety measures are identified.Legal and regulatory compliance is essential. Organisations must adhere to relevant laws like the UK Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and international standards such as ISO 45001 to avoid legal penalties and ensure a safer working environment.A strong safety culture is cultivated when leaders promote and model adherence to the safety policy. This leadership fosters a workplace where employees take proactive steps to ensure their own and others' safety.The policy should include clear health and safety objectives, aligned with broader business goals, and use the SMART framework to make objectives specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bounLearning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:Analyse the organisation's needs by conducting a comprehensive safety audit.Categorise specific risks and hazards that need to be addressed in the safety policy.Create clear and concise statements that articulate the policy’s purpose and objectives.Outline essential elements of the safety policy, including scope, objectives, and roles.Classify the safety policy content to fit different departments and operations.Evaluate relevant laws and regulations to ensure the policy complies with legal standards.Compare the safety policy with industry standards to incorporate best practices.Review the policy structure to include all necessary legal requirements.dAssessing Organisational NeedsA safety audit is a systematic examination of an organisation's safety policies, practices, and procedures. It aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the current safety framework. A comprehensive audit involves planning, data collection, analysis, and reporting to ensure that safety protocols are effective and compliant with applicable laws.Process of Conducting a Safety AuditPlanning the Audit: The audit should begin with a clear plan outlining the scope, objectives, and criteria for evaluation. It should also define the roles and responsibilities of the audit team.Data Collection: The audit involves gathering data through observations, interviews, inspections, and document reviews. This data helps assess whether the organisation is complying with its safety policy and relevant regulations.Analysis and Reporting: After data collection, the audit team analyses the findings to identify gaps or areas of non-compliance. A report is then prepared, outlining the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for improvement.Identifying Specific Risks and HazardsAfter completing the safety audit, the subsequent step is to pinpoint specific risks and hazards within the organisation. This requires evaluating both physical hazards as well as non-physical hazards.Hazard Identification ProcessRisk Assessment
Risk Prioritisation
Aligning With Organisational GoalsSafety policies should align with the broader objectives of the organisation. By integrating safety goals into the overall business strategy, organisations can ensure that safety is not viewed as a standalone concern but as an essential element of operational excellence.Integration With Business ObjectivesStrategic Alignment: The safety policy should be aligned with the overall goals and mission of the organisation. For example, if a company’s goal is to achieve operational excellence, the safety policy should emphasise efficient and safe work practices.Sustainability and Safety: Organisations focused on sustainability can align their safety policies with environmental goals, such as reducing workplace incidents that lead to environmental damage.Risk Assessment follows right after conducting a safety audit, this step is to identify specific risks and hazards within the organisation. This involves assessing both physical hazards (e.g., machinery, chemicals) and non-physical hazards (e.g., ergonomic issues, stress).
Writing Clear and Concise StatementsA well-written safety policy should be clear, concise, and easily understood by all employees. Avoid jargon and complex language to ensure that everyone, regardless of their role or education, can comprehend the policy's intent and requirements.Clarity and PrecisionSimplicity: The safety policy should be written in clear and concise language that is easily understood by all employees, regardless of their level of education or experience. Avoid jargon and complex sentences.Directness: Statements should be direct and to the point, outlining specific actions, responsibilities, and expectations. For example, instead of saying “Employees are encouraged to report hazards,” the policy should state “Employees must report any hazards immediately to their supervisor.Including Essential Elements (Scope, Objectives, Roles)A comprehensive safety policy should include essential elements such as:Scope
Objectives
Roles
 The scope of the safety policy should clearly outline the areas of the organisation it applies to, including specific departments, activities, and employee groups. This ensures that everyone knows the extent of the policy’s application.Tailoring the Policy to Different DepartmentsEach department in an organisation encounters unique safety challenges based on the nature of its work. To ensure the safety policy is effective, it must be customised to meet the specific needs of each department while maintaining a unified approach throughout the organisation. This tailored approach ensures that all employees are protected according to the particular risks they face, without compromising the overall consistency and coherence of the policy. By doing so, the organisation fosters a safety culture that is both adaptable and comprehensive.Customisation:Departmental Differences: Different departments within an organisation may have unique safety challenges and requirements. The safety policy should be tailored to address these specific needs while maintaining overall consistency across the organisation.Operational Fit: The policy should also consider the specific operations of the organisation. For instance, a manufacturing plant will have different safety needs compared to an office environment.Understanding Relevant Laws and RegulationsSafety policies must comply with local, national, and international laws and regulations. Understanding these legal requirements is essential to ensure that the safety policy is effective and protects the organisation from legal liabilities.Industry-Specific Laws: Depending on the industry, organisations must comply with various health and safety laws and regulations. Understanding these legal requirements is essential for developing a compliant safety policy.International Standards: In addition to local laws, organisations that operate globally must be aware of international standards like ISO 45001, which governs occupational health and safety management systems.Ensuring Compliance With Industry StandardsIn addition to legal requirements, organisations should benchmark their safety policies against industry standards which helps prevent legal issues and improves overall safety performance.Benchmarking: Organisations should benchmark their safety policies against industry standards to ensure they meet or exceed minimum requirements. This can help prevent legal issues and improve safety performance.Regular Updates: Safety policies should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and industry standards.Lesson SummaryA safety audit is critical for assessing current safety practices, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.The identification of hazards involves assessing both physical and non-physical risks, prioritising them based on impact and likelihood, and addressing high-priority risks first.The safety policy must be aligned with the organisation's business objectives, such as operational efficiency, sustainability, and innovation, ensuring that it supports overall business goals.Clear and concise language is vital. The safety policy should be simple and direct, outlining specific actions, roles, and expectations in terms that are easily understood by all employees.It is essential to include key components such as the scope, objectives, and roles and responsibilities for management, supervisors, and employees to ensure accountability.The safety policy should be customised to fit different departments and operations, reflecting the unique risks of each area while maintaining consistency across the organisation.Legal compliance is a cornerstone of any safety policy. Organisations must ensure that the policy incorporates relevant industry laws and international standards and that it is regularly updated to reflect changes in regulations.The enforcement of the policy should be clearly outlined, ensuring that non-compliance has defined consequences and that there is accountability at all levels of the organisation.Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module you will be able to:Analyse effective communication strategies for implementing the Safety Policy.Apply training programs and workshops to ensure understanding and buy-in from all levels.Assess understanding and engagement with the Safety Policy through communication and training efforts.Define monitoring mechanisms to track the implementation and effectiveness of the policy.Outline reporting procedures and accountability measures for handling policy enforcement.Discuss non-compliance issues and appropriate disciplinary actions.Review regular cycles and triggers for updating the Safety Policy.Create feedback and focus on continuous improvement during policy reviews.Adapt the safety policy to changes in regulations and evolving workplace conditions.Illustrate the process for communicating policy updates and changes to stakeholders.Discuss methods for monitoring policy implementation and ensuring ongoing effectiveness.Evaluate the overall impact of the Safety Policy on workplace safety and compliance.Communicating the Safety PolicyCommunicating the safety policy effectively is crucial to its successful implementation. The policy must be clearly conveyed to all employees, from top management to frontline workers, ensuring everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a safe workplace.
 
 In order to achieve clear messaging in a safety policy the following must be considered:Target Audience: The safety policy must be communicated effectively to all employees, from top management to frontline workers. Different communication methods may be needed depending on the audience, such as formal presentations for management and hands-on demonstrations for operational staff.Simplicity: The policy should be communicated in clear, simple language to ensure that all employees understand it, regardless of their role or educational background. Avoid technical jargon that might confuse or alienate some employees.Methods of CommunicationEffective communication is essential to ensure that all employees understand and adhere to the safety policy. Various methods of communication can be used to reach different groups within the organisation, including written communications, visual aids, and regular meetings. Each method plays a vital role in reinforcing key safety messages, ensuring clarity, and fostering engagement, allowing employees to ask questions and provide feedback on safety procedures.Written Communications
Visual Aids
Meetings and Briefings
 Use memos, emails, and posters to communicate key aspects of the safety policy. Ensure that these written communications are accessible to all employee

They are essential for ensuring that the reader understands the technical information being presented.In order to be technically accurate, definitions need to be: 
Clear, Concise and Accurate.They should also be written in a way that is easy to understand for a non-technical audience.Technical definitions can be used in a variety of technical documents, such as user manuals, technical reports, and product specifications. For example, a technical definition of a computer's hard drive might be "a device used for storing and retrieving digital information on a computer."The Elements of Technical Writing - 032. Technical DescriptionsTechnical descriptions are used to describe technical products, processes, or systems. They are essential for providing the reader with a clear understanding of how something works. Technical descriptions should be written in a way that is easy to understand for a non-technical audience. They should also be accurate and detailed.
In user manuals, technical reports, and product specifications, technical descriptions can be used. For example, a technical description of a computer's operating system might be "a software program that manages the computer's hardwareThe Elements of Technical Writing - 04 In conclusion, technical writing is a specialized form of writing that requires a unique set of skills. Technical writers must be able to communicate complex technical information in a clear and concise manner. 
The three basic elements of technical writing are technical definitions, technical descriptions, and technical instructions. Technical writers must be able to use these elements effectively to create documents that are accurate, informative, and easy to understand for a non-technical audience. and software resources and provides common services for computer programs."3. Technical InstructionsUser ManualA user manual is a document that provides instructions and guidance on how to use a product or service. It is an essential component of technical writing, as it helps users understand and operate complex technology that they may not be able to use intuitively.User manuals are typically written for novice or intermediate users, but they may also include information for experts.1. Write Consistently for Your Audience2.Include Index & Symbols 3. Use Visuals4. Have The Manual ReviewedBefore you begin writing your user manual, it is important to identify your audience. Will you be writing for novice users, intermediate users, or experts? Depending on your audience, you will need to make decisions about which details to include, what level of technical vocabulary to use, and whether to include a summary list of steps.

Most imporantly, use a consistent format for each part of the manual, including headings, subheadings, goals, actions, responses, cautions, warnings, and tips. This will help users navigate the manual and find the information they need quickly and easily.What Makes Writing Technical?Technical writing is a form of communication that aims to help readers understand and use complex technology that cannot be used intuitively. It is a type of writing that is used to convey technical information to a specific audience, such as users of a particular technology or stakeholders who need to be informed about its functioning or usage. Technical writing produces long-form texts that are well-organized and clearly structured, with a super-neutral tonality that makes the text easy to understand.Important Key characteristics of technical writing:Accuracy and PrecisionEmphasis on Usability Technical writers must be able to convey complex information in a way that is clear and concise without sacrificing accuracy. They must also be able to use technical terminology and jargon correctly while still making the text accessible to readers who may not be familiar with the subject matter.What Makes Writing Technical? - 02Technical Writing can take many different forms, including user manuals, technical reports, white papers, and online help systems. It can encompass a wide range of subject matter, from software and hardware to engineering and science. Regardless of the specific form or subject matter, however, technical writing always has the same goal: 


To help readers understand and use complex technology in a safe and effective manner.Structure in Technical WritingStructure is a crucial aspect of technical writing. It refers to the way in which information is organized and presented in a document. A well-structured technical document is easy to read and understand, and it helps readers quickly find the information they need. In this section, we will discuss the importance of structure in technical writing and how it can help you to create effective and user-friendly documents.Sensible InformationStructure helps to ensure that your document is organized in a logical and coherent manner. This means that the information is presented in a way that makes sense to the reader and that the document flows smoothly from one section to the next. A well-structured document will have clear headings and subheadings, which help to guide the reader through the content and make it easier to navigate.Readable WritingStep 01: PreparationThe technical writing process is a structured approach to creating technical documents that are accurate, clear, and easy to understand. 
In this section, we will discuss the first step of the process, which is preparation.Preparation is a critical step in the technical writing process, as it sets the foundation for the rest of the document. During this step, the technical writer must identify the purpose of the document, the target audience, and the scope of the project. This information will help to guide the rest of the writing process and ensure that the document meets the needs of its intended audience.Let's have a look at the most crucial aspects of this step below.An analysis of the target audience's characteristicsThe Purpose of The DocumentUsing Characterization as an Example The technical writer must identify who the document is intended for, and what their needs and expectations are. This information will help to guide the tone, style, and level of detail in the document. Step 01: Preparation - 02Finally, during the preparation stage, the writer must identify the scope of the project. This includes determining the following:The length of the document, The level of detail required, and,Any constraints or limitations that may impact the wLayouts Are ImportantLayouts play a crucial role in technical writing as they help to organize information in a clear and concise manner. A well-designed layout can make a technical document more accessible and easier to understand for the reader. Technical writing is all about communicating complex information in a simple and straightforward way, and a good layout can help achieve this goal.One of the key benefits of a good layout is that it can help to break up large blocks of text into smaller, more manageable sections. This can make it easier for the reader to scan the document and find the information they need quickly.Headings and subheadings can be used to create a clear hierarchy of information, with the most important information presented first. Bullet points and numbered lists can also be used to highlight key points and make the information more digestible.Another important aspect of layout design is the use of white space. White space refers to the empty space around text and images on a page. By using white space effectively, a technical writer can create a more visually appealing document that is easier to read. White space can be used to separate different sections of the document, draw attention to important information, and create a sense of balance and harmony on the page.riting process.Layouts Are Important - 02In addition to making a document more readable, a good layout can also help to reinforce the message of the document. 
For example, if a technical document is about a new product, the layout can be designed to showcase the product and its features. This can help to create a more engaging and persuasive document that is more likely to be read and understood by the target audience. Finally, a well-designed layout can help to establish the credibility of the technical writer and the organization they represent. A professional-looking document with a clear and consistent layout can help to create a positive impression on the reader and make them more likely to trust the information presented.Specific Design Guidelines Here, we will share some design guidelines to meet the needs of People with Disabilities. Please take note as you must follow these guidelines in your writing. Use appropriate color contrast: Use appropriate color contrast to ensure that the website is accessible to people with visual impairments. Use colors that are easy to distinguish from each other, and avoid using color alone to convey information.Use appropriate alt text: Use appropriate alt text to describe images and other non-text content. This will ensure that the website is accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers.

Use appropriate headings: Use appropriate headings to structure the content of the website. This will ensure that the website is accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers.
Use appropriate language: Use appropriate language that is easy to understand and that is free from jargon and technical terms. This will ensure that the website is accessible to people with cognitive impairments.
Ensure that the website is keyboard accessible: Ensure that the website is keyboard accessible by providing keyboard shortcuts and ensuring that all functionality can be accessed using the keyboard alone. This wiLesson SummaryLet's quickly revisit what we have learned in this module. In this module, we have learned: Technical writers should use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to make the document easy to read and understand.Technical writers are responsible for creating a variety of documents, including user manuals, technical reports, product specifications, and training materials.Proposals are used to persuade someone to take a specific action, such as funding a project or purchasing a product.Formal reports are used to communicate research findings and technical information to a specific audience.Spec sheets should be organized in a clear and logical manner, with headings and subheadings that make it easy for readers to find the information they need.Questionnaires are a type of survey used in technical writing to gather information from a specific audience.Lesson SummaryOne of the key aspects of preparation is the characterization of the target audience.During the research and information-collecting stage, the technical writer must also ensure that the information is accurate and complete.During the writing stage, the technical writer must also ensure that the document is written in a way that is appropriate for its intended audience.A well-designed layout can help to establish the credibility of the technical writer and the organization they represent.Forms are an important part of technical writing, as they allow readers to provide information in a structured and organized way.Headers and footers are an important part of technical writing, as they provide readers with important information about the document they are reading.earning OutcomesHaving completed this module, you will be able to:Describe the proper usage of parts of speech, abbreviations, and capitalization.Explain the rules for handling numbers and punctuation in technical content.Recognize objectivity, formality, and appropriate terminology in technical content.Apply guidelines for publishing in technical journals.List a step-by-step process for filing a patent.Identify the essentials for creating a successful proposaUnderstanding Sentence RequirementsIn technical writing, it's important to understand the requirements of a sentence to ensure that it is clear, concise, and effective in conveying information. Here are some guidelines for understanding sentence requirements in technical writing:Identify the subject and verb: Identify the subject and verb of the sentence to ensure that the sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is the person or thing that performs the action, and the verb is the action being performed.
Use proper sentence structure: Use proper sentence structure to ensure that the sentence is clear and easy to understand. A sentence should have a subject, verb, and object and should be written in a logical order.Use appropriate punctuation: Use appropriate punctuation to clarify the meaning of the sentence. For example, use commas to separate items in a list or to set off nonessential information.
Avoid sentence fragments: Avoid sentence fragments, which are incomplete sentences that do not contain a subject or verb. Sentence fragments can be confusing and difficult to understand.

Use parallel structure: Use parallel structure to make the sentence easier to read and understand. Parallel structure means using the same grammatical structure for similar ideas in a sentence.
Use appropriate sentence length: Use appropriate sentence length to ensure that the sentence is easy to read and understand. Long, complex sentences can be difficult to follow.Technical Writing StyleThe goal of technical writing is to enable readers to use technology or understand a process or concept. Because the subject matter is more important than the writer’s voice, technical writing style uses an objective, not a subjective, tone.Here are some key characteristics of technical writing style:Clarity: Technical writing style uses clear and concise language that is easy for readers to understand. Technical writers avoid using complex vocabulary and technical jargon that may be difficult for non-experts to understand.Directness: Technical writing should be direct and to the point. Technical writers use short sentences and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.Objectivity: Technical writing style uses an objective tone, focusing on the facts rather than the writer's opinions or feelings. Technical writers avoid using emotional language or persuasive techniques.Accuracy: Technical writers ensure that their writing is factually correct, precise and free from errors.Visuals: Technical writing often uses visuals such as diagrams, charts, and graphs to help readers understand complex information. These visuals should be clear and easy to read and should be placed where they would most benefit readers.Clarity in Technical Writing Clarity is essential to effective communication in technical writing. Without clarity, readers may misunderstand the information presented in the document, which can lead to errors and confusion. Achieving clarity in technical writing requires a focus on two key elements: sentence structure and language.1. Sentence Structure2. LanguageTechnical writers should use short, simple sentences that are easy for readers to understand. Long, complex sentences can be difficult to follow and may lead to confusion. Technical writers should also use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to read.Technical writers should use concrete language and avoid using vague or general terms. They should also define any technical terms or acronyms used in the document to ensure that readers understand their meaning.Conciseness Conciseness is a key element of effective technical writing. It means that extraneous words, phrases, clauses, and sentences have been removed from writing without sacrificing clarity or appropriate detail.Conciseness is important in technical writing because it helps to ensure that the information presented is clear and easy to understand. By eliminating unnecessary words and phrases, technical writers can focus on the main message and avoid confusing readers with extraneous information.Concise writing is also more efficient, as it allows readers to quickly find the information they need without having to wade through unnecessary text. 

Overall, conciseness is an essential element of effective technical writing that helps to ensure that the information presented is clear, concise, and easy to understand.Tips for Writing ConciselyTo write concisely in technical writing, it is important to focus on the main message and avoid unnecessary information.The following tips will help you write concisely:
Use short, simple sentences that are easy to understand.
Avoid using technical jargon and complex vocabulary that may be difficult for non-experts to understand.
Use active voice instead of passive voice to make your writing more direct and concise.
Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases, such as adjectives and adverbs, that do not add meaning to your writing.
Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to read.Objective WritingObjective writing means presenting information without actively convincing the reader of something or eliciting a particular response. To write objectively in technical writing, it is important to focus on the facts rather than the writer's opinions or feelings.In technical writing, objectivity is important to ensure that the information presented is accurate, informative, and free of bias. By presenting verifiable facts and avoiding emotional language or persuasive techniques, technical writers can create documents that are objective and informative. 
Objective writing also helps to build trust with readers, as it shows that the writer is focused on presenting information rather than promoting a particular point of view. Overall, objective writing is an essential element of effective technical writing that helps to ensure that the information presented is accurate, informative, and free from bias. Biased LanguageBiased language can be a barrier to effective communication in technical writing. It can reveal the writer's point of view, making it weighted and subjective. To avoid biased language in technical writing, it is important to use language that is neutral and free from stereotypes or assumptions. Here are some tips to help you avoid biased language:Use gender-neutral language, such as "they" instead of "he" or "she."
Avoid using language that assumes a particular race, ethnicity, or nationality.
Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals and groups.
Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to any group.
Use language that is appropriate for the intended audience.Formality - 01  What is formality in technical writing?
Formality in technical writing refers to the level of language and detail used in a document. It is determined by the intended audience and the purpose of the document. 
Formality can range from the highly technical language used in academic papers to the more accessible language used in instructional manuals. The level of formality used in technical writing can affect how the document is perceived by the reader and how well it is understood. It isChoosing The Right Level of FormalityChoosing the right level of formality in technical writing depends on several factors, including the intended audience, the purpose of the document, and the level of knowledge the audience has about the topic. Here are some tips to help you choose the right level of formality: Consider the AudienceConsider Document's PurposeConsider Audience KnowledgeThe level of formality should be appropriate for the intended audience. If the audience is highly technical, a more formal level of language may be appropriate. If the audience is less technical, a more accessible level of language may be more appropriate.Pitfalls in Technical WritingThere are several pitfalls that can occur in technical writing, which can lead to confusion, errors, and a negative impression of the audience. Some common pitfalls include:Poorly defined purpose: If the purpose of the document is not clearly defined, it can be difficult to create content that meets the needs of the audience.
Broad audience definition: Defining the audience too broadly can make it difficult to create content that is relevant and useful to the specific needs of the audience.
Overuse of jargon: Using too much technical jargon can make the writing difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the field.
Lack of organization: Poor organization can make it difficult for the audience to follow the flow of the document and find the information they need.
Inaccurate or incomplete information: Technical writing must be accurate and complete to be useful to the audience.How to Avoid Pitfalls in Writing?To avoid pitfalls in technical writing, it is important to follow these guidelines:Define the purpose of the document clearly and specifically.
Define the audience of the document clearly and specifically.
Use technical jargon sparingly and provide definitions or explanations when necessary.
Organize the document in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.
Ensure that all information presented is accurate and complete.
Use clear, concise language that accurately conveys the intended message.What Makes a Good Technical Writer?A good technical writer is someone who can communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner. They have a strong understanding of the subject matter they are writing about and are able to translate technical jargon into language that is easy for non-experts to understand. In addition to technical knowledge, a good technical writer also possesses strong writing and editing skills, as well as the ability to work collaboratively with others.Here are some key qualities that make a good technical writer:1. Strong Writing Skills2. Technical Knowledge3. Attention to Detail4. Collaboration SkillsA good technical writer is able to write clearly and concisely, using language that is appropriate for the intended audience. They are able to organize information in a logical and easy-to-follow manner and are able to use visuals such as diagrams and charts to help readers understand complex information.The Importance of NumbersNumbers are an important aspect of technical writing, and it's important to use them correctly to ensure clarity and accuracy. Here are some rules and best practices for using numbers in technical writing:Spell out small numbers: Spell out numbers from one to nine, and use numerals for numbers 10 and above. For example, "three apples" or "15 computers."
Use numerals for measurements: Use numerals for measurements, such as distances, weights, and temperatures. For example, "5 miles" or "10 degrees Celsius."Use numerals for percentages: Use numerals for percentages, such as "25%."
Use commas for large numbers: Use commas to separate groups of three digits in large numbers. For example, "1,000" or "10,000,000."
Use consistent units of measurement: Use consistent units of measurement throughout the document. For example, if you use "miles" to measure distance, use "pounds" to measure weight.Punctuation RulesPunctuation is an essential aspect of technical writing that can affect the clarity and professionalism of a document. Here are some rules and best practices for using punctuation in technical writing:Use periods: Use periods to end sentences and abbreviations. For example, "The meeting will be held at 2 p.m." or "NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration."Use commas: Use commas to separate items in a list, to separate clauses in a sentence, and to set off introductory phrases. For example, "The project requires a computer, printer, and scanner," or "After the meeting, we will discuss the budget."
Use semicolons: Use semicolons to separate two independent clauses that are closely related. For example, "The project is due next week; we need to work overtime to finish it."
Use colons: Use colons to introduce a list, to introduce a quotation, or to separate two independent clauses where the second clause explains or elaborates on the first. For example, "The presentation will cover the following topics: project goals, timeline, and budget," or "The CEO said: 'We need to increase our sales by 20% this quarter.'"Gender in Technical Writing In technical writing, it's important to be mindful of gender distinctions when referring to people or objects. Here are some guidelines for assigning gender in technical writing: Use gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language whenever possible to avoid excluding or offending any gender. For example, use "they" instead of "he" or "she" when referring to a person whose gender is unknown.
Use gender-specific language when necessary: Use gender-specific language when necessary to accurately describe a person or object. For example, use "actress" instead of "actor" when referring to a female performer.
Avoid using gender stereotypes: Avoid using gender stereotypes when describing people or objects. For example, avoid using "manly" to describe a product that is strong or durable.
Be consistent: Be consistent in your use of gender-specific language. For example, if you use "actor" to refer to a male performer, use "actress" to refer to a female performer.Voice in Technical Writing Voice refers to the relationship between the subject of a sentence and the action being performed. In technical writing, it's important to use the appropriate voice to convey information accurately and effectively. Here are some guidelines for using voice in technical writing: Use Active VoiceUse Passive Voice When NecessaryAvoid Using the Passive Voice Excessively
Use active voice whenever possible to make the writing more concise and direct. In active voice, the subject performs the action. For example, "The engineer designed the bridge" is in active voice.Mood in Technical Writing Mood refers to the attitude or feeling conveyed by a sentence. In technical writing, it's important to use the appropriate mood to convey information accurately and effectively. 


Here are some guidelines for using mood in technical writing:Use indicative mood: Use indicative mood to state facts or make statements. For example, "The experiment showed that the hypothesis was correct" is an indicative mood.
Use imperative mood: Use imperative mood to give commands or make requests. For example, "Please submit your report by Friday" is in imperative mood.
Use subjunctive mood when necessary: Use subjunctive.

About the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam
1.  The CKA program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in collaboration with the Linux Foundation to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem.
2.  The purpose of the CKA programme is to assure that administrators have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators.
3.  It is recommended that you refer to the Kubernetes.io documentation many times before taking the exam.
The CKA exam domain:     ●  Cluster architecture, installation and configuration (25%)      ●  Storage (10%)
●  Workloads and scheduling (15%)            ●  Services and networking  (20%)                     ●  Troubleshooting (30%)Containers: Containers are used to package applications in a standardised manner.
Containers maintain standards around portability, separation of concerns, and standardised packaging.
Kubernetes: It can be described as a container orchestration tool that can be run on Linux and Windows servers. It is a free and open-source project that supports native cloud applications. Kubernetes has many components, and those components all interact with each other through the API server.
Docker: It is a containerization platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all the required components, such as libraries and other dependencies and deploy it as one package.KubernetesRecall the command syntax and procedures for running a deploymentLearning OutcomesAfter completing this module, you will be able to:Identify the storage options, configuration, and storage resources for Kubernetes

Configuring storage
Kubernetes storage options:  ● Volumes    ● Persistent volumes    ● Persistent volume claims   ● Storage classes
Volume types:                           ● emptyDir   ● hostPath                    ● PersistentVolumeClaim      ● ConfigMap/SecretConfigure persistent volumes - The flow process for making a persistent volume claim: 
Create storage resource --> Define a persistent volume (PV) for API --> Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) -->
K*8s binds PVC to the PV --> Define pod volume that refers to PVC.Networking 
1.  The networking model of Kubernetes dictates that pods must be reachable by their IP address across nodes.
2.  A pause container holds the network namespace for the pod. Kubernetes creates pod containers to acquire the IP address of the pod and also sets up the network namespace for all other containers that join that pod.Understanding services - Services can be defined in different ways, which include:
●  ClusterIP           ●  NodePort             ●  LoadBalancer              ●  An external name.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Define machine learning.Explain feature scaling and data cleaning.Outline feature engineering.Discuss linear and logistic regression.Recall regression and correlation methods. Describe linear regression implementatioLesson SummaryMachine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
There are 2 types of machine learning:Supervised machine learning Unsupervised machine learning A model is the representation of some phenomenon. For example, there are basically 2 types of math/stats models:Deterministic models (no randomness)Probabilistic models (with randomness) Deterministic models hypothesize exact relationships. They are suitable when prediction error is negligible.n.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Distinguish between parametric and non-parametric models.Discuss the exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset.Explain how to implement the KNN algorithm. Outline the KNN hyperparameter tuning. Recall the decision boundary visualization. List the pros and cons of the KNN. Lesson SummaryIn a parametric model, you know which model exactly you will fit to the data. In a non-parametric model, the data tells you what the regression should look like. 
There are four (4) attributes for the Iris dataset, these include:Sepal length in cmSepal width in cmPetal length in cmPetal width in cm The Iris dataset is very classic. It is also a straightforward multi-class classification dataset. 
The main KNN Algorithm steps include:Calculating the distance between all the training data and the test point.Finding the nearest K neighbours by sorting these pairwise distances.Classifying the point based on a majority vote.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Contrast categorical variables to numerical variables.Define entropy and information gain.Explain decision trees and implementation.Summarize the evaluation of the ID3 implementation.Describe how to plot-important features.Outline the decision trees hyper-parameters.Lesson SummaryThe Gini impurity measures the frequency at which any element of the dataset will be mislabelled when randomly labelled. The Gini impurity is calculated using a specific formula.The Gini index has values inside the interval [0, 0.5], whereas the interval of Entropy is [0, 1]Entropy is more complex since it makes use of logs. So, the calculation of the Gini Index will be faster. We have already performed pre-pruning by specifying the maximum depth in our implementation, or by controlling the different hyper-parameters in Sklearn implementation, such as the min-samples-split and max-leaf-nodes. 
However, this approach is not preferred or should not be used alone because a perfect split might follow a seemingly worthless split early in the tree. Therefore, you should combined it with post-pruning, also known as cost-complexity pruning or weakest link pruning.Information gain is biased for the attribute with many outcomes. It means it prefers the attribute with a large number of distinct values.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Define ensemble learning.Explain the out-of-bag error.Outline bootstrap sampling.Discuss random forests.List the pros and cons of random forests.Contrast boosting to bagging.Lesson SummaryEnsemble learning is about combining many mediocre (weak) models in one supermodel. 

Bootstrap addresses a very famous challenge in statistics. We only have a population sample, but we want to collect information about the whole population. How to make sure that this sample represents the entire population? Is the mean of the sample a good approximation for the mean of the population? 
The basic idea of bagging is to create different models using different bootstrapped training sets and average their predictions to produce the final output of the model. Bagging improves prediction accuracy at the expense of interpretability. 
A Random forest is a slightly modified bagging algorithm. It is basically a collection of decorrelated decision trees, built as follows. For every tree:We subsample the examples with replacement bootstrapping.For each subsample, we choose attributes at random.We randomly pick features in each split.We build the tree only on these random features and with the current subsample.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Define a Support Vector Machine (SVM).Contrast SVM Hard Margin to an SVM Soft Margin.Explain the linearity and regression of SVM.Describe SVM cross-validation.Distinguish between machine learning and data standardization.List the strengths and weaknesses of the K-Means algorithmLesson SummaryBy default, Support Vector Machines (SVM) gives more weight to correct classification than margin maximization. SVM can detect outliers and ignore them. 
The Kernel function defines inner products in the transformed space. The kernel function defines similarity in the transformed space.
Evaluating K only requires ONE ADDITION and ONE EXPONENTATION more than the original dot product does. 
Gamma is a hyper-parameter that controls the distance of influence of a single training point.
Low values of gamma indicate a large similarity radius which results in more points being grouped. For high gamma values, the points need to be very close to each other to be considered in the same group (or class). Therefore, models with substantial gamma values tend to overfit.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:Outline the Principal Component Analysis (PCA).List the various drawbacks of the PCA.Recall the main applications of the PCA.Discuss the image compression.Explain data visualization.Contrast supervised learning to unsupervised learning.Lesson SummaryPCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. The goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while keeping the information loss to a minimum. 
PCA assumes that the variables are linearly correlated. If the correlation is not linear, then PCA will not be efficient. PCA performs “lossy” compression, which means that information is lost when we discard insignificant components. 
The scaling of variables can yield different results. Hence, the scaling that you use should be documented. You should not adjust scaling to match prior knowledge of data. 
Since each principal components is a linear combination of the original features, visualizations are not easy to interpret or relate to original features.Learning OutcomesHaving completed this module, you will be able to:Explain the concept of Non-symbolic machine learningDiscuss the perception learning and perceptron that linearly separatesIndicate the backpropagation with multi-layer neural networksIdentify how to compute W for hidden nodes and describe how backpropagation worksState the  examples of backpropagation calculationsOutline how to update the weight in the backpropagation algorithmDescribe the K-means clustering and list the application of machine learningLesson SummaryMachine Learning is a part of artificial intelligence mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on its own.Non-symbolic machine learning approaches rely on weights optimization or gradient descent search instead of symbolic generalisation and specialization in learning. For example, a neural network uses gradient descent search.
An artificial neuron consists of input, output and hidden layers, while an actual one has a cell nucleus, axon and dendrites.
The structures and operations of human neurons serve as the basis for artificial neural networks.
The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron model was established in 1943 as the first computational model neuron to calculate the logic function AND and OR.
Frank Rosenblatt devised a learning algorithm called perceptron as a single-layer neural network. The main parameters include input values, weights and Bias, net sum, and an activation function.
The perceptron model begins by multiplying all input values and their weights, then adds these values to create the weighted sum.
A sigmoidal function is a mathematical function with a characteristic "S" shaped curve. It transforms any value in the domain to a number between 0 and 1.Learning OutcomesDiscuss the purpose and cost of indexing a field in a table in Access.
