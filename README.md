    Developmental Trends
    Developmental trends in human beings vary in two important ways.
    Their Generality
    Sequence and Hierarchy
    1) Developmental trends differ in their generality
    Some theories or models of development boldly assert that certain changes happen to virtually every person on the planet, and often at relatively predictable points in life. 
    A theory may assert that toddlers acquire a spoken language, or that teenagers form a sense of personal identity. Individuals who do not experience these developments would be rare, though not necessarily disabled as a result. Other theories propose developmental changes that are more limited, claiming only that the changes happen to some people or only under certain conditions. 
    Example:
    Developing a female gender role does not happen to everyone, but only to the females in a population, and the details vary according to the family, community or society in which a child lives.
    To understand this point, imagine two children of about the same age who have dramatically very different childhood experiences - for example, one who grows up in poverty and another who grows up financially well-off. 
    In what sense can we say that these two children experience the same underlying developmental changes as they grow up? 
    And how much should they even be expected to do so? 
    Developmental psychology highlights the ‚Äúsameness‚Äù or common ground between these two children. As such, it serves as counterpoint to knowledge of their obvious uniqueness, and places their uniqueness in broader perspective.
    Lesson Summary
    Development refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple sources and multiple effects. The faster and simpler the change is, the more likely it is to be called ‚Äúlearning‚Äù instead of development.
    Students‚Äô development matters for teachers, but the way it matters depends partly on how schooling is organised. 
    Developmental trends in human beings vary in two important ways. Developmental trends differ in:
    1. Their generality
    2. How strictly they are sequenced and hierarchical
    In some views of development, changes are thought to happen in a specific order and to build on each other like a sort of ‚Äústaircase‚Äù model of development (Case, 1991, 1996). 
    In other views of development, change happens, but not with a sequence or end point that is uniform. This sort of change is more like a ‚Äúkaleidoscope‚Äù than a staircase (Levinson, 1990; Lewis, 1997; Harris, 2006).

        Trends in Height and Weight
        Although it may be tempting to think that physical development is the concern of physical education teachers only, it is actually a foundation for many academic tasks, e.g. it is important to know whether children can successfully manipulate a pencil or how long students can be expected to sit still without discomfort. 
        At all class levels, it is important to have a sense of students‚Äô health needs related to their age or maturity, if only to know who may become ill, and with what illness, and to know what physical activities are reasonable and needed.
        The table below shows typical height and weight for well-nourished, healthy students. The figure shows averages for several ages, but it does not show the diversity among children, e.g. at age 6, the average boy or girl is about 115cm tall, but some are 109cm and others are 125cm. Average weight at age 6 is about 20kg, but ranges between about 16kg and 24kg - about 20% variation in either direction.
        Age	Height (cm)	Weight (kg)
        2	85	7.0
        6	115	20.0
        10	135	31.0
        14	162	52.0
        18	169	60.5
        The Effects of Puberty
        A universal physical development in students is puberty, which is the set of changes in early adolescence that bring about sexual maturity.
        The changes include:
        - Internal changes in reproductive organs.
        - Outward changes such as growth of breasts in girls and the penis in boys.
        - Increases in height and weight
        Development of Motor Skills
        Students‚Äô fundamental motor skills are already developing when they begin pre-school, but are not yet perfectly coordinated. 
        Five-year-olds generally can walk satisfactorily for most school-related purposes. For some five year olds, running still looks a bit like a hurried walk, but usually it becomes more coordinated within a year or two.
        Similarly with jumping, throwing, and catching: most children can do these things, though often clumsily, by the time they start school, but improve their skills noticeably during the early school years (Payne & Isaacs, 2005). 

    Health and Illness
    By world standards, children and youth in economically developed societies tend to be remarkably healthy. Even so, much depends on precisely how well-off families are and on how much health care is available to them. 
    Children from higher-income families experience fewer serious or life-threatening illnesses than children from lower-income families. Whatever their income level, parents and teachers note that children, especially the youngest ones, get far more illnesses than adults.
    Example:
    In 2004, an American government survey estimated that children get an average of 6-10 colds per year, but adults get only about 2-4 per year (National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, 2004). 
    The difference probably exists because: 
    - Children‚Äôs immune systems are not as fully formed as adults'.
    - Children at school are continually exposed to other children.
    An indirect result of children‚Äôs frequent illnesses is that teachers also report more frequent minor illnesses than do adults in general. 
    The illnesses are not life threatening, but they are responsible for: 
    - Many lost days of school for both students and teachers.
    - Days when a student may be present physically, but functions below par while simultaneously infecting classmates. 
    In these ways, learning and teaching often suffer because health is su

        Introduction to Social Development
        Social development refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers, and family.
        It includes positive changes, such as:
         
        - How friendships develop, 

        and negative changes, such as: 

        - Aggression or bullying. 
        The social developments that are most obviously relevant to classroom life fall into three main areas:
        1. Changes in self-concept and in relationships among students and teachers
        2. Changes in basic needs or personal motives
        3. Changes in sense of rights and responsibilities
        As with cognitive development, each of these areas has a broad, well-known theory (and theorist).
        This theory provides a framework for thinking about how the area relates to teaching. 
        The table below outlines the theories and theorists referred to in this module. 
        Their theories are not the only ones related to the social development of students, and their ideas are often debated by other researchers. But their accounts do explain much about social development that is relevant to teaching and education.
        Theory	Theorist(s)
        Development of self-concept and relationships	Erik Erikson
        Development of personal motives	Abraham Maslow
        Development of ethical knowle      dge and beliefs	Lawrence Kohlberg and his critic Carol Gilligan
        Erik Erikson‚Äôs Theory
        Like Piaget, Erik Erikson developed a theory of social development that relies on stages, except that Erikson thought of stages as a series of psychological or social crises - turning points in a person‚Äôs relationships and feelings about himself or herself (Erikson, 1963, 1980).
        Each crisis consists of a dilemma or choice that carries both advantages and risks, but in which one choice or alternative is normally considered more desirable or ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. 
        How one crisis is resolved affects how later crises are resolved. The resolution also helps to create an individual‚Äôs developing personality. 
        Erikson proposed eight crises that extend from birth through old age:
        Psychosocial crisis	Approximate age	Description
        Trust and mistrust	Birth to one year	Development of trust between caregiver and child
        Autonomy and shame	Age 1 - 3	Development of control over bodily functions and activities
        Initiative and guilt	Age 3 - 6	Testing limits of self-assertion and purposefulness
        Industry and inferiority	Age 6 - 12	Development of sense of mastery and competence
        Identity and role confusion	Age 12 - 19	Development of identity and acknowledgement of identity by others
        Intimacy and isolation	Age 19 - 25	Formation of intimate relationships and commitents
        Generativity and stagnation	Age 25 - 50	Development of creative or productive activities that contribute to future generations
        Integrity and
        Crises of infants and pre-schoolers: trust, autonomy, and initiative
        Almost from the day they are born, infants face a crisis (in Erikson‚Äôs sense) about trust and mistrust. They are happiest if they can eat, sleep and excrete according to their own physiological schedules, regardless of whether their schedules are convenient for the caregiver (often the mother).
        Unfortunately, though, a young infant is in no position to control or influence a mother‚Äôs care giving or scheduling needs; so the baby faces a dilemma about how much to trust or mistrust the mother‚Äôs helpfulness. 
        It is as if the baby asks, ‚ÄúIf I demand food (or sleep or a clean diaper) now, will my mother actually be able to help me meet this need?‚Äù
        Hopefully, between the two of them, mother and child resolve this choice in favour of the baby's trust: the mother proves herself at least ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù in her attentiveness, and the baby risks trusting mother's motivation and skill at care giving.

        Abraham Maslow‚Äôs Theory
        Abraham Maslow's theory frames personal needs or motives as a hierarchy, meaning that basic or ‚Äúlower-level‚Äù needs have to be satisfied before higher-level needs become important or motivating. 
        Compared to the stage models of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy is only loosely ‚Äúdevelopmental‚Äù, in that Maslow was not concerned with tracking universal, irreversible changes across the life span.
        Maslow's stages are universal, but they are not irreversible; earlier stages sometimes reappear later in life, in which case they must be satisfied again before later stages can redevelop. 
        Like the theories of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow‚Äôs is a rather broad ‚Äústor

        Like the theories of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow‚Äôs is a rather broad ‚Äústory‚Äù, one that has less to say about the effects of a person‚Äôs culture, language, or economic level, than about what we all have in common. 
        y‚Äù, one that has less to say about the effects of a person‚Äôs culture, language, or economic level, than about what we all have in common. 
        In its original version, Maslow‚Äôs theory distinguishes two types of needs:
        ‚Ä¢ Deficit needs
        ‚Ä¢ Being needs
        The table below summarises the two levels and their sublevels. 
        Deficit Needs	Being Needs
        Physiological needs	Cognitive needs
        Safety and security needs	Aesthetic needs
        Love and belonging needs	Self-actualization needs
                                                                                                   
        Deficit needs: getting the basic necessities of life
        Deficit needs are the basic requirements of physical and emotional well-being. 
        Initially they are physiological needs, e.g. food, sleep, clothing, and the like. Without these, nothing else matters, and especially nothing very ‚Äúelevated‚Äù or self-fulfilling. A student who is not getting enough to eat is not going to feel much interest in learning. 
        Deficit needs are prior to being needs, not in the sense of happening earlier in life, but in that deficit needs must be satisfied before being needs can be addressed. 
        As pointed out, deficit needs can reappear at any age, depending on circumstances. If that happens, they must be satisfied again before a person‚Äôs attention can shift back to ‚Äúhigher‚Äù needs. 
        Among students, in fact, deficit needs are likely to return chronically to those whose families lack economic or social resources or who live with the stresses associated with poverty (Payne, 2005).

        Introduction to Moral Development
        Moral development: forming a sense of rights and responsibilities
        Morality is a system of beliefs about what is right and good compared to what is wrong or bad. Moral development refers to changes in moral beliefs as a person grows older and gains maturity. Moral beliefs are related to, but not identical with, moral behaviour: it is possible to know the right thing to do, but not actually do it. 
        It is also not the same as knowledge of social conventions, which are arbitrary customs needed for the smooth operation of society. Social conventions may have a moral element, but they have a primarily practical purpose. 
        Example:
        Conventionally, in a particular country, motor vehicles all keep to the same side of the street. The convention allows for smooth, accident-free flow of traffic. But following the convention also has a moral element, because an individual who chooses to drive on the wrong side of the street can cause injuries or even death. 
        In this sense, choosing the wrong side of the street is wrong morally, though the choice is also unconventional.
        When it comes to school, moral choices are not restricted to occasional dramatic incidents, but are woven into most aspects of classroom life.
        Example:
        Imagine a teacher teaching reading to a group, where the students are taking turns to read aloud. 
        Should the teacher give everyone the same amount of time to read, even though some might benefit from additional time? 
        Should the teacher give more time to the students who need extra help, even if doing so bores classmates and deprives others of equal shares of ‚Äúfloor time‚Äù? 
        Which option is fairer, and which is more considerate? 
        Lawrence Kohlberg‚Äôs Theory
        One of the best-known explanations of how morality of justice develops was developed by Lawrence Kohlberg and his associates (Kohlberg, Levine, & Hewer, 1983; Power, Higgins, & Kohlberg, 1991). 
        Using a stage model similar to Piaget‚Äôs, Kohlberg proposed six stages of moral development, grouped into three levels. 
        Individuals experience the stages universally and in sequence as they form beliefs about justice. He named the levels:
        1. Preconventional
        2. Conventional
        3. Postconventional
        Kohlberg's moral development - The levels and stages are summarised in the table below. 
        Moral stage	Definition of what is "good"
        Preconventional Level:	
        Stage 1: Obedience and punishment	Action that is rewarded and not punished
        Stage 2: Market exchange	Action that is agreeable to the child and child's partner
        Conventional Level:	
        Stage 3: Peer opinion	Action that wins approval from friends or peers
        Stage 4: Law and order	Action that conforms to community customs or laws
        Postconventional Level:	
        Stage 5: Social contract	Action that follows social accepted ways of making decisions
        Stage 6: Universal principles	Action that is consistent with self-chosen, general principles
        Character Education
        Character development: Integrating ethical understanding, care, and action
        The theories described so far all offer frameworks for understanding how children grow into youth and adults. 
        Those by Maslow, Kohlberg, and Gilligan are more specific than the one by Erikson in that they focus on the development of understanding about ethics. 
        From a teacher's point of view, though, the theories are all limited in two ways. 
        One problem is that they focus primarily on cognition - on what children think about ethical issues - more than on emotions and actions. 
        The other is that they say little about how to encourage ethical development. Encouragement is part of teachers' jobs, and doing it well requires understanding not only what students know about ethics, but also how they feel about it and what ethical actions they are actually prepared to take. 
        Lesson Summary
        Morality is a system of beliefs about what is right and good compared to what is wrong or bad.
        Moral development refers to changes in moral beliefs as a person grows older and gains maturity. 

        A morality of justice is about human rights or more specifically, about respect for fairness, impartiality, equality, and individuals‚Äô independence. 

        A morality of care is about human responsibilities or more specifically, about caring for others, showing consideration for individuals‚Äô needs, and interdependence among individuals. 

        One of the best-known explanations of how morality of justice develops was developed by Lawrence Kohlberg and his associates. Using a stage model similar to Piaget‚Äôs, Kohlberg proposed six stages of moral development, grouped into three levels:
        Preconventional
        Conventional
        Postconventional
        Introduction to Student Diversity
        In keeping with the general nature of developmental theory, students have been generalised in a way, referring to ‚Äúthe‚Äù child, student, or youngster; as if a single typical or average individual exists and develops through single, predictable pathways.  
        As every teacher knows, however, development is not that simple. A class of 25 or 30 students will contain 25 or 30 individuals each learning and developing along distinct pathways. 
        Why then study developmental patterns at all? 
        Underlying their obvious diversity, students indeed show important similarities. This course so far has indicated some of the similarities and how they relate to the job of teaching. 
        References to ‚Äúthe‚Äù student should not be understood, therefore, as supporting simple-minded stereotypes; they refer instead to common tendencies of real, live children and youth. 
        Individual Learning Styles
        All of us have preferred ways of learning. Teachers often refer to these differences as learning styles, though this term may imply that students are more consistent across situations than is really the case
        Example:
        One student may like to make diagrams to help remember a reading assignment, whereas another student may prefer to write a sketchy outline instead. 
        Yet in many cases, the students could in principle reverse the strategies and still learn the material: if required, the diagram-maker could take notes for a change and the note-taker could draw diagrams. 
        Both would still learn, though neither might feel as comfortable as when using the strategies that they prefer. 
        Cognitive research from the 1940s to the present has found field dependence/independence differences to be somewhat stable for any given person across situations, though not completely so (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977; Zhang & Sternberg, 2005).
        Someone who is field dependent (perceives globally or ‚Äúholistically‚Äù) in one situation, tends to a modest extent to perceive things globally or holistically in other situations. 

        Field dependence and independence can be important in understanding students because the styles affect students‚Äô behaviours and preferences in school and classrooms. 
        Field dependence
        Field independence
        Field dependent persons tend to work better in groups, it seems, and to prefer ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù fields of study like literature and history. 
        Multiple Intelligences
        For nearly a century, educators and psychologists have debated the nature of intelligence, and more specifically whether intelligence is just one broad ability or can take more than one form. 
        Many classical definitions of the concept have tended to define intelligence as a single broad ability that allows a person to solve or complete many sorts of tasks, or at least many academic tasks like reading, knowledge of vocabulary, and the solving of logical problems (Garlick, 2002). 
        There is research evidence of such a global ability, and the idea of general intelligence often fits with society‚Äôs everyday beliefs about intelligence. Partly for these reasons, an entire mini-industry has grown up around publishing tests of intelligence, academic ability, and academic achievement. 
        But there are also problems with defining intelligence as one general ability. One way of summing up the problems is to say that conceiving of intelligence as something general tends to put it beyond teachers‚Äô influence. 
        Lesson Summary
        Development and diversity have to be understood jointly, not separately. There are indeed similarities woven among the differences in students, but also differences woven among students‚Äô commonalities. 
        Field dependence and independence can be important in understanding students because the styles affect students‚Äô behaviours and preferences in school and classrooms. 

        Field dependent persons tend to work better in groups, it seems, and to prefer ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù fields of study like literature and history. 

        Field independent persons tend to work better alone and to prefer highly analytic studies like math and science. 

        Other cognitive styles are impulsivity and reflectivity. As the names imply, an impulsive cognitive style is one in which a person reacts quickly, but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is the opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer errors. 
        Gifted and Talented Students
        The idea of multiple intelligences leads to new ways of thinking about students who have special gifts and talents. 
        Traditionally, the term gifted referred only to students with unusually high verbal skills. Their skills were demonstrated especially well on standardised tests of general ability or of school achievement. 
        More recently, however, the meaning of gifted has broadened to include unusual talents in a range of activities, such as music, creative writing, or the arts (G. Davis & Rimm, 2004). 
        To indicate the change, educators often use the dual term gifted and talented
        What are students who are gifted and talented like? Generally they show some combination of the following qualities:
        They learn more quickly and independently than most students their own age.
        They often have well-developed vocabulary, and advanced reading and writing skills.
        They are very motivated, especially on tasks that are challenging or difficult.
        They hold themselves to higher than usual standards of achievement.
        Contrary to a common impression, students who are gifted or talented are not necessarily awkward socially, less healthy, or narrow in their interests-in fact, quite the contrary (Steiner & Carr, 2003). They also come from all economic and cultural groups.
        Ironically, in spite of their obvious strengths as learners, such students often do not flourish in school unless teachers can provide them with more than the challenges of the usual curriculum. 
        Example:
        A pre-school child who is precociously advanced in reading may make little further progress at reading if her teachers do not recognise and develop her skill; her talent may effectively disappear from view as her peers gradually catch up to her initial level. .
        Supporting students who are gifted and talented
        Supporting the gifted and talented usually involves a mixture of acceleration and enrichment of the usual curriculum (Schiever & Maker, 2003). Acceleration involves either a child skipping a class level, or else the teacher redesigning the curriculum within a particular class level so that more material is covered faster. 
        Either strategy works, but only up to a point: children who have skipped a class usually function well in the higher classes, both academically and socially. Unfortunately skipping classes cannot happen repeatedly unless the teacher, parents, and the student themselves are prepared to live with large age and maturity differences within single classrooms. 
        There is no guarantee that instruction in the new, higher-level classroom will be any more stimulating than it was in the former, lower-level classroom. 
        Redesigning the curriculum is also beneficial to the student, but impractical to do on a widespread basis; even if teachers had the time to redesign their programs, many non-gifted students would be left behind as a result.

        Development and diversity have to be understood jointly, not separately. There are indeed similarities woven among the differences in students, but also differences woven among students‚Äô commonalities. 
        Field dependence and independence can be important in understanding students because the styles affect students‚Äô behaviours and preferences in school and classrooms. 

        Field dependent persons tend to work better in groups, it seems, and to prefer ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù fields of study like literature and history. 

        Field independent persons tend to work better alone and to prefer highly analytic studies like math and science. 

        Other cognitive styles are impulsivity and reflectivity. As the names imply, an impulsive cognitive style is one in which a person reacts quickly, but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is the opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer errors. 
        Introduction to Gender Differences
        Gender roles are the patterns of behaviours, attitudes and expectations associated with a particular sex - with being either male or female.
        For clarity, psychologists sometimes distinguish gender differences, which are related to social roles, from sex differences, which are related only to physiology and anatomy. 
        Using this terminology, gender matters in teaching more than sex. 
        Although there are many exceptions, boys and girls do differ on average in ways that parallel conventional gender stereotypes and that affect how the sexes behave at school and in class.
        In thinking about these differences, it should be kept in mind that they refer to average trends and that there are numerous individual exceptions. 
        Every teacher knows of individual boys who are not athletic, for example, or of particular girls who are especially restless in class. 

        The individual differences mean, among other things, that it is hard to justify providing different levels of support or resources to boys than to girls for sports, athletics, or physical education. 
        The differences also suggest, though, that individual students who contradict gender stereotypes about physical abilities may benefit from emotional support or affirmation from teachers, simply because they may be less likely than usual to get such affirmation from elsewhere
        Social, Academic and Cognitive Difference in Gender Roles
        Social differences in gender roles
        Boys, when relaxing socially, more often gravitate to large groups. Whether on the playground, in a school hallway, or on the street, boys‚Äô social groups tend literally to fill up a lot of space, and often include significant amounts of roughhousing as well as organised and ‚Äúsemi-organised‚Äù competitive games or sports. 
        Girls, for their part, are more likely to seek and maintain one or two close friends and to share more intimate information and feelings with these individuals. 

        To the extent that these gender differences occur, they can make girls less visible or noticeable than boys, at least in leisure play situations where children or youth choose their companions freely. 
        Distributing praise and criticism
        In spite of most teachers‚Äô desire to be fair to all students, it turns out that they sometimes distribute praise and criticism differently to boys and girls. The differences are summarised in the table below:
        Types of response from teacher	Boys	Girls
        Praises	Correct knowledge	"Good" or compliant behaviour
        Overlooks or ignores	"Good" or compliant behaviour; Incorrect knowledge	Misbehaviour; Correct knowledge
        Critisises	Misbehaviour	Incorrect knowledge
        The tendency is to praise boys more than girls for displaying knowledge correctly, but to criticise girls more than boys for displaying knowledge incorrectly (Golombok & Fivush, 1994; Delamont, 1996). 
        Another way of stating this difference is by what teachers tend to overlook: with boys, they tend to overlook wrong answers, but with girls, they tend to overlook right answers. 

        The result (which is probably unintended) is a tendency to make boys‚Äô knowledge seem more important and boys themselves more competent. A second result is the other side of this coin: a tendency to make girls‚Äô knowledge less visible and girls themselves less competent.
        Lesson Summary
        Gender differences that affect students are related to:
        - Physical behaviours
        - Styles of social interaction
        - Academic motivations, behaviours, and choices
        Physically, boys tend to be more active than girls, and by the same token more restless if they have to sit for long periods. They are also more prone than girls to rely on physical aggression if they are frustrated.

        During the first two or three years of formal school, gross motor skills develop at almost the same average rate for boys and girls. 

        In thinking about these gender differences, it should be kept in mind that they refer to average trends and that there are numerous individual exceptions. 

        There are social, academic and cognitive differences in gender roles that affect classroom life on a day-to-day basis
        Introduction to Cultural Differences

        What is culture?
        Although sometimes the term is used to refer specifically to the artistic, intellectual and other ‚Äúhigh-brow‚Äù aspects of life, it is used here more broadly to refer to everything that characterises a way of life: 

        Football games as well as symphony concerts, and McDonald‚Äôs as well as expensive restaurants. 
        A culture is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people. 
        eachers need to understand diversity and how students‚Äô habitual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours differ from each other, and especially how they differ from the teacher‚Äôs. But this kind of understanding can get complicated. 
        To organise the topic, therefore, aspects of cultural diversity will be outlined according to how directly they relate to language differences compared to differences in other social and psychological features of culture. 
        The distinction is convenient, but it is also a bit arbitrary because the features of a culture overlap and influence each ot
        Cultural Differences in Language
        Bilingualism: language differences in the classroom
        Although monolingual speakers often do not realise it, the majority of children around the world are bilingual, meaning that they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Scotton, 2005). 
        It is therefore common for a single classroom to contain students from several language backgrounds at once. 
        Example:
        In the United States, a relatively monolingual society, more than 47 million speak a language other than English at home, and about 10 million of these people were children or youths in public schools (United States Department of Commerce, 2003). 
        The large majority of bilingual students (75%) are Hispanic, but the rest represent more than a hundred different language groups from around the world
        In classrooms as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees.
        There are students who:
        - Speak two languages fluently
        - Speak only limited versions of two languages
        - Speak their home (or heritage) language much better than the instructional language at their school, e.g. English
        - Have partially lost their heritage language in the process of learning a second language (Tse, 2001)
        It is also common for a student to speak a language satisfactorily, but be challenged by reading or writing it-though even this pattern has individual exceptions. Whatever the case, each bilingual student poses unique challenges to teachers.
        Cultural Differences in Attitudes and Beliefs
        In addition to differences in language, cultural groups tend to differ in various other attitudes and beliefs. Complete descriptions of the details of the differences have filled entire books and encyclopaedias (see for example, Birx, 2005).
        For teachers, however, one of the most important differences centres on personal beliefs about identity - the sense of self. 
        A number of other cultural beliefs and practices can be understood as resulting from how members of a culture think about personal identity.
        Example:
        In white, middle-class American culture, the self tends to be thought of as unique and independent - a unitary, living source of decisions, choices, and actions that stands (or should eventually stand) by itself (Greenfield, et al., 2003; Rogoff, 200
        Lesson Summary
        A culture is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people. 
        Ethnicity refers to the common language, history, and future experienced by a group within society. 

        Teachers need to understand diversity and how students‚Äô habitual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours differ from each other, and especially how they differ from the teacher‚Äôs.

        The majority of children around the world are bilingual, meaning that they understand and use two languages. In classrooms as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees.

        Research finds that language loss limits students‚Äô ability to learn the new language as well or as quickly as they otherwise can do. Having a large vocabulary in a first language has been shown to save time in learning vocabulary in a second language.

        Developing Quality Customer Service Skills
        Lesson Summary
        Gone are the days of traditional platforms; With digital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, websites, etc., customers can now provide reviews or feedback at any time and anywhere. 

        Quality customer service is having the ability to develop and build a good relationship with your customers.
        Customer service representatives are the face and the first impression of the organization. The quality of service delivered is a direct reflection of the organization and it is a reflection of the rep‚Äôs capabilities and skills.
        Important Skills for Customer Service are: persuasive speaking skills, empathy, adaptability, good communication skills, self-control, and effective listening.

        Apart from the listed skills, if you are responsible for communicating with clients you should always look professional whether you work in an office, hotel, restaurant, or any place else.

            Impact on Team Performance
            The practice of facilitation is one of the most misunderstood notions in the Scrum Master's responsibilities. Regardless of experience level, the art of facilitation is a critical talent that even the most seasoned Scrum Masters must constantly polish and hone. More often than not, a Scrum Master's ability to help the team as an effective facilitator can have an impact on the team's overall success.
            Facilitation is the art and craft of enabling individuals and groups to discuss issues and opportunities around a shared objective and develop agreed strategies for a common direction.


            A facilitator is a neutral individual who acts as a catalyst for groups to solve problems and produce solutions.
            Tips for Good Facilitation
            Here are some tips for good facilitation.
            Be genuine.
            To motivate the team to collaborate effectively and produce outcomes, the Scrum Master must operate with integrity and consistency, both of which are essential in developing trust within the team. Learn to be open about your strengths and faults, and you will get the respect of your peers more quickly.
            Be objective and neutral.
            Set the tone for continuous learning.
            Harness the power of collective intelligence.
            Encourage collective ownership.
            Foster focus and engagement.
            mprove Your Facilitation Skills
            A Scrum Master can use an iterative and incremental strategy to build facilitation skills, which is more likely to be effective over time. Modifications in the facilitation approach, like process changes, can be more effective and lasting when implemented with an experimental mindset.



        Key Facilitation Skills for Scrum Masters
        Do you want to be a great facilitator? If so, you'll need to learn particular skills in order to become one. Unfortunately, numerous myths about facilitation can deter you from pursuing it as a career. Some can also cause you to focus on the wrong topics, reducing the efficacy of your facilitation.
        Seven key facilitation skills have been compiled in this topic to help you become a great facilit
        Master the Facilitation Mindset
        Most facilitators struggle to master the facilitating attitude. This, in turn, has an impact on their facilitation abilities. Keep this in mind if you want to become a reliable facilitator: "be the guide, not the hero."


        Too often, facilitators believe they are superior and smarter than the teams they are guiding, which has a negative impact on how they provide assistance. Instead of assisting a group to accomplish their best job, they demonstrate their abilities by solving difficulties, which is not something a facilitator should do.
        With the correct facilitation mindset, you can become an active listener, tune into the requirements of your group, and ensure the process progresses quickly. This allows individuals to develop their own thoughts and ask questions rather than being overwhelmed by yours
        Improve Time Management
        When workshops, meetings, and training courses go on, participants lose interest. As a result, good facilitators ensure that the process moves at the appropriate pace while keeping team participation. To accomplish this, you must first understand how to properly manage time at a workshop, meeting, or training session.
        You can begin by implementing a time-boxing strategy, in which you allocate only the amount of time required to accomplish a specific action. For example, you may assign a quiz with a time limit of 15 to 20 minutes to participants. 

        When the timer goes off, the group must submit their quizzes, allowing you to go to the next step.
        Timebox for Scrum Meeting Based on Sprint Length
        Timebox for Scrum Meeting Based on Sprint Length
        Time management not only guarantees that the momentum continues throughout the workshop, but it also motivates and keeps your team motivated.
        Shortcut Circular Discussions
        Circular discussions should be avoided wherever possible. Why? Circular discussions waste time and sap your team's energy, diminishing engagement.

        A great facilitator should limit or stop circular discussions so everyone can move on. You can do this by:
            Setting the topic aside for later discussion.
            Asking participants to vote so that the majority wins and you can all move forward.
            Recording the issue to make participants feel heard. You can then go back to it later.
        Be gentle, tolerant, and thoughtful when cutting through circular discussions. The last thing you want is for your participants to feel rejected because they will never let go of the topic/issue, preventing you f
        Keep Energy Levels High
        Energy is essential in facilitating because it enhances team engagement and ensures participants do their best throughout the process. As a facilitator, you should keep the energy level in the room high at all times, especially if the workshop or meeting is lengthy and involves several steps.
        Failure to do so results in teams becoming bored, frustrated, stressed, and fatigued before the process is completed.
        To keep energy levels high, introduce physical activities such as taking a five-minute walk or clapping to keep your group focused.

        These exercises stimulate the brain while providing participants with a much-needed break from lengthy conversations and discussions.
        Limit Team Politics and Groupthink
        Meetings and workshops can easily degenerate into political debates in which the most senior or loudest participant wields all of the power and influences the other participants. 

        Finally, conversations spin out of control, and everyone has a different understanding of the process, affecting the ultimate outcome.
        Great facilitators put an end to team politics and groupthink by cultivating a collaborative environment in which everyone shares ideas, engages in debates, and brainstorms. They ensure that no participant is superior to another and put an end to lengthy off-topic arguments.
        It is crucial to recognize that handling team politics can be challenging, but by asserting authority, you can bring everyone back on course and continue the workshop or meeting
        Facilitative Listening Techniques
        Be prepared to use a variety of facilitation, conflict resolution, and interpersonal interaction approaches.
        As a Scrum Master, you must acquire the proper technique to guarantee that all members participate effectively and create group relationships, thus, increasing your personal and professional performance.
        Engaging Participants
        Here are four meeting facilitation techniques for engaging participants.
        Paraphrasing
        Bridging and referring back
        Shifting perspective
        Summarizing
        Paraphrasing implies expressing the same content as before, but in your own words, to ensure that you and the
        Make Sure Everyone is Involved
        Let's take a look at four facilitation strategies to ensure that everyone stays active throughout the meeting.
        Probing
        Redirecting questions and comments
        Giving positive reinforcements
        Including quieter members
        Probing is used to determine the mood or overall attitude of the group on a specific topic or point in the debate. Simply asking for a "thumbs up-thumbs down" poll can provide an idea of the group's general opini
        Handling Emotions
        Let's look at three techniques for dealing with participants' expressed emotions.
        Acknowledging feelings
        Validating
        Empathizing
        Acknowledging feelings raises awareness of the emotional mood. Unconscious feelings impact our communication. By paying attention to the emotional tone, providing a question that names the sentiments, and supporting the participants' responses, facilitators enhance awareness of the emotional mood.
        Agile Team Working Agreements
        Working agreements, also known as team norms, are guidelines produced by teams that outline how they must collaborate to achieve a pleasant, productive process.

        Working agreements define desirable behaviors that, while simple, are not often evident in team activities. "We all agree to engage completely" may constitute an agreement.
        Agreements are a group's power tool. Working agreement elements should be made public for easy reference throughout the collaboration process.
        The goal of establishing team norms is to create a ONE team culture that can be referred to when things get tense within the team.
        How Working Agreements Help
        Working agreements
            Develop a sense of shared responsibility
            Increase members‚Äô awareness of their own behavior
            Empower the facilitator to lead the group according to the agreements.
            Enhance the quality of the group process.
        These agreements are developed by teams, with the Scrum Master facilitating the meeting, and are ideally developed/reviewed during the Sprint 0 of each release. 
        Agreements work well when
            they are important to the team
            they are limited in number
            they are fully supported by each member
            during process inspections, members are reminded of agreements.
            the members are reminded of agreements when they are broken
            Examples of Team Working Agreements
            Some Examples of Working Agreement Guidelines are
                Show respect. Allow individuals to finish what they're saying without interfering. It is acceptable to disagree. There will be no personal assaults or attacks on concepts; we will debate ideas' merits rather than people's.
                Contribution. Everyone has an equal voice and valuable contribution.
                Meeting. Be on time, end on time, and have an agenda
                Be transparent. No hidden agenda. We will give feedback, we will receive feedback, and we will act on feedback.
                Impediments. Resolve issues inside the team. If the problem cannot be resolved inside the team, it should be assigned to the Scrum master.
                We make commitments as a team. We will be held accountable for our commitments. ‚Äì We collaborate as a team to establis
                How to Respond When They are Broken
                ivergent Vs. Convergent Thinking
                Convergent thinking focuses on reaching one, well-defined solution to a problem, while divergent thinking involves more creativity and accepts multiple solutions to a problem.
                In practice, here‚Äôs what these different types of thinking might look like:
                    Convergent thinking: If the copy machine breaks at work, a convergent thinker would call a technician right away to fix the copy machine.
                    Divergent thinking: If the copy machine breaks at work, a divergent thinker will try to determine the cause of the copy machine‚Äôs malfunction and assess various ways to fix the problem. One option may be to call a technician, while other options may include looking up a DIY video on YouTube or sending a company-wide email to see if any team members have experience with fixing copy machines. They would then determine which solution is most suitable.
                The Scrum Master is the keeper of the working agreements, but it is the obligation of the entire team to question when someone violates the agreement.

                Because the team agreed on the working agreements, the perception of personal assaults and confrontations is gone.
                Team members should evaluate the working agreements on a regular basis and ask, "Should these be updated?" in the spirit of transparency and continual progres

        Lesson Summary
            A good facilitator should be genuine, objective & neutral, create a mindset of continuous learning, harness the power of collective intelligence, foster collective ownership, and instill focus and engagement.
            Focus on 7 key facilitation skills: master the facilitation mindset, improve time management, shortcut circular discussions, keep energy levels high, curb team politics and groupthink, give clear instructions, and be flexible.
            Use facilitative listening techniques to engage participants, ensure everyone is participating, and handle emotions. Working agreements develop a sense of shared responsibility & empower the facilitator to lead the group. 
            Strategies to engage a group in divergent thinking include forming break-out groups, trying bubble maps, encouraging journaling, and trying role-playing. Engage a group in convergent thinking using grouping, outlining, or filtering.
            Keep the groan zone discomfort to a minimum by acknowledging the groan zone‚Äôs existence, chunking it down, taking breaks, and giving yourselves permission to screw up.
            Use fist of five voting, decider protocol, or the majority rule to help a group reach their Ô¨Ånal decision.
            Be aware of obstacles to effective communication: language misunderstanding, information overload, noise & distraction, lack of comprehension, status differences, and negative emotions. One good strategy is to slow down and keep it simple.
            Learning Outcomes
            Having completed this module you will be able to:
                Describe three elements of a coaching stance.
                Apply an appropriate coaching technique for two interventions.
                Analyze an intervention to identify at least two improvements.
                Explain Scrum and its benefits to a business stakeholder.
                Lesson Summary
                    The Agile coach stances are teacher, mentor, coach, and change agent.

                    As coaches, Scrum Masters foster 2-way communication by giving effective feedback, asking open-ended questions, and using nonverbal techniques.
                    Scrum Masters utilize motivational techniques, Group Coaching Techniques, and Life Coaching Techniques.
                    The GROW model (Goal, Reality, Options, Way forward) is a solid, time-tested coaching tool that can help Scrum Masters ensure efficient results for their teams.
                    Both end and performance goals need to be: SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Time-bound), PURE (Positively stated, Understood, Relevant, Ethical), and CLEAR (Challenging, Legal, Environmentally sound, Appropriate, Recorded)
                    Scrum Masters monitor, sense, and feel what is going on in the team in order to train, mentor, coach, and support the team in becoming a little bit better every day.

            Lesson Summary
                A team‚Äôs identity is shaped by answering three questions: Why do we exist‚Äîwhat is our purpose? What is important to us‚Äîwhat values do we hold dear? What do we want to achieve together?
                Successful teams are composed of members who are self-aware enough to understand their strengths, have sufficient emotional intelligence to adapt their reactions to those around them, and are intrinsically motivated to work with others to achieve things that they could not achieve on their own.
                Not everyone on a Development Team has to know how to write code, and creating a valuable ‚ÄúDone‚Äù Increment requires much more than just writing code.
                Effective self-organization requires three things: shared goals, clear accountabilities, and boundaries. If any of these weaken, the team may lose the ability to self-organize and become less effective.
                Five assets help teams reap the benefits of effective collaboration, and these build upon one another.
                If you don‚Äôt have trust, having the other four assets will be impossible. If you don‚Äôt have productive conflict, it will be impossible to have commitment, accountability, and shared goals.

                                    Lesson Summary
                                        Great servant-leaders are resourceful, enabling, tactful, respected, inspiring, nurturing, empathic, and disruptive and consider alternatives.
                                        A scrum master could be said to be successful when increments are created every Sprint, the value of increments is acceptable, the quality of Increments is improving, and team members enjoy their work. This is because they are growing, the team is committed to continuously improving every Sprint, and the team members demonstrate a solid understanding of the Scrum Framework.

                                        Choose the best approach(es) based on context: uphold Scrum, teach the Scrum framework, point north, coach, facilitate, take action or Actively do nothing. 
                                        Tips for getting the most out of regular coaching conversations include the following: Try to get out of the regular work environment, don‚Äôt always have an agenda, and celebrate successes and growth. And make time to process observations and uncover learning.
                                        Resolving Scrum conflicts is not your job. Helping them see it and choose what to do about it is. When in conflict, pay close attention to the team and consciously decide whether to intervene.

        Lesson Summary
            The Definition of Done (DoD) enforces transparency of the process, of the Increment, where we are, where we are going, and about planning a Sprint.
            The "Now, Next, Future" technique can help a team create an initial DoD and improve it over time.
            Tips for creating better Sprint Goals include avoiding compound Sprint goals, avoiding micromanagement with Sprint goals,  making the Sprint goal measurable, ensuring team consensus creating goals that achieve business impact, and making it focused on reducing risk.
            Techniques that can help you get a PBI to "Done" sooner include applying the DoD to every PBI, breaking PBIs down to smaller items trying a one-day Sprint, and including the Development Team in Product Backlog refinement.
            Scrum is not designed to help you build and release more "stuff" faster. Instead, it helps you maximize the value you create for your customers and your organization by frequently delivering a product, measuring the results, and then learning and adapting to wring more value out of the product.
            A Product Owner will foster a product mindset across the organization by creating alignment within the Development Team and among stakeholders on the direction of the product and how value is defined.
            Benefits from Product Backlog refinement activities include Increased transparency, clarification of value, breaking things into consumable pieces, reduction of dependencies, forecasting, and Incorporation of learning.
            A Product Owner ensures that there is a healthy Product Backlog of "just enough" refined work understood by the Development Team.

            Lesson Summary
            Optimising the flow of products and services as planned, sourced, made, delivered, and returned can give your business an extra competitive edge.
                Logistics management is that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and consumption to meet customers' requirements.

                Supply chain management involves the planning and managing all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities.

                The goal of supply chain management is to reduce the complexity of the supply chain, increase its flexibility and improve its efficiency and responsiveness.

                The vertical integration model is where all supply chain functions are done in-house.

                The virtual integration model involves companies working together to perform various supply chain functions.

                Outsourcing is where third-party companies provide manufacturing and distribution activities.

                Insourcing is bringing back in-house parts of the supply chain to be performed by internal employees or contractors working inside the facility.

                Offshoring refers to moving parts of a business's operations outside its native country.

                Reshoring refers to bringing operations back to the business's home country.

                A third-party logistics provider is a company that manages the logistical or operational aspects of the supply chain for another organisation.

                A fourth-party logistics provider oversees the activities of third-party logistics providers and the entire supply chain.
                Lesson Summary
                    The main supply chain drivers include production, inventory, location, information and transportation.

                    The major market types you should understand include developing, growth, steady and mature markets.

                    SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing your supply chain.

                    Severe weather events, political unrest and terrorism and increased specialization are some of the top risks that affect supply chains. We have strategies you can use to reduce the risks and impacts of these events.
                Gathering, tracking and measuring data is an essential part of measuring the success of your supply chain.
                    Some metrics that can help you evaluate the overall business health are Net Profit and Gross Profit, Collection ratio, Revenue Per Employee and others.

                    Dashboards are crucial supply chain management tools that enable you to quickly gather data on key performance indicators, evaluate it against your target and compare it with past data.

                    We looked at signs of trouble in the supply chain, such as a need for more visibility and the best practices you can adopt to address the problems.

                    The SCOR model processes involve planning, sourcing, making, delivering and returning.

                    Sustainability in the supply chain means ensuring the long-term success of the business as well as the communities that it serves.

        Physically, boys tend to be more active than girls, and by the same token more restless if they have to sit for long periods. They are also more prone than girls to rely on physical aggression if they are frustrated (Espelage & Swearer, 2004). 
        Both tendencies are inconsistent with the usual demands of classroom life, of course, and make it a little more likely that school will be a difficult experience for boys, even for boys who never actually get in trouble for being restless or aggressive.

        A child can acquire a hearing loss for a variety of reasons, ranging from disease early in childhood, to difficulties during childbirth, to reactions to toxic drugs.
        A student with hearing loss may present some of the following behaviours repeatedly (Luckner & Carter, 2001):
        - Delayed language or literacy skills, both written and oral
        - Some ability (usually partial) to read lips
        - Less worldly knowledge than usual because of lack of involvement with oral dialogue and/or delayed literacy
        - Tendency to social isolation because of awkwardness in communication
        Students with visual impairments have difficulty seeing even with corrective lenses. Most commonly the difficulty is related to refraction, tunnel vision or sensitivity to light in general. 
        Students with visual impairments often show some of the same signs as students with simple, common nearsightedness. 
        The three main strategies for teaching students with hearing loss are:
        1. Take advantage of the student‚Äôs residual hearing.
        2. Use visual cues liberally. 
        3. Include the student in the community of the classroom.

        Introduction to Student Development
        Development refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple sources and multiple effects. 
        Some human developments are especially broad and take years to unfold fully.
        Example:
        A person's ever-evolving ability to ‚Äúread‚Äù other's moods may take a lifetime to develop fully. Other developments are faster and more focused, like a person's increasing skill at solving crossword puzzles.
        The faster and simpler the change is, the more likely it is to be called ‚Äúlearning‚Äù instead of development. The difference between learning and development is a matter of degree. 
        Example:
        When a child learns to name the planets of the solar system the child may not need a lot of time, or does the learning involve a multitude of experiences. So it is probably better to think of that particular experience, learning to name the planets, as an example of learning rather than of development (Salkind, 2004; Lewis, 1997).
        Students‚Äô development matters for teachers, but the way it matters depends partly on how schooling is organised. 
        In teaching a single, ‚Äúself-contained‚Äù class level, the benefits of knowing about development will be less explicit, but just as real, as if teaching many class levels.
        Working exclusively with a single class highlights differences among students that happen in spite of their similar ages, and obscures similarities that happen because of having similar ages.
        Under these conditions it is still easy to notice students‚Äô diversity, but harder to know how much of it comes from differences in long-term development, compared to differences in short-term experiences. 
        Knowledge about long term changes is still useful, however, in planning appropriate activities and in holding appropriate expectations about students. 
        What changes in students can a teacher expect relatively soon simply from his current program of activities, and which ones may take a year or more to show up? 
        This is a question that developmental psychology can help to answer

        This is a question that developmental psychology can help to answer.
        If a teacher teaches multiple class levels then his need for developmental knowledge will be more obvious because he will confront wide age differences on a daily basis. 
        Example:
        A physical education teacher may teach kindergarten children at one time during the day, but sixth-graders at another time, or teach seventh-graders at one time but twelfth-graders at another.
        Students will differ more obviously because of age, in addition to differing because of other factors like their skills or knowledge learned recently. 
        Nonetheless, the instructional challenge will be the same as the one faced by teachers of single-level classes: all teachers want to know what activities and expectations are appropriate for their students. 
        To answer this question, teachers need to know not only about how students are unique, but also about general trends of development during childhood and adolescence.

                The Learning Process
                Learning is generally defined as relatively permanent changes in behaviour, skills, knowledge or attitudes resulting from identifiable psychological or social experiences.
                A key feature is permanence: changes do not count as learning if they are temporary. You do not learn a phone number if you forget it the minute after you dial the number; you do not learn to like vegetables if you only eat them when forced. The change has to last.
                Learning can be physical, social, emotional or cognitive. 
                You do not learn to sneeze by catching a cold, but you do have to learn many skills and behaviours that are physically based, such as riding a bicycle or throwing a ball. 
                You can also learn to like (or dislike) a person, even though this change may not
                ning   

            Learning is not the same as teaching. The distinction between learning and teaching is especially important for teachers to remember. 
            Teachers must be careful not to confuse their efforts (i.e. teaching) with what students get from their efforts (i.e. learning).
            The circumstances of teaching, e.g. the number of students in the classroom, can influence teachers‚Äô perceptions of learning, and therefore also influence how they teach. 
            There are several major theories of learning. The two main theories that are explained in this course are behaviourism and constructivism.
            Type 1: Behaviourism
            Type 2: Constructivism
            Behaviourism: This theory emphasises the links that can often be observed among overt behaviours and the circumstances of the behaviours. 
            A variety of behaviourism called operant conditioning has been used by a number of educators to explain and organise management strategies for certain students, especially those with behavioural problems
            Teachers Perspective on Learning (1)
            For teachers, learning usually refers to things that happen in schools or classrooms, even though every teacher can of course describe examples of learning that happen outside of these places. 
            Teachers‚Äô perspectives on learning often emphasize the following three ideas:
            1. Curriculum content and academic achievement 


            2. Sequencing and readiness


            3. The importance of transferring learning to new or future situations 
            Sometimes teachers tend to emphasise whatever is taught in schools deliberately, including both the official curriculum and the various behaviours and routines that make classrooms run smoothly. 
            In practice, defining learning in this way often means that teachers equate learning with the major forms of academic achievement - especially language and mathematics - and to a lesser extent musical skill, physical co-ordination or social sensitivity (Gardner, 1999, 2006). 
            In the classroom, there is a lot of learning that takes place alongside the explicit learning of the curriculum. This is called incidental learning and it occurs without the teacher or learner deliberately trying to make it happen. 
            Teachers often see this incidental learning and welcome it in their classroom. But their responsibility for curriculum goals more often focuses their efforts on what students can learn through conscious, deliberate effort.
            The distinction between teaching and learning creates a secondary issue for teachers: educational readiness. This concept traditionally referred to how well students were prepared to cope with or profit from the activities and expectations of school.
            At older ages, e.g. university level, the term readiness is often replaced by a more specific term: prerequisites.
            Example:

            A young child is ‚Äòready‚Äô to start school if he or she:
            - Is in good health
            - Shows moderately good social skills
            - Can use a pencil to make simple drawings
            It must be noted that this traditional meaning of readiness as preparedness focuses attention on students‚Äô adjustment to school and away from the reverse. Schools and teachers also have a responsibility for adjusting to students. 
            Example:
            If a 5-year-old child normally needs to play a lot and keep active, then a teacher needs to be ‚Äòready‚Äô for this behaviour by planning an educational program that allows a lot of play and physical activity
            Lesson Summary
            Learning is generally defined as relatively permanent changes in behaviour, skills, knowledge or attitudes resulting from identifiable psychological or social experiences.
            Learning can be physical, social, emotional or cognitive.

                Introduction to Behaviourism
                Behaviourism is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals‚Äô observable behaviours: changes in what people say or do. 
                At some point we all use this perspective, whether we call it ‚Äòbehaviourism‚Äô or something else.
                Example: 

                When a person learns how to drive a car, he or she may be concerned primarily with whether he or she can actually do the driving, not with whether he or she can describe or explain how to drive. 
                In the previous example about learning to drive, focusing attention on behaviour instead of on ‚Äòthought‚Äô may have been desirable at that moment, but not necessarily desirable indefinitely or all of the time.
                Even as a beginner, there are times when it is more important to be able to describe how to do an activity rather than actually be able to do it. 
                Focusing on behaviour is not necessarily less desirable than focusing on students‚Äô inner changes such as gains in their knowledge or their personal attitudes. 
                Focusing on behaviour is merely looking at one form of learning: outward learning. 
                If you are teaching, you will need to attend to all forms of learning in students, whether inward or outward. 
                Operant Conditioning
                Operant conditioning is one of many behaviourist perspectives. It focuses on how the consequences of behaviour affect the behaviour over time. It begins with the idea that certain consequences tend to make certain behaviours happen more frequently. 
                Example: 
                If a teacher compliments a student for a good comment made during a discussion, there is more of a chance that the teacher will hear further comments from the student in the future. 
                Skinner observed the behaviour of some tame laboratory rats. He and his assistants put them in a cage that only contained a lever and a tray just big enough to hold a small amount of food.  The image shows the basic set-up, which is sometimes nicknamed a ‚ÄòSkinner Box‚Äô.

                At first the rat would sniff and ‚Äòputter around‚Äô the cage at random, but sooner or later it would find the lever and eventually happen to press it. The lever released a small pellet of food, which the rat would promptly eat. 
                Gradually the rat would spend more time near the lever and press the lever more frequently, getting food more frequently. Eventually the rat would spend most of its time at the lever and eating its fill of food. The rat had ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô that the consequence of pressing the lever was to receive food. 
                Skinner called the changes in the rat‚Äôs behaviour an example of operant conditioning, and gave special names to the different parts of the process. He called the pellets the reinforcement and the lever-pressing the operant (because it operated on the rat‚Äôs environment). 
                Skinner and other behavioural psychologists experimented with using various reinforcers and operants. 
                They also experimented with various patterns of reinforcement (or schedules of reinforcement) as well as with various cues or signals to the animal about when reinforcement was available. 
                It turned out that all of these factors - the operant, the reinforcement, the schedule and the cues - affected how easily and thoroughly operant conditioning occurred.
                Examples:


                Reinforcement was more effective if it came immediately after the crucial operant behaviour, rather than being delayed.
                Reinforcements that happened intermittently (only some of the time) caused learning to take longer, but also caused it to last longer.
                Operant Conditioning and Students‚Äô Learning
                Since the original research about operant conditioning used animals, it is important to ask whether operant conditioning also describes learning in human beings.
                There are countless classroom examples of consequences affecting students‚Äô behaviour in ways that resemble operant conditioning. However, the process certainly does not account for all forms of student learning (Alberto and Troutman, 2005


            - Can take care of personal physical needs
            Consider the following examples showing operant conditioning in action. In the examples, the operant behaviour tends to become more frequent on repeated occasions.
            Examples:


            A young boy makes a silly face (the operant) at another child sitting next to him. Classmates sitting around them giggle in response (the reinforcement).
            A child who is usually very restless sits for five minutes doing an assignment (the operant). The teacher compliments him for working hard (the reinforcement).
            The process of operant conditioning is widespread in classrooms - probably more widespread than teachers realise. This fact makes sense, given the nature of public education. 
            To a large extent, teaching is about making certain consequences (like praise or marks) depend on students‚Äô engaging in certain activities (like reading material or doing assignments)
            Further Key Concepts about Operant Conditioning
            There are further key concepts associated with operant conditioning. 
            These can be confusing because the ideas have names that sound rather ordinary, but have special meanings within the framework of operant conditioning. 
            Extinction
            Generalisation
            Discrimination
            Schedule of reinforcement 
            Schedule of Reinforcement

            The schedule of reinforcement refers to the pattern or frequency by which reinforcement is linked with the operant. If a teacher praises his student for his work, does he do it every time or only sometimes? Frequently or only once in a while? 
            Behavioural psychologists found that partial or intermittent schedules of reinforcement generally cause learning to take longer, but also cause extinction of learning to take longer. 
            This dual principle is important for teachers because so much of the reinforcement they give is partial or intermittent. Typically a teacher can compliment a student a lot of the time, but there will inevitably be occasions when the teacher cannot do so he or she is busy elsewhere in the classroom. 
            The main points from this module are as follows:

                ntroduction to Constructivism
                Constructivism is a perspective on learning that focuses on how students actively create (or construct) knowledge out of experiences. 
                Behaviourist models of learning may be helpful in understanding and influencing what students do, but teachers usually also want to know what students are thinking, and how to enrich what students are thinking.

            The various models of constructivist learning differ in two ways: 
            1. how much a learner constructs knowledge independently, and 
            2. how much a learner takes cues from people who may be more of an expert 
            There are two main types of constructivism called:
            - psychological constructivism


            - social constructivism
            Both types focus on learners‚Äô thinking rather than their behaviour, but they have distinctly different implications for teaching.
            Psychological Constructivism
            The main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by mentally organising and reorganising new information or experiences. 
            The organisation happens partly by relating new experiences to prior knowledge that is already meaningful and well understood. 
            John Dewey
            John Dewey (1859-1952) is a well-known educational philosopher of the early twentieth century associated with constructivism.
            Although Dewey did not use the term constructivism in most of his writing, his point of view relates strongly to constructivism. He discussed in detail the implications of constructivism for educators. 
            Dewey argued that:
            1. Students learn primarily by building their own knowledge.
            2. Teachers should adjust the curriculum to fit students‚Äô prior knowledge and interests.
            3. A curriculum needs to relate to the activities and responsibilities that students will probably have after leaving school.
            To many educators these days, his ideas may seem merely like good common sense, but they were innovative and progressive at the beginning of the twentieth century.
            Jean Piaget
            Another recent example of psychological constructivism is the cognitive theory of Jean Piaget.
            Piaget described learning as interplay between two mental activities that he called assimilation and accommodation. 
            Jean Piaget
            Jean Piaget
            Assimilation
            Accommodation
            Assimilation is the interpretation of new information in terms of pre-existing concepts, information or ideas.
            Example:
            A preschool child who already understands the concept of a bird might initially label any flying object with this term, even butterflies or mosquitoes.
            or Piaget, assimilation and accommodation work together to enrich a child‚Äôs thinking and to create cognitive equilibrium. 
            Cognitive equilibrium is a balance between reliance on prior information and openness to new information. 
            It consists of an ever-growing repertoire of mental representations for objects and experiences. Piaget called each mental representation a schema (plural: schemata).
            A schema is a concept accompanied by an elaborated mixture of vocabulary, actions and experiences related to that concept. 
            Example:


            A child‚Äôs schema for bird includes not only the relevant verbal knowledge, but also the child‚Äôs experiences with birds, pictures of birds and conversations about birds.
            As assimilation and accommodation about birds and other flying objects operate over time, the child does not just revise and add to his vocabulary, but also adds and remembers relevant new experiences and actions. From these collective revisions and additions the child gradually constructs whole new schemata about birds, butterflies, and other flying objects.
            This diagram shows the relationship between the various elements of the Piagetian version of psychological constructivist learning. This model is quite individualistic as it does not say much about how other people involved with the learner might assist in assimilating or accommodating information.  
            His theory is therefore often considered less about learning and more about development or long term change in a person resulting from multiple experiences that may not be planned deliberately.
            Social Constructivism
            Social constructivism (or socio-cultural theory) focuses on the relationships and interactions between a learner and other individuals who are more knowledgeable or experienced. 
            Jerome Bruner
            An early expression of this viewpoint came from the American psychologist Jerome Bruner (1960, 1966, 1996) who became convinced that students could usually learn more than was traditionally expected as long as they were given appropriate guidance and resources.
            Instructional scaffolding is the phrase that Bruner used to describe the support that learners should be given as they learn. 
            Instructional scaffolding literally means a temporary framework like the ones used to construct buildings, which allows a much stronger structure to be built within it. 
            Bruner believes in the importance of providing guidance in the right way and at the right time. When scaffolding is provided correctly, students appear to be more competent and they learn more
            Lev Vygotsky

            Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, proposed similar ideas to Bruner‚Äôs ideas about social constructivism. 
            Vygotsky‚Äôs focused on how a child‚Äôs or novice‚Äôs thinking is influenced by relationships with others who are more capable, knowledgeable or expert than the learner. 
            Vygotsky made the reasonable proposal that when a child (or novice) is learning a new skill or solving a new problem, he or she can perform better if accompanied and helped by an expert than if performing alone - though still not as well as the expert.
            Example: 


            A person who has played very little chess will probably compete better against an opponent if he or she is helped by an expert chess player rather than if competing against the opponent alone. 
            Vygotsky called the difference between solo performance and assisted performance the zone
            Theoretical Differences between Psychological and Social Constructivism
            Psychological constructivism and social constructivism have differences that suggest different ways for teachers to teach most effectively. 
            The theoretical differences are related to three ideas in particular:
            1. The relationship between learning and long-term development.
            2. The role of generalisations and abstractions during development.
            3. The mechanism by which development occurs
            1. The relationship between learning and long-term  development 
            In general, psychological constructivism emphasises the way that long-term development determines a child‚Äôs ability to learn, rather than the other way around. 
            The earliest stages of a child‚Äôs life are thought to be rather self-centred and to be dependent on the child‚Äôs sensory and motor interactions with the environment. 
            When acting or reacting to his or her surroundings, the child has relatively little language skill initially. This circumstance limits the child‚Äôs ability to learn in the usual, school-like sense of the term.
            As development proceeds, of course, language skills improve and hence the child becomes progressively more ‚Äòteachable‚Äô and in this sense more able to learn. But whatever the child‚Äôs age, ability to learn waits or depends upon the child‚Äôs stage of development.
            From this point of view, a primary responsibility of teachers is to provide a very rich classroom environment, so that children can interact with it independently and gradually make themselves ready for verbal learning. 
            Alternatively, social constructivists emphasise the importance of social interaction in stimulating the development of the child. 
            Language and dialogue therefore are primary, and development is seen as happening as a result - the converse of the sequence by psychological constructivists.
            Obviously a child does not begin life with a lot of initial language skill, but this fact is why interactions need to be scaffolded by more experienced experts, i.e. people capable of creating a zone of proximal development in their conversations and other interactions. 
            In the preschool years, the experts are usually parents. After the child begins school, the experts broaden to include teachers. 
            A teacher‚Äôs primary responsibility is therefore to provide very rich opportunities for dialogue, both among children and between individual children and the teacher.
            The role of generalisations and abstractions during development
            Psychological constructivism tends to see a relatively limited role for abstract or hypothetical reasoning in the life of children, and even in the reasoning of youth and many adults.  
            Abstract thinking, according to psychological constructivism, emerges relatively slowly and relatively late in development, after a person accumulates considerable experience.  
            Social constructivism sees abstract thinking emerging from dialogue between a relative novice (a child or youth) and a more experienced expert (a parent or teacher). 
            The more this type of dialogue occurs, then the more the child can acquire abstract thinking skills. The dialogue must, of course, honour a child‚Äôs need for intellectual scaffolding or a zone of proximal development. 
            The mechanism by which development occurs


            In psychological constructivism, development is thought to happen because of the interplay between assimilation and accommodation - between when a child or youth can already understand or conceive of, and the change required of that understanding by new experiences. 
            Acting together, assimilation and accommodation continually create new states of cognitive equilibrium. 
            A teacher can therefore stimulate development by provoking cognitive dissonance (conflict) deliberately, e.g. by confronting a student with sights, actions or ideas that do not fit with the student's existing experiences and ideas. 
            In practice the dissonance is often communicated verbally, by posing questions that are new or that students may have misunderstood in the past. 
            Dissonance can also be provoked through pictures or activities that are unfamiliar to students, e.g. students could engage in community service projects that brings them in contact with people who they had previously considered ‚Äòstrange‚Äô or different from themselves.
            Implications of Constructivism for Teaching
            As an educator, whether you follow psychological constructivism or social constructivism, there are constructivist strategies for helping students to develop their thinking.
            There are two major strategies:
            1. Organisation of the content systematically
            2. Metacognition: thinking about learning 
            Strategy 1 - Organisation of the content systematically
            One strategy that teachers often find helpful is to organise the content to be learned as systematically as possible. Doing this allows the teacher to select and devise learning activities that are better tailored to students‚Äô cognitive abilities and/or promote better dialogue. 
            One of the most widely used frameworks for organising content is a classification scheme proposed by the educator Benjamin Bloom.
            Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy makes useful distinctions among possible kinds of knowledge needed by students, and therefore potentially helps in selecting activities that truly target students‚Äô zone of proximal development.  Decide whether Goldilocks was a bad girl, and justify your position. Bloom‚Äôs categories of cognitive thinking are outlined below using the story of ‚ÄòGoldilocks and the Three Bears‚Äô as an example.
            Knowledge
            Definition - Remembering or recalling facts, information, or procedures.
            Example - List three things Goldilocks did in the three bears'house. 
            Comprehension

            Application

            Analysis
            Strategy 2 - Metacognition: thinking about learning 
            As students gain experience of being a learner, they become able to think about how they themselves learn best. The teacher can explicitly encourage such self-reflection and self-assessment as a learning goal. This allows the teacher to transfer some of the responsibility for arranging learning to the students themselves. 
            This self-assessment and self-direction of learning by the students themselves is known as metacognition. Metacognition is an ability to think about and regulate one‚Äôs own thinking (Israel, 2005).
            Metacognition can sometimes be difficult for students to achieve, but it is an important goal for social constructivist learning because it gradually frees learners from dependence on expert teachers to guide their learning. Reflective learners become their own expert guide
            The main points from this module are as follows:
            Constructivism is a perspective on learning that focuses on how students actively construct knowledge out of experiences. 
            The main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by mentally organising and reorganising new information or experiences. 
            John Dewey is an educational philosopher of the early twentieth century associated with constructivism.
            Jean Piaget described learning as interplay between two mental activities called assimilation and accommodation. For Piaget, assimilation and accommodation work together to enrich a child‚Äôs thinking and to create cognitive equilibrium.
            cial constructivism (or socio-cultural theory) focuses on the relationships and interactions between a learner and other individuals who are more knowledgeable or experienced. 
            Instructional scaffolding is the phrase that the American psychologist Bruner used to describe the support that learners should be given as they learn. 
            Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, proposed similar ideas to Bruner‚Äôs ideas about social constructivism. Vygotsky‚Äôs writing focused on how a child‚Äôs or novice‚Äôs thinking is influenced by relationships with others who are more capable, knowledgeable or expert than the learner. 
            The theoretical differences between social constructivism and psychological constructivism are related to three ideas in particular:
            1. The relationship between learning and long-term development of the child
            2. The role of generalisations and abstractions during development
            3. The mechanism by which development occurs

            Special Education and Legalisation
            Special education is education that addresses the individual differences and requirements of a student with special needs. 
            Statistically, the most frequent forms of special needs are learning disabilities: impairments in specific aspects of learning and especially of reading. 
            Learning disabilities account for about half of all special educational needs: as much as all other types put together. Speech and language disorders, intellectual disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) are less common. 
            Since the 1970s, support for people with disabilities and special educational needs has grown significantly. Political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people with disabilities into a wide variety of ‚Äòregular‚Äô activities.  
            Case Study: Legalisation changes in the United States and its effects
            Three major laws were passed in the United States since the 1970‚Äôs that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and of children and students with disabilities in particular.  American laws that related to students with special educational needs were:
            Rehabilitation Act of 1973
            Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
            Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 1975/2004
            Rehabilitation Act of 1973
            This law required that individuals with disabilities be accommodated in any program or activity that receives funding from the government funding. 
            These new laws affected teachers‚Äô work in the classroom and had a big impact on education in general in the United States. 
            Similar changes in laws have occurred in countries all over the world. While most teachers certainly support these changes in broad terms, others have found the prospect of applying it in the classroom leads to a number of questions and concerns. 
            Possible concerns from teachers:
            1. Will a student with a disability disrupt the class?
            2. Will the student interfere with covering the curriculum?
            3. Will the student be teased by classmates?
            These are legitimate concerns from teachers. One step towards reducing levels of concern is to learn more about the general responsibilities of teachers for students with disabilitie
            Teachers‚Äô Responsibilities for Special Education
            Changes in educational legalisation have affected the work of teachers by creating three new expectations.
            These expectations are:
            - To provide alternative methods of assessment for students with disabilities. 
            - To arrange a learning environment that is as normal or as ‚Äòleast restrictive‚Äô as possible.
            - To participate in creating individual educational plans for students with disabilities. 
            Expectation 1: Provide Alternative Assessments 
            In the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to gathering information about a student in order to identify the strengths of the student and to decide what special educational support, if any, the student needs. In principle, of course, these are tasks that teachers have for all students. 
            Assessment is a major reason why teachers give tests and assignments, for example, and why they listen carefully to the quality of students‚Äô comments during class discussions.
            For students with disabilities, such traditional strategies of assessment as tests and assignments, often seriously underestimate the students‚Äô competence (Koretz & Barton, 2003/2004; Pullin, 2005). 
            Depending on the disability, a student may have trouble with: 
            - Holding a pencil
            - Hearing a question clearly
            - Focusing on a picture
            - Recording an answer in time even when he or she knows the answer
            - Concentrating on a task in the presence of other people
            - Answering a question at the pace needed by the rest of the class
            Traditionally, teachers have assumed that all students either have these skills or can learn them with just modest amounts of coaching, encouragement and will power. 
            Example:
            For many students it may be enough to say something like: ‚ÄúRemember to listen to the question carefully!‚Äù. For students with disabilities, however, a comment like this may not work and may even be insensitive. 
            There are a number of strategies for modifying assessments in ways that attempt to be fair and that at the same time recognise how busy teachers usually are. 
            These strategies include:
            Supplementing conventional assignments with portfolios. A portfolio is a collection of a student‚Äôs work that demonstrates a student‚Äôs development over time. It usually includes some sort of reflective or evaluative comments from the student, the teacher, or both (Carothers & Taylor, 2003; Wesson & King, 1996). 
            Devising a system for observing the student regularly and informally recording notes about the observations. 
            Recruiting help from teacher assistants who are sometimes present to help a student with a disability.
            Expectation 2: Arrange a Least Restrictive Environment
            A ‚Äòleast restrictive environment‚Äô is defined as the combination of settings that involve the student with regular classrooms and school programs as much as possible. 
            The precise combination is determined by the circumstances of a particular school and of the student. See next page for related examples.
            Examples:


            A young child with a mild cognitive disability may spend the majority of time in a regular classroom, working alongside and playing with non-disabled classmates and relying on a teacher assistant for help where needed. 
            An individual with a similar disability in high school, however, might be assigned primarily to classes specially intended for slow learners, but nonetheless participate in some school-wide activities alongside non-disabled students The correct ‚Äòleast restrictive environment‚Äô for each individual student will vary depending on the following types of factors:
            - The severity of the disability
            - The level of resources in a given school, e.g. number of teaching assistants 
            - The teacher‚Äôs perception of how difficult it is to modify the curriculum 
            Expectation 3: Create an Individual Education Plan
            An individual education plan (IEP) should be created by a team of individuals who know the student‚Äôs strengths and needs. 
            This team should include:
            - The classroom teacher
            - The resource or special education teacher
            - The student‚Äôs parents or guardians
            - A school administrator e.g. a vice-principal
            - Other external professionals depending on the disability, e.g. a psychologist, physician or speech therapist
            An IEP can vary from student to student, but it usually includes the following core elements:
            - The student‚Äôs current social and academic strengths
            - The student‚Äôs current social or academic needs
            - The educational goals or objectives for the student for the coming year
            - Details about special services to be provided to the student
            - Details about how progress will be assessed at the end of the year
            Individual Educational Plan (IEP)

            This image shows a simple, imaginary Individual Educational Plan (IEP).
            The actual visual formats of an IEP vary widely from country to country.
            This particular plan is for a student named Sean, who has difficulty with reading.
            The different sections of this IEP will be reviewed in the following pages.

            This part of the form supplies general details about the student and the student's school.

            This part of the form lists the people responsible for creating and facilitating the IEP e.g. parents, class teacher, speech and language therapist. The members of this team will depend on the nature of the child's disability.
            Strengths and Needs
            This part of the form outlines the student's current social and academic strengths as veil as the student's social or academic needs.
            It also specifies educational goals or objectives for the coming year, lists special services to be provided, and describes how progress towards the goals will be assessed at the end of the year.
            The Value of Inclusive Education
            Including students with disabilities in regular classrooms is valuable for everyone concerned. 
            The students with disabilities themselves tend to experience a richer educational environment, both socially and academically. 
            Classmates of students with disabilities also experience a richer educational environment. They potentially meet a wider range of students a
            Many teaching strategies help students with disabilities precisely because they are individualised and differentiate among students' needs more than conventional whole-group teaching practices. This differentiation turns out to benefit all students, regardless of their levels of skill or readiness. 
            Everyone, not just students with disabilities, benefits from: 
            - Careful planning of objectives
            - Attention to individual differences among students
            - Establishment of a positive social atmosphere in the classroom
            Categories of Disabilities
            There are several categories of disabilities ranging from a mild learning disability to a severe intellectual disability. 
            Describing the exact nature of students‚Äô disabilities can be difficult. Part of the reason for this is because disabilities are essentially ambiguous. 
            Naming and describing ‚Äòtypes‚Äô of them implies that disabilities are relatively fixed, stable and distinct, like different kinds of fruit or vegetables. 
            Lesson Summary
            Special education is education that addresses the individual differences and requirements of a student with special needs. 

            Since the 1970s, support for people with disabilities and special educational needs has grown significantly. 

            Changes in educational laws have affected the work of teachers by creating three new expectations in relation to special education. These expectations are:
            - To provide alternative methods of assessment for students with disabilities. 
            - To arrange a learning environment that is as normal or as ‚Äòleast restrictive‚Äô as possible.
            - To participate in creating individual educational plans for students with disabilities. 
            In the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to gathering information about a student in order to identify the strengths of the student and to decide what special educational support, if any, the student needs.

                Introduction to Learning Disabilities
                A learning disability is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student‚Äôs academic performance significantly. 
                A learning disability shows itself as a major discrepancy between a student‚Äôs ability and some feature of achievement. 
                The student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking or doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once. 
                A learning problem is not considered a learning disability if it stems from physical, sensory or motor handicaps or from generalised intellectual impairment (or mental retardation). 
                It is also not a learning disability if the learning problem really reflects the challenges of learning English as a second language. 
                Genuine learning disabilities are the learning problems left over after these other possibilities are accounted for or excluded. 
                Typically, a student with a learning disability has not been helped by teachers‚Äô ordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind academically. 
                What counts as an ‚Äòordinary effort‚Äô, of course, differs among teachers, schools and students. 
                Most importantly, though, a learning disability relates to a fairly specific area of academic learning, e.g. a student may be able to read and compute well enough but not be able to write.
                Learning disabilities are by far the most common form of special educational need. 
                Example: 
                In the United States, learning disabilities account for half of all students with special educational needs and anywhere from 5% to 20% of all students, depending on how the numbers are estimated (United States Department of Education, 2005; Ysseldyke & Bielinski, 2002). 
                Students with learning disabilities are so common, in fact, that most teachers regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school year, regardless of the class level they teach.
                Defining Learning Disabilities Clearly - With so many students defined as having learning disabilities, it is not surprising that the term itself becomes ambiguous in the truest sense of ‚Äòhaving many meanings With so many expressions of learning disabilities, it is not surprising that educators sometimes disagree about their nature and about the kind of help students need as a consequence. 
                Such controversy may be inevitable because learning disabilities by definition are learning problems with no obvious origin. 
                Common to all educators though is a belief that a variety of strategies for helping students with learning disabilities should be experimented with.
                Case Study: Assisting a Student with a Learning Disability
                Introduction
                There are various ways to assist students with learning disabilities, depending not only on the nature of the disability, of course, but also on the concepts or theory of learning being used. 
                This case study looks at a girl with a learning disability called Sarah. She adds two-digit numbers as if they were one digit numbers. 
                Stated more formally, Sarah adds two-digit numbers without carrying digits forward from the ones column to the tens column, or from the tens to the hundreds column.  

            Example of Sarah's Homework  
            This is an example of Sarah‚Äôs math homework involving two-digit addition. 
            Three out of the six problems are done correctly, even though Sarah seems to use an incorrect strategy systematically on all six problems. 
            Behaviourism and Reinforcement 

            One possible approach to assist Sarah is based on the behaviourist theory. It seems that Sarah was rewarded so much for adding single-digit numbers (3+5, 7+8 etc.) correctly that she generalised this skill to adding two-digit problems. 
            Changing Sarah‚Äôs behaviour is tricky since the desired behaviour (borrowing correctly) rarely happens and therefore cannot be reinforced very often. It might help for the teacher to reward behaviours that compete directly with Sarah‚Äôs inappropriate strategy. 
            The teacher might reduce credit for simply finding the correct answer and increase credit for a student showing her the work of carrying digits forward correctly. Or the teacher might discuss Sarah‚Äôs maths work with Sarah frequently, so as to create more occasions when she can praise Sarah for working problems correctly.
            Reflective Learning

            Part of Sarah‚Äôs problem may be that she is thoughtless about doing her maths. The minute she sees numbers on a worksheet, she stuffs them into the first arithmetic procedure that comes to mind. Her learning style seems too impulsive and not reflective enough. 
            As a solution, the teacher could encourage Sarah to think out loud when she completes two-digit problems-literally get her to ‚Äòtalk her way through‚Äô each problem
            Constructivism and the Zone of Proximal Development
            Perhaps Sarah has in fact learned how to carry digits forward, but not learned the procedure well enough to use it reliably on her own.
            In that case her problem can be seen in the constructivist terms. Sarah has lacked appropriate mentoring from someone more expert than herself, someone who can create a ‚Äòzone of proximal development‚Äô in which she can display and consolidate her skills more successfully. 
            She still needs mentoring or ‚Äòassisted coaching‚Äô more than independent practice.The teacher can arrange some of this in much the way she encourages to be more reflective, either by working with Sarah herself or by arranging for a classmate or even a parent volunteer to do so. 
            Lesson Summary
            A learning disability is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student‚Äôs academic performance significantly. 
            Learning disabilities are by far the most common form of special educational need. 

            There are various ways to assist students with learning disabilities, depending not only on the nature of the disability, of course, but also on the concepts or theory of learning being used:
            - Behaviourism and reinforcement for wrong strategies
            - Metacognition and responding reflectively
            - Constructivism, mentoring and the zone of proximal development

            Introduction to ADHD
            Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a problem with sustaining attention and controlling impulses. 
            Almost all students have these problems at one time or another, but a student with ADHD shows them much more frequently than usual and often at home as well as at school. 
            In the classroom, a student with ADHD may:
            - Fidget and squirm a lot
            - Have trouble remaining seated
            - Continually get distracted and go off task
            - Have trouble waiting for a turn
            - Blurt out answers and comments
            - Shift continually from one activity to another
            - Have trouble playing quietly
            - Talk excessively without listening to others
            - Misplace things and seem generally disorganised
            - Be inclined to try risky activities without giving enough thought to the consequences 
            Differences in perceptions: ADHD versus high activity
            It is important to note that classrooms are places that make heavy demands on not showing ADHD-like behaviours.
            In classrooms, students are often supposed to:
            - Sit for long periods
            - Avoid interrupting others
            - Finish tasks after beginning them
            - Keep their minds (and materials) organised
            Ironically, classroom life may sometimes aggravate ADHD without the teacher intending for it to do so.
            Teaching Students with ADHD
            Research shows that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be reduced for many students if they take certain medications, of which the most common is methylphenidate, commonly known by the name Ritalin (Wilens, 2005; Olfson, 2003). 
            This drug and others like it act by stimulating the nervous system, which reduces symptoms by helping a student pay better attention to the choices he or she makes and to the impact of actions on others.
            Unfortunately the medications do not work on all students with ADHD, especially after they reach adolescence. Its long-term effects are uncertain also (Breggin, 1999). 
            In any case Ritalin and similar drugs have certain practical problems:
            - Drugs cost money which is a problem for a family without much money to begin with, or for a family lacking medical insurance that pays for medications.
            - Drugs must be taken regularly in order to be effective, including on weekends. Keeping a regular schedule can be difficult if parents‚Äô own schedules are irregular or simply differ from the child‚Äôs, e.g. due to night shifts at work or if parents are separated and share custody of the child.
            In any case, since teachers are not doctors and medications are not under teachers‚Äô control, it may be more important simply to provide an environment where a student with ADHD can organise choices and actions easily and successfully.
            Strategies for teaching students with ADHD include:
            Strategy 1 - Providing clear rules and procedures
            Strategy 2 - Breaking down tasks into manageable chunks 
            Strategy 3 - Modelling suitable behaviour
            Strategy 1
            Strategy 2
            Strategy 3
            Strategy 1: Providing clear rules and procedures 
            Clear rules and procedures can reduce the ‚Äònoise‚Äô or chaotic quality in the child‚Äôs classroom life significantly. 
            The rules and procedures can be generated jointly with the child; they do not have to be imposed arbitrarily, as if the student were incapable of thinking about them reasonably. 
            Lesson Summary
            Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem with sustaining attention and controlling impulses. 
            Classrooms are places that make heavy demands on not showing ADHD-like behaviours. However, classroom life may sometimes aggravate ADHD without the teacher intending for it to do so.

            Most psychologists and medical specialists agree that true ADHD, as opposed to mere intermittent distractibility or high activity, reflects a problem in how the nervous system functions, but they do not know the exact nature or causes of the problem (Rutter, 2004, 2005). 

            Research shows that ADHD can be reduced for many students if they take certain medications, of which the most common is methylphenidate, commonly known by the name Ritalin (Wilens, 2005; Olfson, 2003). 

            Strategies that a teacher can use when dealing with students with ADHD include:

                Identify three strategies that teachers use when teaching students with intellectual disabilitie

            Introduction to Intellectual Disabilities
            An intellectual disability is a significant limitation in a student‚Äôs cognitive functioning and daily adaptive behaviours  (Schalock & Luckasson, 2004; American Association on Mental Retardation, 2002). 
            The student may have limited language or impaired speech and may not perform well academically.
            Compared to students with learning disabilities, students with intellectual disabilities have impairments to learning that are broader and more significant:
            - They score poorly on standardised tests of intelligence. 
            - Everyday tasks that most people take for granted, like getting dressed or eating a meal may be possible, but they may also take more time and effort than usual. 
            - Health and safety can sometimes be a concern, e.g. knowing whether it is safe to cross a street. 
            - For older individuals, finding and keeping a job may require help from supportive others. 
            The exact combination of challenges varies from one person to another, but it always (by definition) i
            ere are many terms used to describe students with intellectual disabilities. If the disability is mild, teachers sometimes refer to a student with the disability simply as a slow learner, particularly if the student has no formal, special supports for the disability, e.g. a teaching assistant.  
            If the disability is more marked, then the student is more likely to be referred to as having an intellectual disability or as having mental retardation.
            In this course the term intellectual disability is used, because it has fewer negative connotations while still describing one key educational aspect of the disability, cognitive impai
            nvolves limitations in both intellectual and daily functioning.
            Intellectual disabilities happen in different degrees or amounts, though most often are relatively mild. 
            Traditionally the intensity or ‚Äòamount‚Äô of the disability was defined by scores on a standardised test of scholastic aptitude (or ‚ÄòIQ test‚Äô), with lower scores indicating more severe disability. 
            Nowadays, due to the insensitivity of such tests to individuals‚Äô daily social functioning, levels of intellectual disability are more often defined by the amount of support needed by the individual.  
            Levels of support range from intermittent (just occasional or ‚Äòas needed‚Äô for specific activities) to pervasive (continuous in all realms of livin
            The intellectual disabilities that a classroom teacher is most likely to see are the ones requiring the least support in the classroom.
            A student requiring only intermittent support may require special help with some learning activities or classroom routines, but not others. 
            Example:


            A student might need help with reading or putting on winter clothes but primarily on occasions when there is pressure to do these things relatively quickly. 
            Students requiring somewhat more support are likely to spend less time in the mainstream classroom and more time receiving special help from other professionals, e.g. a special education teacher or a speech and language specialist.
            These circumstances have distinct implications for the ways to teach students with intellectual disabilities.
            Teaching Students with Intellectual Disabilities
            There are many specific techniques that can help in teaching students with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities. 
            Most of these techniques can be summarised into three general strategies as follows:
            1. Give more time and practice than usual to the student.


            2. Embed activities into the context of daily life or functioning where possible.


            3.  Include the student in both social and academic activities
            Strategy 1: Give more time and practice than usual to the student
            If a student has only a mild intellectual disability, he or she can probably learn important fundamentals of the academic curriculum, e.g. basic arithmetic and basic reading. As a result of the disability, though, the student may need more time or practice than most other students. 
            Example:


            A student may know that 2 + 3 = 5, but need help applying this math fact to real objects. 
            The teacher or teaching assistant might need to show the student that two pencils plus three pencils make five pencils.
            Setting expectations too low actually deprives a student with an intellectual disability of rightful opportunities to learn, a serious ethical and professional mistake (Bogdan, 2006). 

            Fortunately, in many curriculum areas, there are already existing materials that are simplified, yet also appropriate for older students (Snell, et al., 2005). 
            Special education teacher-specialists can often help in finding them and in devising effective ways of using them.

            Introduction to Behavioural Disorders
            Behavioural disorders are a diverse group of conditions in which a student chronically performs highly inappropriate behaviours. 
            Students with this condition might seek attention, e.g. acting out disruptively in class. 
            Other students with the condition might:
            - Behave aggressively
            - Be distractible and overly active
            - Seem anxious or withdrawn or seem disconnected from everyday reality
            s with learning disabilities, the sheer range of signs and symptoms defies concise description. But the problematic behaviours do have several general features in common (Kauffman, 2005; Hallahan & Kauffman, 2006). 
            The problematic behaviours tend to:
            - Be extreme
            - Affect school work
            - Persist for extended periods of time
            - Be socially unacceptable, e.g. unwanted sexual advances or vandalism against school property 
            - Have no other obvious explanation, e.g. a health problem or temporary disruption in the family
            The variety among behavioural disorders means that estimates of their frequency tend to vary across educational systems. 
            It also means that in some cases, a student with a behavioural disorder may be classified as having a different condition, such as ADHD or a learning disabilit

            Lesson Summary
            Behavioural disorders are a diverse group of conditions in which a student chronically performs highly inappropriate behaviours. 
            Available statistics suggest that only about 1% to 2% of students, or perhaps less, have true behavioural disorders - a figure that is only about one half or one third of the frequency for intellectual disabilities (Kauffman, 2005).
            The most common challenges of teaching students with behavioural disorders are related to classroom management. 
            Strategies for teaching students with behavioural disorders include:
            - Identifying circumstances that trigger the inappropriate behaviours.
            - Teaching of interpersonal skills explicitly.
            - Disciplining a student fairly.
            A wide variety of factors can trigger inappropriate behaviour:
            - Physiological effects.

                Introduction to Physical Disabilities and Sensory Impairments
                Some students have serious physical, medical or sensory challenges that interfere with their learning. Usually, the physical and medical challenges are medical conditions or diseases that require ongoing medical care. The sensory challenges are usually a loss either in hearing or in vision, or more rarely in both. 
                These types of physical disabilities and sensory impairments are often serious enough to interfere with activities in regular classroom programs. These types of disabilities also often qualify the student for special educational services or programs
                Hearing Loss
                A child can acquire a hearing loss for a variety of reasons, ranging from disease early in childhood, to difficulties during childbirth, to reactions to toxic drugs. In the classroom, however, the cause of the loss is virtually irrelevant because it makes little difference in how to accommodate a student‚Äôs educational needs. 
                More important than the cause of the loss is its extent. Students with only mild or moderate loss of hearing are sometimes called hearing impaired or hard of hearing. Only those with nearly complete loss are called deaf. 
                As with other sorts of disabilities, the milder the hearing loss, the more likely it is that the student is in a regular classroom, at least for part of the day. 
                Signs of Hearing Loss
                Although determining whether a student has a hearing loss may seem quite straightforward, i.e. by administering a hearing test, the assessment is often not clear cut if it takes the student‚Äôs daily experiences into account. 
                A serious or profound hearing loss tends to be noticed relatively quickly and therefore can often receive special help sooner. 
                Mild or moderate hearing loss is much more common and is more likely to be overlooked or mistaken for some other sort of learning problem (Sherer, 2004). 
                Examples:
                Students with a mild hearing loss sometimes have somewhat lower language and literacy skills but so do some students without any loss. 
                Students with a mild hearing loss may seem not to listen to a speaker because of trouble in locating the source of sounds, but then again, sometimes students without loss also fail to listen.

                Teaching Students with Hearing Loss
                In principle, adjustments in teaching students with hearing loss are relatively easy to make though they do require deliberate actions or choices by the teacher and by fellow students. Interestingly, many of the strategies are good advice for teaching all students.
                The three main strategies are:
                Take advantage of the student‚Äôs residual hearing.


                Use visual cues liberally. 


                Include the student in the community of the classroom. 
                The three main strategies are:
                Strategy 1
                Strategy 2
                Strategy 3
                Strategy 1: Take advantage of the student‚Äôs residual hearing
                The teacher should:
                - Sit the student close to him or her while talking or close to key classmates if the students are in a work group. 
                - Keep competing noise to a minimum, e.g. any unnecessary talking or whispering, as this type of noise is particularly distracting to someone with hearing loss. 
                - Keep instructions concise and to-the-point. 
                - Ask the student occasionally whether he or she understands what is being explained.
                Teaching Students with Visual Impairment
                In general, advice for teaching students with mild or moderate visual impairment parallels the advice for teaching students with hearing loss, though with obvious differences because of the nature of the students‚Äô disabilities.
                The three main strategies are:
                Take advantage of the student‚Äôs residual vision.


                Use non-visual information liberally. 


                Include the student in the community of the classroom.
                The three main strategies are:
                Strategy 1
                Strategy 2
                Strategy 3
                Strategy 1: Take advantage of the student‚Äôs residual vision
                The teacher should:
                - Place the student (if the student still has some useful vision) where he or she can easily see the most important parts of the classroom - whether that is the teacher, the chalkboard, a video screen or particular fellow students. 
                - Make sure that the classroom, or at least the student‚Äôs part of it, is well lit. Good lighting makes reading easier for students with low vision. 
                - Make sure that handouts, books and other reading materials have good, sharp contrast.

                To see how this influence works, a small case study will be undertaken: how the participation structures affected classroom communication for Kelvin Seifert as he taught one particular topic - children's play - over a twenty-year period (2009). The topic was part of a university-level course for future teachers.
                During this time, Kelvin's goals about the topic remained the same: to stimulate students' thinking about the nature and purposes of play. But over time he tried several different structures of participation, and students' ways of communicating changed as a result.
                To view Kelvin Seifret's notes from the case study, please download the PDF labelled "Module 3 Download: Kelvin's Class Notes", which can be found in the module list of the course plan.
                Lecture
                The first time Kelvin taught about children's play, he lectured about it.
                He used this structure of participation not because he believed on principle that it was the best, but because it was convenient and used widely by his fellow university teachers.
                In some ways the lecture proved effective:

                    Kelvin covered the material efficiently (in about 20 minutes)
                    He related the topic to other ones in the course
                    He defined and explained all key terms clearly
                    He did his best to relate the material to what he thought were students' own interests

                ut there were also some negative signs. In spite of their courtesy, few students lingered after class to talk about children's play or to ask questions.
                Worst yet, few students chose children's play as a term paper topic, even though it might have made a highly interesting and enjoyable one.
                On the final exam few seemed able to relate concepts about play to their own experiences as teachers or leaders of recreational activities.
                There was an even more subtle problem. The lecture about play focused overtly on a topic (play) that praised action, intrinsic motivation, and self-choice.
                But by presenting these ideas as a lecture, Kelvin also implied an opposite message unintentionally: that learning is something done passively, and that it follows an intellectual path set only by the teacher.
                Even the physical layout of the classroom sent this message - desks faced forward, as if to remind students to look only at the person lecturin
                These were all marks of good lecturing (Christensen, 2006). 
                Questions and Answers
                Because of these problems, Kelvin modified his approach after a few years of teaching to include more asking of questions which students were invited to answer.
                This turned the lecture on children's play into something more like a series of explanations of key ideas, interrupted by asking students to express their beliefs, knowledge, or experience about children's play.
                Asking questions and inviting brief responses was reassuring because it gave indications of whether students were listening and understanding the material.
                Questions served both to motivate students to listen and to assess how much and how well they knew the material.
                In this regard Kelvin was using a form of communication that was and continues to be very popular with many teachers (Cazden, 2001).
                Classroom Discussion
                After several more years of teaching, Kelvin quit lectures altogether, even ones interspersed with questions and answers. He began simply leading general discussions about children‚Äôs play.
                Instead of outlining detailed content, he now just made concise notes that listed issues about children‚Äôs play that students needed to consider.
                The shift in participation structure led to several major changes in communication between teacher and students as well as among students.
                Since students spoke more freely than before, it became easier to see whether they cared about the topic.
                Now, too, more students seemed motivated to think and learn about children‚Äôs play; quite a few selected this topic, for example, for their term projects. Needless to say, these changes were all to the good.
                But there were also changes that limited the effectiveness of classroom communication, even though students were nominally freer to speak than ever. 

                    Kelvin found, for example, that certain students spoke more than their share of the time - almost too freely, in fact, in effect preventing more hesitant students from speaking. 

                    Sometimes, too, it seemed as if certain students did not listen to others‚Äô comments, but instead just passed the time waiting for their turn to speak, their hands propped permanently in the air. 

                    Meanwhile there were still others who passed the time apparently hoping not to speak; they were busy doodling or staring out the window.

                    Furthermore, since the precise focus of discussion was no longer under Kelvin‚Äôs control, discussions often did not cover all of the ideas about children‚Äôs play that Kelvin considered important. 
                    Group Work
                    By the time he had taught about children‚Äôs play for twenty years, Kelvin had developed enough concerns about discussion as a communication strategy that he shifted approach again. 
                    This time he began using a form of collaborative group work: small teams of students carrying out projects on aspects of children‚Äôs play that interested them, making observations of children at play, reporting on their results to the class, and writing a common report about their work.
                    Kelvin hoped that by giving students a common focus, communication among them would improve.
                    Conversations would deal with the tasks at hand, students would necessarily listen to each other, and no one could afford either to dominate talk excessively or to fall silent.

                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Participation structures are patterns that guide communication in ways that class members learn to expect.
                     The four most used participation structures are: Lectures, Questions and Answers, Discussion, and Group Work. 
                    Each participation structure has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

                Lectures: Disadvantages

                     A lack of interaction from students is likely in this environment.
                    In the case study, few students chose children's play as a topic on the exam.

                    Why Using Classroom Talk is Important
                    The various features of classroom talk characterize the communication of most teachers and students, at least when they are in a classroom and ‚Äúdoing school‚Äù. (Communication outside of school is a different matter: then teachers as well as students may speak, listen, and behave quite differently!) 
                    As you might suppose, the extent and balance among the features varies depending on grade level, curriculum area, and personalities of students or teachers. But failing to use a classroom register at all can easily create communication problems.
                    ommunity within the classroom

                Suppose, for example, that a teacher never asks informal test questions. In that case the teacher will learn much less than otherwise about her students‚Äô knowledge of the current material.
                Then also suppose that a student does not understand the teachers‚Äô questions as test questions. 
                That student may easily respond in ways that seem disrespectful 
                (Teacher: ‚ÄúHow much is 23 x 42?‚Äù 
                Student: . "I don't know; how much do you think it is?") (Bloome, et al., 2005).
                There can also be problems even when students understand the usual expectations about classroom communication, simply because the expectations can sometimes constrain certain activities indirectly. 
                A case in point is science education. Jay Lemke has studied dialogue during science lessons among students and between students and teachers (1990). He concluded that much of it is inconsistent with genuine scientific pra
                Probing for Learner Understanding
                How do you know whether a student understands what you are saying? One clue of course, is by whether the student is looking at and concentrating on you and your comments. 
                But this clue is not foolproof; everyone has had moments of staring at a speaker while daydreaming, only to realize later that they have not heard anything that the speaker said. 
                It is sometimes important, therefore, to probe more actively how much students are actually understanding during lessons or other activities.
                In explaining a new topic, for example, you can check for understanding by asking preliminary questions connecting the topic to students‚Äô prior experiences and knowledge about the topic. 
                Note that this strategy combines qualities of both instruction and conversation, in the sense that it involves combining ‚Äútest‚Äù questions, to which you already know the answer, with real questions, to which you do not.
                r example, when introducing a science lesson about density to kindergarten children the teacher might reasonably ask both of the following:

                    Teacher: Which of these objects that I have do you expect will sink and which ones will float? (A test question - the teacher already will know the answer.)
                    Teacher: What other things have you seen that float? Or that sink? (A real question - the teacher is asking about their experience and does not know the answer.)

                By asking both kinds of questions, the teacher scaffolds the children‚Äôs learning, or creates a zone of proximal development.
                Note that this zone has two important features, both of which contribute to children‚Äôs thinking. One is that it stimulates students‚Äô thinking (by asking them questions), and the other is that it creates a supportive and caring atmosphere (by honoring their personal experiences with real questions). 
                The resulting mix of warmth and challenge can be especially motivating (Goldstein, 1999). When warmth and challenge are both present in a discussion, it sometimes even becomes possible to do what may at first seem risky: calling on individual students randomly without the students‚Äô vo
                Helping Students to Articulate their Ideas and Thinking
                The classroom talk register is well designed to help students articulate ideas and thoughts, particularly when used in the context of discussion. 
                In addition to the conversational probes, like the ones described in the previous section, there are other ways to support students in expressing their ideas fully and clearly. 
                One way is for the teacher to check repeatedly on her own understanding of students‚Äô contributions as a discussion unfolds.
                Consider this exchange:

                Student (during a class discussion): It seems to me that we all need to learn more about climate change.

                Teacher: What do you mean by ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù? It‚Äôs a big topic; what parts of it are you thinking about?
                Still another strategy for helping students to articulate their ideas is to increase the wait time between when the teacher asks a question and when the teacher expects a student to answer.
                As was pointed out earlier, wait times that are longer than average - longer than one second - give students more time to formulate ideas and therefore to express themselves more completely and precisely (Good & Brophy, 2002). 
                In addition, longer wait times have the added advantage of indirection: instead of telling a student to say more, the teacher needs only to wait for the student to say more.
                In general any communication strategy will help students become more articulate if it both allows and invites further comment and elaboration on their ideas. 
                Taken together, the invitations closely resemble a description of class discussion, though they can actually be used singly at any time during teaching.
                Consider these possible conversational moves:

                    The teacher asks the student to explain his initial idea more completely.
                    The teacher rephrases a comment made by a student.
                    The teacher compares the student‚Äôs idea to another, related idea, and asks the student to comment. 
                    The teacher asks for evidence supporting the student‚Äôs idea.
                    Promoting Academic Risk-Taking and Problem Solving
                    For various reasons students may sometimes avoid such risks as attempting a solution to a problem, especially if he or she has sometimes failed at a task in the past, and is therefore concerned about negative evaluations again (Hope & Oliver, 2005).
                    What can a teacher say or do to counteract such hesitation? There are several strategies, all of which involve focusing attention on the process of doing an activity rather than on its outcome or evaluation.
                    Click the following tabs to further explore the concept of promoting academic risk-taking and problem solving:
                    Intrinsic Interest
                    Where possible, call attention to the intrinsic interest or satisfaction of an activity. For example, consider an elementary-level activity of writing a Japanese haiku - a poem with exactly seventeen syllables.
                    This activity can be satisfying in itself, regardless of how it is evaluated. Casually reminding individuals of this fact can contribute to the students' sense of ease about writing the haiku and encourage them indirectly to do better work.
                    Minimize the Importance of Grades

                    Give Students Time
                    The main points from this module are as follows:
                        Mixing "test" questions with real questions is an example of mixing instruction with conversation. This is a good strategy for finding out if a student understands you.
                        Cold Calling: Calling on individual students randomly for an answer to a question, without the students' volunteering to speak.
                        A zone of proximal development has two important features: stimulating students' thinking and creating a supportive and caring atmosphere.
                        One way of supporting students in expressing their ideas fully and clearly is to repeatedly check on your own understanding of students' contributions while a discussion unfolds. 
                        Another way of helping a student to articulate their answer is to increase their wait time. Focusing attention on the process of doing an activity rather than on its outcome is a good strategy to get students to see less of a risk with a problem. 
                        Some ways of doing this are:
                        After completing this module you will be able to:
                            Select the general learning goals for your class
                            Understand the foundation of national standards
                            Structure and correctly use a curriculum framework and curriculum guide
                            Instructional Planning for Successful Teaching
                            Education has purposes, goals, and objectives. A central task of teaching is to know what these are and to transform the most general goals into specific objectives and tasks for students. 
                            A lot of the clarification and specification of goals needs to happen before a cycle of instruction actually begins, but the benefits of planning happen throughout all phases of teaching. 
                            If students know precisely what they are supposed to learn, they can focus their attention and effort more effectively. If the teacher knows precisely what students are supposed to learn, then the teacher can make better use of class time and choose and design assessments of their learning that are more fair and valid. In the long run everyone benefits.

                            At the most general or abstract level, the goals of education include important philosophical ideas like ‚Äúdeveloping individuals to their fullest potential‚Äù and ‚Äúpreparing students to be productive members of society‚Äù. 
                            Few teachers would disagree with these ideas in principle, though they might disagree about their wording or about their relative importance. 
                            As a practical matter, however, teachers might have trouble translating such generalities into specific lesson plans or activities for the next day‚Äôs class. 
                            Does it mean, for example, that a language arts teacher should ask students to write an essay about their personal interests, or does it mean that the teacher should help students learn to write as well as possible on any topic, even ones that are not of immediate interest? 
                            What exactly should a teacher do, from day to day, to ‚Äúprepare students to be productive members of society‚Äù as well? 

                            Answers to questions like these are needed to plan instruction effectively. But the answers are not obvious simply by examining statements of general educational goal


                    The teacher asks the student how confident he is in his idea.
                    The teacher asks another student to comment on the first student‚Äôs idea.

                Curriculum Framework
                The terms curriculum framework and curriculum guide are sometimes used almost interchangeably, but for convenience they will be referred to as two distinct kinds of documents.
                The more general of the two is curriculum framework, which is a document that explains how content standards can or should be organized for a particular subject and at various grade levels. 
                Sometimes this information is referred to as the scope and sequence for a curriculum. A curriculum framework document is like a standards statement in that it does not usually provide a lot of detailed suggestions for daily teaching. 
                It differs from a standards statement, though, in that it analyzes each general standard in a curriculum into more specific skills that students need to learn, often a dozen or more per standard. 
                The language or terminology of a framework statement also tends to be somewhat more concrete than a standards statement, in the sense that it is more likely to name behaviors of students - things that a teacher might see them do or hear them say.
                Sometimes, but not always, it may suggest ways for assessing whether students have in fact acquired each skill listed in the document.
                In this case the framework explains the state standards for learning to read, and the example illustrates how one particular standard, that ‚Äústudents speak and write with command of English conventions appropriate to this grade level‚Äù, is broken into nine more specific skills. Note also that the excerpt names observable behaviors of students. Click on the following tabs to explore a curriculum framework.

                Curriculum Guide
                A teacher's need for detailed activity suggestions is more likely to be met by a curriculum guide - a document devoted to graphic descriptions of activities that foster or encourage the specific skills explained in a curriculum framework document. 
                The descriptions may mention or list curriculum goals served by an activity, but they are also likely to specify materials that a teacher needs; time requirements, requirements for grouping students, drawings or diagrams of key equipment or materials, and sometimes even suggestions for what to say to students at different points during the activity. 
                In these ways the descriptions may resemble lesson plans.


                Since classroom activities often support more than one specific skill, activities in a curriculum guide may be organized differently than they might be in a framework document. 
                Instead of highlighting only one standard at a time, as the framework document might, activities may be grouped more loosely - for exampl

                What to Do
                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Having learning goals is the first step in instructional planning for a teacher, without goals students and teachers are in danger of getting lost in regards to their learning.
                    In the United States, organizations that represent educators have proposed national standards for what students should be expected to learn at different grade levels. This takes out some of the work of creating learning goals for teachers. 
                    Curriculum frameworks and curriculum guides are good templates for more specific learning goals.
                    Curriculum framework -  A document that explains how content standards can or should be organized for a particular subject, at various grade levels.
                    Curriculum guide - A document devoted to graphic description of activities that foster/encourage the specific skills explained in curriculum framework document. 

                Selecting Content Topics
                Given curriculum frameworks and guides like the ones described previously, how do you choose and formulate actual learning objectives? 
                Basically there are two approaches:
                Start by selecting topics that you want students to know (the cognitive approach)
                Start with what you want students to do (the behavioral approach)
                In effect the cognitive approach moves from the general to the specific, and the behavioral approach does the opposite. Each approach has advocates, as well as inherent strengths and problems. In practice, teachers often combine or alternate between them in order to give students some of the advantages of each.
                onsider this example from teaching middle-school biology. For this subject you might have a general goal like the following, with accompanying indicators.
                Goal: The students will understand the nature and purpose of photosynthesis
                Indicators:

                    Explains the purpose of photosynthesis and steps in the process.
                    Diagrams steps in the chemical process.
                    Describes how plant photosynthesis affects the animal world.
                    Writes a plan for how to test leaves for presence of photosynthesis.
                    Makes an oral presentation and explains how the experiment was conducte
                    Using a strictly cognitive approach to planning, therefore, a teacher‚Äôs job has two parts.  First she must identify, find, or choose a manageable number of general goals - perhaps a half dozen or so. (Sometimes these can be taken or adapted from a curriculum framework document.) 
                    Then the teacher must think of a handful of specific examples or behavioral indicators for each goal - a half dozen or so of these as well. The behavioral indicators clarify the meaning of the general goal, but are not meant to be the only way that students might show success at learning.
                    Then, at last, thoughtful planning for individual lessons or activities can begin. 
                    This approach works especially well for learning goals that are relatively long-term, that is, goals that take many lessons, days, or weeks to reach. During such long periods of teaching, it is impossible to specify the exact, detailed behaviors that every student can or should display to prove that he or she has reached a general goal. 
                    It is possible, however, to specify general directions toward which all students should focus their learning and to explain the nature of the goals with a sample of well-chosen indicators or examples (Popham, 200
                    Taxonomies of Educational Objectives
                    When educators have proposed taxonomies of educational objectives, they have tended to focus on one of three areas or domains of psychological functioning:
                        Students' cognition (thoughts)
                        Students' feelings and emotions (affect)
                        Students' physical skills (psychomotor abilities)
                    Of these three areas, they have tended to focus the most attention on cognition. The taxonomy originated by Benjamin Bloom, for example, deals entirely with cognitive outcomes of instruction.

                Bloom's Taxonomy: Taxonomy of Cognitive Objectives
                In its original form, Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy of educational objectives referred to forms of cognition or thinking, which were divided into the six levels of learning (Bloom, et al., 1956).

                    Knowledge
                    Recall of information, whether it is simple or complex in nature.
                    Simple example: 
                    ‚ÄúName three things that Goldilocks did in the house of the three bears.‚Äù
                    Classroom examples: 
                    ‚ÄúList all of the planets of the solar system.‚Äù
                    ‚ÄúState five key features of life in the middle ages.‚Äù
                    Comprehension





                    Application
                    Bloom's Taxonomy
                    The levels form a loose hierarchy from simple to complex thinking, at least when applied to some subjects and topics. When planning for these subjects it can therefore be helpful not only for insuring diversity among learning objectives, but also for sequencing materials. 
                    In learning about geography, for example, it may sometimes make sense to begin with information about specific places or societies (knowledge and comprehension), and work gradually toward comparisons and assessments among the places or societies (analysis and synthesis).
                    Such a sequence does not work well, however, for all possible topics or subjects. To learn certain topics in mathematics, for example, students may sometimes need to start with general ideas (like ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to multiply?‚Äù) than with specific facts (like ‚ÄúHow much is 4 x 6?‚Äù) (Egan, 2005). 

                    At other times, though, the reverse sequence may be preferable. Whatever the case, a taxonomy of cognitive objectives, like Bloom‚Äôs, can help to remind teachers to set a variety of objectives and to avoid relying excessively on just one level, such as simple recall of factual knowledge (Notar, et al., 200

                Bloom's Taxonomy Revised
                Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy was revised by two of his original colleagues so as to clarify its terms and to make it more complete (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001; Marzano, 2006).

                As the chart shows, several categories of objectives have been renamed and a second dimension added that describes the kind of thinking or cognitive processing that may occur. 
                The result is a much richer taxonomy than before, since every level of the objectives can now take four different forms. 
                For example, remembering can refer to four different kinds of memory: 

                    Memory for facts
                    Memory for concepts

                Taxonomies of Psychomotor Objectives
                Taxonomies related to abilities and skills that are physical, or psychomotor, have also been used less widely than affective taxonomies, with the notable exception of one area of teaching where they are obviously relevant: physical education. 
                As you might expect, taxonomic categories of motor skills extend from simple, brief actions to complex, extended action sequences that combine simpler, previously learned skills smoothly and automatically (Harrow, 1972; Simpson, 1972). 
                An example of a very basic psychomotor skill might be imitating the action of throwing a ball when modeled by someone else; an example of a more complex motor skill might be performing a 10 minute gymnastics routine which the student has devised for himself or herself. 
                Note, though, that many examples of psychomotor skills also exist outside the realm of physical education. In a science course, for example, a student might need to learn to operate laboratory equipment that requires using delicate, fine movements. In art classes, students might learn to draw, and in music they might learn to play an instrument (both are partly motor skills).
                Most first graders are challenged by the motor skills of learning to write. For students with certain
                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    The cognitive approach to formulating educational outcomes focuses on selecting content that you want students to know.
                    The behaviorist approach focuses on what you want the students to do.

                A compromise between the two can be reached, some examples of this are:

                    Thinking about both long-term goals, and short-term objectives.
                    Include both general and specific goals in your planning.
                    Planning for what the students do, not what the teacher does. 

                When educators have proposed taxonomies of educational objectives, they have tended to focus on one of three areas or domains of psychological functioning: 

                    Students' cognition (thought)

                        Differentiated Instruction
                        So far variety among students has been ignored. Yet their diversity is a reality that every teacher recognizes. Whatever goals and plans are made, some students learn the material sooner or better than others.
                        For any given goal or objective, some students need more time than others in order to learn. And any particular teaching strategy will prove more effective with some students than others. 

                        Effective teaching requires differentiated instruction - providing different materials, arrangements, and strategies with different students. The differentiation can include unique structural arrangements in the school, such as special tutoring for individuals or special classes for small groups needing particular extra help. 
                        Differentiation can also include extra attention or coaching within
                        Response to Intervention
                        One of the more widely used approaches for differentiating instruction is called response to intervention (or RTI). Like other forms of differentiation, RTI begins with the premise that students differ widely in how they learn and the extent of their learning. 
                        It also assumes that a central part of teaching is to respond to these differences, and to do so as promptly as possible. To achieve this purpose, RTI programs typically frame educational interventions around three levels called tiers. Click on the following tabs to further explore these tiers.
                        Tier 1

                        Tier 1 instruction involves efforts to teach an entire class in the most effective ways - ways that are good bets for being effective with the majority of students. Using Tier 1 strategies, for example, a teacher might sometimes explain new ideas to the whole class, but also put students into small groups for selected projects and give them individual seat work or homework to do. 
                        a classroom for individual students or small groups (Tomlinson, 2006; Goddard, Goddard, & Tschannen-Moran, 2007).

                Students as a Source of Instructional Goals
                The discussion of instructional planning so far has described goals and objectives as if they are selected primarily by educators and teachers, and not by students themselves. The assumption may be correct in many cases, but there are problems with it. 
                One problem is that choosing goals and objectives for students, rather than by students, places a major burden on everyone involved in education - curriculum writers, teachers, and students.

                The curriculum writers have to make sure that they specify standards, goals, and objectives that are truly important for students to learn (what if it really does not matter, for example, whether a science student learns about the periodic table of the elements?). 

                Teachers have to make sure that students actually become motivated to learn the specified goals and objectives, even if the students are not motivated initially. 
                Students have to master pre-set goals and objectives even if they might not have chosen them personally. 
                Some critics of education have argued that these requirements can be serious impediments to learning (Kohn, 2004). The problems are widespread and especially noticeable in two forms of teaching. 
                One is with the youngest students, who may especially lack patience with an educational agenda set by others (Kohn, 1999; Seitz, 2006). 
                The other is with culturally diverse classrooms, where students and their families may hold a variety of legitimate, but unconventional expectations about what they should learn (J. Banks & C. Banks, 2005).
                In response to concerns like these, some educators advocate planning instruction around goals set or expressed either by students themselves or by the cultures or communities with which students identify. 
                Their suggestions vary in detail, but can be organized into two broad categories:

                    Emergent Curriculum
                    Multi-Cultural and Anti-Bias Education
                    A culture is an all-encompassing set of values, beliefs, practices and customs of a group or community - its total way of life. Cultures may be shared widely, even by much if not all of an entire nation, or they may be shared by relatively few, such as a small community within a large city. 
                    Sometimes the term culture is even applied to the way of life of an individual family or of a specialized group in society; some might argue, for example, that there is a culture of schooling shared by teachers, though not necessarily by all students.
                    Because culture by definition touches on all aspects of living, it is likely to affect students‚Äô perspectives about school, their ways of learning and their motivations to learn. The differences go beyond obvious differences in holidays, language, or food preferences.
                        In some cultures, for example, individuals keep good eye contact with someone to whom they are speaking, and expect the same from others. In other cultures, such behavior is considered intrusive or overly aggressive, and avoiding eye contact while speaking is considered more respectful.
                        Or another example: in some cultures it is expected that individuals will be punctual (or on time), whereas in others punctuality is considered overly compulsive, and a more casual approach to time is the norm. 
                        The main points from this module are as follows:
                            The diversity and different interests of students should have a direct impact on the educational goals set out by you the teacher. 
                            Differentiated Instruction provides different materials, arrangements and strategies for different students.
                            Response to Intervention (RTI) is one of the more widely used approaches of differentiation instruction.
                            Tier 1 instruction involves efforts to teach an entire class in the most effective ways
                            Tier 2 instruction involves additional time or materials for the students who do not learn from Tier 1.
                            Tier 3 instruction involves special classes or individual tutoring outside of the classroom and is reserved for the students who do not learn from Tier 
                    Multicultural and anti-bias curriculum

                    Emergent curriculum explicitly builds on interests expressed by students. 
                    Emergent curriculums are particularly effective methods for early childhood education.
                    Students will be more motivated to learn with an emergent curriculum because they want to know more about the topic.

                        Multicultural education focuses both on understanding the differences among cultures, and on overcoming social prejudices and biases resulting from cultural differences.

                        Content integration - curriculum uses examples from different cultures to illustrate ideas already in the curriculum.
                        Prejudice reduction - activities that identify students‚Äô negative evaluations of cultural groups
                        Knowledge construction - unstated, unconscious process by which a cultural group creates knowledge or information.
                        Equity pedagogy - allowing/encouraging a variety of learning style

                Enhancing Student Learning
                Whether instructional goals originate from curriculum documents, students‚Äô expressed interests, or a mixture of both, students are more likely to achieve the goals if teachers draw on a wide variety of resources. 
                As a practical matter, this means looking for materials and experiences that supplement - or occasionally even replace - the most traditional forms of information, such as textbooks. 
                Precisely what resources to use depend on factors unique to each class, school, or community, but they might include one or more of those studied in this mo
                The Internet as a Learning Tool
                The Internet has become a fixture of modern society, and it offers a huge variety of information on virtually any topic, including any school subject and any possible grade level from kindergarten through university. 
                Internet access is now widespread in the developed world, and is becoming increasingly more accessible in the developing world. These circumstances make the Internet a potential major resource for teachers and students - a virtual library many times larger than even the largest physical (or ‚Äúbricks and mortar‚Äù) libraries in the world.
                Service Learning
                Still another way to enhance learning is to incorporate service learning, which is activity that combines real community service with analysis and reflection on the significance of the service (Johnson & O‚ÄôGrady, 2006; Thomsen, 2006).
                Picking up trash in an urban stream bed, for example, is a community service which students can perform. 
                To transform this service into service learning, students also need to note and reflect on the trash that they find; talk and write about the ecological environment of the stream and of the community; and even make recommendations for improving the local environme

                Morally and Intellectually
                Issues
                Successful When Done Well
                To accomplish these objectives, service learning activities should not be sporadic, nor used as a punishment - as when a teacher or principal assigns trash pick-up as an after-school detention activity.
                Under good conditions, service learning enhances instructional plans both morally and intellectually.
                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Using a wide variety of resources is recommended to enhance students' learning. 
                    The internet is a wealth of information and so, is a major resource for teachers and students alike, although drawbacks include difficulty in finding relevant information and inequity of access. 
                    Bringing local experts to the classroom and bringing the class on field trips outside the classroom both help to make learning more vivid and more relevant to the particular community and lives that students lead. 
                    Service learning - activity that combines real community service with analysis and reflection on the significance of the service.

                    Anticipate preconceptions of students and respectfully remove misconceptions
                    Help students make the transition from practice that is relatively guided to practice that is relatively independent

                Creating Bridges among Curriculum Goals and Students' Prior Experiences
                To succeed instructional plans require a variety of resources, like the ones discussed in the previous module. But they also require more: they need to connect with students‚Äô prior experiences and knowledge.

                Sometimes the connections can develop as a result of using the Internet, taking field trips, or engaging in service learning, particularly if students are already familiar with these activities and places. 
                More often than not, though, teachers need to find additional ways to connect curriculum with students‚Äô experiences - ways that fit more thoroughly and continuously into the daily work of a class.
                Fortunately, such techniques are readily at hand; they simply require the teacher to develop a habit of looking for opportunities to use them. 
                Among the possibilities are four that deserve special mention: 

                    Modeling behavior and modeling representations of ideas.
                    Activating prior knowledge already familiar to students.
                    Anticipating preconceptions held by students.
                    Providing guided and independent practice.

                Modeling
                The term modeling can mean either a demonstration of a desired behavior or a representation of an important theory, idea, or object. Each of these meanings can link
                Modeling as Demonstration
                In the first meaning, modeling refers to performing or demonstrating a desired new behavior or skill, as when a teacher or classmate demonstrates polite behaviors or the correct solution to a math problem. 
                In this case the teacher or classmate models the desired behavior, either deliberately or in the course of other ongoing activity. Students observe the modeled behavior and (hopefully) imitate it themselves. 
                Research repeatedly shows that modeling desired behaviors is an effective way to learn new behaviors, especially when the model is perceived as important (like the teacher), similar to the learner (like a student‚Äôs best friend), or has a warm, positive relationship with the learner (like the teacher or the student‚Äôs friend) (Bandura, 2002; Gibson, 2004). 
                Modeling in this sense is sometimes also called observational learning. It has many of the same properties as the classic operant conditioning, except that reinforcement during observational learning is witnessed in others rather than experienced by the learner
                Activating Prior Knowledge
                Another way to connect curriculum goals to students‚Äô experience is by activating prior knowledge, a term that refers to encouraging students to recall what they know already about new material being learned. Various formats for activating prior knowledge are possible. 
                When introducing a unit about how biologists classify animal and plant species, for example, a teacher can invite students to discuss how they already classify different kinds of plants and animals.
                Having highlighted this informal knowledge, the teacher can then explore how the same species are classified by biological scientists, and compare the scientists‚Äô classification schemes to the students‚Äô own schemes. 
                The activation does not have to happen orally, as in the previous example; a teacher can also ask students to write down as many distinct types of animals and plants that they can think of, and then ask students to diagram or map their relationships - essentially creating a concept map. 
                Whatever the strategy used, activation helps by making students‚Äô prior knowledge or experience conscious and therefore easier to link to new concepts or information.
                directly. Watching others being reinforced is sometimes called vicarious reinforcement.
                Anticipating Preconceptions of Students
                Ironically, activating students‚Äô prior knowledge can be a mixed blessing if some of the prior knowledge is misleading or downright wrong. Misleading or erroneous knowledge is especially common among young students, but it can happen at any grade level.
                A kindergarten child may think that the sun literally ‚Äúrises‚Äù in the morning, since she often hears adults use this expression, or that the earth is flat because it obviously looks flat. 
                But a high school student may mistakenly believe that large objects (a boulder) fall faster than small ones (a pebble), or that a heavy object dropped (not thrown) from a moving car window will fall straight down instead of traveling laterally alongside the car while it falls.
                Because misconceptions are quite common among students and even among adults, teachers are more effective if they can anticipate preconceptions of students wherever possible. The task is twofold. Click on the following tabs to explore how to dissolve misconceptions.

                Respecting Students
                Respecting Students - Part 2
                First the teacher must know or at least guess students‚Äô preconceptions as much as possible in advance, so that she can design learning activities to counteract and revise their thinking. 
                Some preconceptions have been well-documented by educational research and therefore can in principle be anticipated easily - though they may still sometimes take a teacher by surprise during a busy activity or lesson (Tanner & Allen, 2005; Chiu & Lin, 2005). 
                Common Misconceptions about Science
                Click on the following tabs to explore common misconceptions held by students about science, along with some actions that you, as the teacher, can carry out to remove these misconceptions, while treating them with respect (Chi, 2005; D. Clark, 2006; Slotta & Chi, 2006; Owens, 2003 ).
                1
                Misconception: Stars and constellations appear in the same place in the sky every night.
                Solution: Ask students to observe carefully the locations of a bright star once a week for several weeks.
                2
                Creating Bridges among Curriculum Goals and Students' Prior Knowledge
                So far, bridging the goals or content of a curriculum to events, beliefs, and ideas from students‚Äô lives has been the main focus. 
                In studying human growth in a health class, for example, a teacher might ask students to bring photos of themselves as a much younger child. In this case a concept from the curriculum - human growth - is then related to a personal event, being photographed as a youngster, which the student finds meaningful.
                Guided Practice, Independent Practice and Homework
                But teachers can also create bridges between curriculum and students‚Äô experiences in another way, by relating the process of learning in school with the process of learning outside of school. 
                Much of this task involves helping students to make the transition from supervised learning to self-regulated learning - or put differently, from practice that is relatively guided to practice that is relatively independent.
                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Instructional plans are more likely to succeed if they connect between with students' prior experiences and knowledge.
                    Some of the ways to make these connections are:
                    Modeling behavior and modeling representations of ideas.
                    Activating prior knowledge already familiar to students.
                    Anticipating preconceptions held by students.
                    Providing guided and independent practice, including its most traditional form, homework.

                        Student Motivation
                        Differences in motivation are an important source of diversity in classrooms, comparable in importance to differences in prior knowledge, ability, or developmental readiness.  
                        When it comes to school learning, furthermore, students‚Äô motivations take on special importance because students‚Äô mere presence in class is (of course) no guarantee that students really want to learn. It is only a sign that students live in a society requiring young people to attend school.
                        Since modern education is compulsory, teachers cannot take students‚Äô motivation for granted, and th

                Behaviorism
                Sometimes it is useful to think of motivation not as something ‚Äúinside‚Äù a student driving the student‚Äôs behavior, but as equivalent to the student‚Äôs outward behaviors. This is the perspective of behaviorism, which is sometimes used as a way to think about the learning process.
                In its most thorough-going form, behaviorism focuses almost completely on what can be directly seen or heard about a person‚Äôs behavior, and has relatively few comments about what may lie behind (or ‚Äúunderneath‚Äù or ‚Äúinside‚Äù) the behavior.
                When it comes to motivation, this perspective means minimizing or even ignoring the distinction between the inner drive or energy of students, and the outward behaviors that express the drive or energy. The two are considered the same, or nearly so.
                Equating the inner and the outward might seem to violate common sense. How can a student do something without some sort of feeling or thought to make the action happen?
                This very question has led to alternative models of motivation that are based on cognitive rather than behaviorist theories of learning. However, considering the advantages of a behaviorist perspective on
                Sometimes the circumstances of teaching can limit teachers‚Äô opportunities to distinguish between inner motivation and outward behavior. Certainly teachers see plenty of student behaviors - signs of motivation of some sort. 
                But the multiple demands of teaching can limit the time needed to determine what the behaviors mean. If a student asks a lot of questions during discussions, for example, is he or she curious about the material itself, or just wanting to look intelligent in front of classmates and the teacher? 
                In a class with many students and a busy agenda, there may not be a lot of time for a teacher to decide between these possibilities. In other cases, the problem may not be limited time as much as communication difficulties with a student.
                Consider a student who is still learning English, or who belongs to a cultural community that uses patterns of conversation that are unfamiliar to the teacher, or who has a disability that limits the student‚Äôs general language skill. 
                In these cases discerning the student‚Äôs inner motivations may take more time and effort. It is important to invest the extra time and effort for such students, but while a teacher is doing so, it is also im

                The most common version of the behavioral perspective on motivation is the theory of operant conditioning associated with B. F. Skinner (1938, 1957).
                 The description sometimes focuses on behavioral learning, but the same operant model can be transformed into an account of motivation. 
                In the operant model a behavior being learned (the ‚Äúoperant‚Äù) increases in frequency or likelihood because performing it makes a reinforcement available. 
                To understand this model in terms of motivation, think of the likelihood of response as the motivation and the reinforcement as the motivator. 
                Imagine, for example, that a student learns by operant conditioning to answer questions during class discussions: each time the student answers a question (the operant), the teacher praises (reinforces) this behavior.
                In addition to thinking of this situation as behavioral learning, however, you can also think of it in terms of motivation: the likelihood of the student answering questions (the motivation) is increasing because of the teacher‚Äôs praise (the motivator). 
                Click on the following tabs to explore the concept of operant conditioning reframed in terms of motivation.
                Operant
                In terms of learning the concept of an operant is phrased as behavior that becomes more likely because of reinforcement. In terms of motivation, however, it can be phrased as behavior that suggests an increase in motivation. 
                In the classroom an example of this would be a student listening to the teacher‚Äôs comments during lecture or discussion.

                Positive Reinforcement
                Cautions about Behavioral Perspectives on Motivation
                As was mentioned, behaviorist perspectives about motivation do reflect a classroom reality: that teachers sometimes lack time and therefore must focus simply on students‚Äô appropriate outward behavior. But there are nonetheless cautions about adopting this view.
                An obvious one is the ambiguity of students‚Äô specific behaviors; what looks like a sign of one motive to the teacher may in fact be a sign of some other motive to the student (DeGrandpre, 2000). 

                    If a student looks at the teacher intently while she is speaking, does it mean the student is motivated to learn, or only that the student is daydreaming? 
                    If a student invariably looks away while the teacher is speaking, does it mean that the student is disrespectful of the teacher, or that student comes from a family or cultural group where avoiding eye contact actually shows more respect for a speaker than direct ey

                Another concern about behaviorist perspectives, including operant conditioning, is that it leads teachers to ignore students‚Äô choices and preferences, and to ‚Äúplay God‚Äù by making choices on their behalf (Kohn, 1996).
                According to this criticism, the distinction between ‚Äúinner‚Äù motives and expressions of motives in outward behavior does not disappear just because a teacher (or a psychological theory) chooses to treat a motive and the behavioral expression of a motive as equivalent
                tudents usually do know what they want or desire, and their wants or desires may not always correspond to what a teacher chooses to reinforce or ignore. This is the issue of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. Approaches that are exclusively behavioral, it is argued, are not sensitive enough to students‚Äô intrinsic, self-sustaining motivations.
                There is truth to this allegation if a teacher actually does rely on rewarding behaviors that she alone has chosen, or even if she persists in reinforcing behaviors that students already find motivating without external reinforcement. 

                In those cases reinforcements can backfire: instead of serving as an incentive to desired behavior, reinforcement can become a reminder of the teacher‚Äôs power and of students‚Äô lack of control over their own actions. 
                classic research study of intrinsic motivation illustrated the problem nicely. In the study, researchers rewarded university students for two activities - solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines - that they already found interesting. Some of the students, however, were paid to do these activities, whereas others were not. 
                Under these conditions, the students who were paid were less likely to engage in the activities following the experiment than were the students who were not paid, even though both groups had been equally interested in the activities to begin with (Deci, 1971). 
                The extrinsic reward of payment, it seemed, interfered with the intrinsic reward of working the puzz
                Goals as a Motivation
                One way motives vary is by the kind of goals that students set for themselves, and by how the goals support students‚Äô academic achievement. 
                As you might suspect, some goals encourage academic achievement more than others, but even motives that do not concern academics explicitly tend to affect learning indirectly.
                What kinds of achievement goals do students hold? Imagine three individuals, Maria, Sara, and Lindsay, who are taking algebra together. Click on the following tabs to explore the concept of achievement goals.
                Maria
                Sara
                Lindsay
                Maria‚Äôs main concern is to learn the material as well as possible because she finds it interesting and because she believes it will be useful to her in later courses, perhaps at university. Hers is a mastery goal because she wants primarily to learn or master the material. 
                Goals that Contribute to Motivation
                As you might imagine, mastery, performance, and performance-avoidance goals often are not experienced in pure form, but in combinations.
                If you play the clarinet in the school band, you might want to improve your technique simply because you enjoy playing as well as possible - essentially a mastery orientation. But you might also want to look talented in the eyes of classmates - a performance orientation. Another part of what you may wish, at least privately, is to avoid looking like a complete failure at playing the clarinet.
                One of these motives may predominate over the others, but they all may be present.
                Mastery Goals
                Mastery goals tend to be associated with enjoyment of learning the material at hand, and in this sense represent an outcome that teachers often seek for students. By definition therefore they are a form of intrinsic motivation. 
                As such mastery goals have been found to be better than performance goals at sustaining students‚Äô interest in a subject. 
                In one review of research about learning goals, for example, students with primarily mastery orientations toward a course they were taking not only tended to express greater interest in the course, but also continued to express interest well beyond the official end of the course, and to enroll in further courses in the same subject (Harackiewicz, et al., 2002; Wolters, 2004).
                Performance Goals
                Performance goals, on the other hand, imply extrinsic motivation, and tend to show the mixed effects of this orientation. A positive effect is that students with a performance orientation do tend to get higher grades than those who express primarily a mastery orientation. 
                The advantage in grades occurs both in the short term (with individual assignments) and in the long term (with overall grade point average when graduating). 
                But there is evidence that performance-oriented students do not actually learn material as deeply or permanently as students who are more mastery oriented (Midgley, Kaplan, & Middleton, 2001). 
                A possible reason is that measures of performance - such as test scores - often reward relatively shallow memorization of information and therefore guide performance-oriented students away from processing the information thoughtfully or deeply.
                Another possible reason is that a performance orientation, by focusing on gaining recognition as the best among peers, encourages competition among peers. Giving and receiving help from classmates is thus not in the self-interest of a performance-oriented student, and the resulting isolation limits the student‚Äôs learning.
                ncouraging Mastery Goals
                Even though a degree of performance orientation may be inevitable in school because of the mere presence of classmates, it does not have to take over students‚Äô academic motivation completely. 
                Teachers can encourage mastery goals in various ways, and should in fact do so because a mastery orientation leads to more sustained, thoughtful learning, at least in classrooms, where classmates may sometimes debate and disagree with each other (Darnon, Butera, & Harackiewicz, 2006).
                How can teachers do so? One way is to allow students to choose specific tasks or assignments for themselves, where possible, because their choices are more likely than usual to reflect prior personal interests, and hence be motivated more intrinsically than usual. 
                The limitation of this strategy, of course, is that students may not see some of the connections between their prior interests and the curriculum topics at hand. In that case it also helps for the teacher to look for and point out the relevance of current topics or skills to students‚Äô personal interests and goals.
                Goals that Affect Achievement Indirectly
                As was mentioned, failure-avoidant goals by nature undermine academic achievement. Often they are a negative byproduct of the competitiveness of performance goals (Urdan, 2004). 
                If a teacher (and sometimes also fellow students) put too much emphasis on being the best in the class, and if interest in learning the material as such therefore suffers, then some students may decide that success is beyond their reach or may not be desirable in any case. The alternative - simply avoiding failure - may seem wiser as well as more feasible.

                Once a student adopts this attitude, he or she may underachieve more or less deliberately, doing only the minimum work necessary to avoid looking foolish or to avoid serious conflict with the teacher. 
                Avoiding failure in this way is an example of self-handicapping - deliberate actions and choices that the reduce chances of success. Students may self-handicap in a number of ways; in addition to not working hard, they may procrastinate about completing assignments, for example, or set goals that are unrealistically high.
                Social Goals
                Most students need and value relationships, both with classmates and with teachers, and often (though not always) they get a good deal of positive support from the relationships. But the effects of social relationships are complex, and at times can work both for and against academic achievement. 
                If a relationship with the teacher is important and reasonably positive, then the student is likely to try pleasing the teacher by working hard on assignments (Dowson & Mclnerney, 2003). Note, though, that this effect is closer to performance than mastery; the student is primarily concerned about looking good to someone else.
                If, on the other hand, a student is especially concerned about relationships with peers, the effects on achievement depend on the student‚Äôs motives for the relationship, as well as on peers‚Äô attitudes. 
                Desiring to be close to peers personally may lead a student to ask for help from, and give help to peers - a behavior that may support higher achievement, at least up to a point. 
                But desiring to impress peers with skills and knowledge may lead to the oppo
                The abilities and achievement motivation of peers themselves can also make a difference, but once again the effects vary depending on the context. 
                Low achievement and motivation by peers affects an individual‚Äôs academic motivation more in elementary school than in high school, more in learning mathematics than learning to read, and more if there is a wide range of abilities in a classroom than if there is a more narrow range (Burke & Sass, 2006).
                In spite of these complexities, social relationships are valued so highly by most students that teachers should generally facilitate them, though also keep an eye on their nature and their consequent effects on achievement. Many assignments can be accomplished productively in groups, for example, as long as the groups are formed thoughtfully.
                Relationships can also be supported with activities that involve students or adults from another class or from outside the school, as often happens with school or community service projects. These can provide considerable social satisfaction and can sometimes be connected to current curriculum needs (Butin, 2005). 
                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Behaviorism: thinking of motivation not as something ‚Äúinside‚Äù a student driving their behavior, but as equivalent to their outward behavior.
                    Operant conditioning can be reframed in terms of motivation, by thinking of answering the question as the motivation, and of the teacher as the motivator. 
                    If teaching from the behaviorist perspective, it is important to remember that what looks like a sign of one motive to the teacher may easily be a sign of a different motive to the student.
                    As extrinsic rewards often seem to undermine intrinsic motivation, they should be used selectively and thoughtfully.
                    Mastery goals are a form of intrinsic motivation, when a student wishes to learn or master new material.
                    Performance goals are a form of extrinsic motivation, when a student wishes to look successful, and perform well in the eyes of peers and teachers.
                    After completing this module you will be able to:
                        Understand how a student‚Äôs interests can affect their learning and motivation
                        Generate interest in a topic to help students get motivated
                        Understand different attributions about success and failure, and how they affect a student's motivation

                        Provide appropriate conditions for students to learn
                        Interest as Motivation
                        In addition to holding different kinds of goals - with consequent differences in academic motivation - students show obvious differences in levels of interest in the topics and tasks of the classroom. 
                        Suppose that two high school classmates, Frank and Jason, both are taking chemistry, and specifically learning how to balance chemical equations. Click on the following tabs to explore this example.
                        Frank
                        Jason
                        Frank finds the material boring and has to force himself to study it; as a result he spends only the time needed to learn the basic material and to complete the assignments at a basic level.


                Frank‚Äôs learning is based on effort compared to Jason‚Äôs, whose learning is based more fully on interest. As the example implies, when students learn from interest they tend to devote more attention to the topic than if they learn from effort (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). 
                The finding is not surprising since interest is another aspect of intrinsic motivation - energy or drive that comes from within.
                A distinction between effort and interest is often artificial, however, because the two motives often get blended or combined in students‚Äô personal experiences. 
                Most people can remember times when they worked at a skill that they enjoyed and found interesting, but that also required effort to learn. The challenge for teachers is therefore to draw on and encourage students‚Äô interest as much as possible, and thus keep the required effort within reasonable bounds - neither too hard nor too easy.
                Situational Interest versus Personal Interest
                Students‚Äô interests vary in how deeply or permanently they are located within students. Situational interests are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation. Unusual sights, sounds, or words can stimulate situational interest.
                A teacher might show an interesting image on the overhead projector, or play a brief bit of music, or make a surprising comment in passing. At a more abstract level, unusual or surprising topics of discussion can also arouse interest when they are first introduced.
                Personal interests are relatively permanent preferences of the student, and are usually expressed in a variety of situations. In the classroom, a student may (or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. 
                Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular no
                Benefits of Personal Interest
                In general, personal interest in an academic topic or activity tends to correlate with achievement related to the topic or activity.
                As you might suppose, a student who is truly interested is more likely to focus on the topic or activity more fully, to work at it for longer periods, to use more thoughtful strategies in learning - and to enjoy doing so (Hidi, 2001; Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Small wonder that the student achieves more! 
                Note, though, a persistent ambiguity about this benefit: it is often not clear whether personal interest leads to higher achievement, or higher achievement leads to stronger interest. Either possibility seems plausible. Research to sort them out, however, has suggested that at least some of the influence goes in the direction from interest to achievement.
                When elementary students were given books from which to learn about a new topic, for example, they tended to learn more from books which they chose themselves than from books that were simply assigned (Reynolds & Symons,
                n-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). 
                Motives Related to Attributions
                Attributions are perceptions about the causes of success and failure. Suppose that you get a low mark on a test and are wondering what caused the low mark. 
                You can construct various explanations for - make various attributions about - this failure. Maybe you did not study very hard; maybe the test itself was difficult; maybe you were unlucky; maybe you just are not smart enough. 
                Each explanation attributes the failure to a different factor. The explanations that you settle upon may reflect the truth accurately - or then again, they may not. What is important about attributions is that they reflect personal beliefs about the sources or causes of success and failure. As such, they tend to affect motivation in various ways, depending on the nature of the attribution (Weiner, 200
                Locus, Stability and Controllability
                Click on the following tabs to explore the attributions that are related to success.
                Locus
                Stability
                Controllability

                Attributions vary in three underlying ways: locus, stability, and controllability. 
                The locus of an attribution is the location (figuratively speaking) of the source of success or failure. 
                If you attribute a top mark on a test to your ability, then the locus is internal. But if you attribute the mark to the test‚Äôs having easy questions, then the locus is external. 
                As you might suspect, the way that these attributions combine affects students‚Äô academic motivations in major ways. 

                    It usually helps both motivation and achievement if a student attributes academic successes and failures to factors that are internal and controllable, such as effort or a choice to use particular learning strategies (Dweck, 2000). 
                    Attributing successes to factors that are internal but stable or controllable (like ability), on the other hand, is both a blessing and a curse: sometimes it can create optimism about prospects for future success (‚ÄúI always do well‚Äù), but it can also lead to indifference about correcting mistakes (Dweck, 2006), or even create pessimism if a student happens not to perform at the accustomed level (‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm not as smart as I thought‚Äù). 
                    Worst of all for academic motivation are attributions, whether stable or not, related to external factors. Believing that performance depends simply on luck (‚ÄúThe teacher was in a bad mood when marking‚Äù) or on excessive difficulty of material removes incentive for a student to invest in learning. 

                Introduction to Self-Efficacy
                In addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students‚Äô motives are affected by specific beliefs about the student‚Äôs personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997).
                Self-efficacy is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal. Note that the belief and the action or goal are specific. 
                Self-efficacy is a belief that you can write an acceptable term paper, for example, or repair an automobile, or make friends with the new student in class. These are relatively specific beliefs and tasks.  
                Self-efficacy is not about whether you believe that you are intelligent in general, whether you always like working with mechanical things, or think that you are generally a likeable person. 
                These more general judgments are better regarded as various mixtures of self-concepts (beliefs about general personal identity) or of self-esteem (evaluations of identity). They are important in their own right, and sometimes influence motivation, but only indirectly (Bong & Skaalvik, 2
                Self-efficacy beliefs, furthermore, are not the same as ‚Äútrue‚Äù or documented skill or ability. They are self-constructed, meaning that they are personally developed perceptions. 
                There can sometimes therefore be discrepancies between a person‚Äôs self-efficacy beliefs and the person‚Äôs abilities. You can believe that you can write a good term paper, for example, without actually being able to do so, and vice versa: you can believe yourself incapable of writing a paper, but discover that you are in fact able to do so. 
                In this way self-efficacy is like the everyday idea of confidence, except that it is defined more precisely. And as with confidence, it is possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy. The optimum level seems to be either at or slightly above true capacity (Bandura, 1997). Large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational problems for the individual.
                Effects of Self-Efficacy on Students' Behavior
                Self-efficacy may sound like a uniformly desirable quality, but research as well as teachers‚Äô experience suggests that its effects are a bit more complicated than they first appear.
                Self-efficacy has three main effects, each of which has both a ‚Äúdark‚Äù or undesirable side and a positive or desirable side:

                    Choice of tasks
                    Persistence at tasks
                    Choice of Tasks
                    The first effect is that self-efficacy makes students more willing to choose tasks where they already feel confident of succeeding. This effect is almost inevitable, given the definition of the concept of self-efficacy, it has also been supported by research on self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares & Schunk, 2001). 
                    For teachers, the effect on choice can be either welcome or not, depending on circumstances. If a student believes that he or she can solve mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework that the teacher assigns. 

                    Unfortunately the converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is incapable of math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math homework (perhaps telling himself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use of trying?‚Äù), regardless of the student‚Äôs actual ability in math.
                    nce self-efficacy is self-constructed, furthermore, it is also possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and the misperceptions themselves can have complex effects on students‚Äô motivations. 
                    From a teacher‚Äôs point of view, all is well even if students overestimate their capacity but actually do succeed at a relevant task anyway, or if they underestimate their capacity, yet discover that they can succeed and raise their self-efficacy beliefs as a result. 
                    All may not be well, though, if students do not believe that they can succeed and therefore do not even try, or if students overestimate their capacity by a wide margin, but are disappointed unexpectedly by failure and lower their self-efficacy beliefs.
                    Persistence at Tasks
                    A second effect of high self-efficacy is to increase a persistence at relevant tasks. If you believe that you can solve crossword puzzles, but encounter one that takes longer than usual, then you are more likely to work longer at the puzzle until you (hopefully) really do solve it.

                    This is probably a desirable behavior in many situations, unless the persistence happens to interfere with other, more important tasks (what if you should be doing homework instead of working on crossword puzzles?).

                    If you happen to have low self-efficacy for crosswords, on the other hand, then you are more likely to give up early on a difficult puzzle.
                    Giving up early may often be undesirable because it deprives you of a chance to improve your skill by persisting. Then again, the consequent lack of success because of giving up may provide a useful
                    Response to failure
                    As with choosing tasks, the effects of self-efficacy vary from one individual to another and one situation to another. The teacher‚Äôs task is therefore two-fold: first, to discern the variations, and second, to encourage the positive self-efficacy beliefs.

                    Learned helplessness was originally studied from the behaviorist perspective of classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman (1995).
                    The studies used a somewhat ‚Äúgloomy‚Äù experimental procedure in which an animal, such as a rat or a dog, was repeatedly shocked in a cage in a way that prevented the animal from escaping the shocks. 
                    In a later phase of the procedure, conditions were changed so that the animal could avoid the shocks by merely moving from one side of the cage to the other. Yet frequently they did not bother to do so! Seligman called this behavior learned helplessness.
                    Sources of Self-Efficacy Beliefs
                    Psychologists who study self-efficacy have identified four major sources of self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares & Schunk, 2001, 2002). 
                    In order of importance they are: 
                        Prior experiences of mastering tasks
                        Watching others mastering tasks
                        Messages or "persuasion" from others
                        Emotions related to stress and discomfort
                    Fortunately the first three can be influenced by teachers directly, and even the fourth can sometimes be influenced indirectly by appropriate interpretive comments from the teacher or others
                    Prior Experiences of Mastery
                    Not surprisingly, past successes at a task increase students‚Äô beliefs that they will succeed again in the future. The implication of this basic fact means that teachers need to help students build a history of successes.
                    Whether they are math problems, reading assignments, or athletic activities, tasks have to end with success more often than with failure. Note, though, that the successes have to represent mastery that is genuine or competence that is truly authentic.
                    Success at tasks that are trivial or irrelevant do not improve self-efficacy beliefs, nor does praise for successes that a student has not really had (Erikson, 1968/1994).
                    As a practical matter, creating a genuine history of success is most convincing if teachers also work to broaden a student‚Äôs vision of ‚Äúthe past‚Äù. 
                    Younger students (elementary-age) in particular have relatively short or limited ideas of what counts as ‚Äúpast experience‚Äù; they may go back only a few
                    Watching Others' Experiences of Mastery
                    A second source of efficacy beliefs comes from vicarious experience of mastery, or observing others‚Äô successes (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1997). Simply seeing someone else succeed at a task, in other words, can contribute to believing that you, too, can succeed.
                    The effect is stronger when the observer lacks experience with the task and therefore may be unsure of his or her own ability. It is also stronger when the model is someone respected by the observer, such as a student‚Äôs teacher, or a peer with generally comparable ability. 

                The main points from this module are as follows:

                    Self-efficacy is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal.

                Three main effects of self-efficacy  are:

                    Choice of tasks - self-efficacy makes students more willing to choose tasks where they already feel confident of succeeding
                    Persistence at tasks - self-efficacy increases  persistence at relevant tasks
                    Response to failure - self-efficacy for a task improves a student‚Äôs ability to cope with stressful conditions and to recover their motivation following outright failures

                    Learned helplessness is a perception of complete lack of control in mastering a task. It can occur when a person has a low sense of self-efficacy.

                he main sources of self-efficacy are:

                    Prior experiences of mastering tasks
                    Watching others‚Äô mastering tasks
                    Messages or ‚Äúpersuasion‚Äù from others
                    Emotions related to stress and discomfort
                    These can be influenced by teachers.

                Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation
                Common sense suggests that human motivations originate from some sort of inner ‚Äúneed‚Äù. Everyone thinks of themselves as having various ‚Äúneeds‚Äù, a need for food, for example, or a need for companionship - that influence their choices and activities. 
                This same idea also forms part of some theoretical accounts of motivation, though the theories differ in the needs that they emphasize or recognize
                For example, Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs can be seen as an illustration of motivations that function like needs which influence long-term personal development. According to Maslow, individuals must satisfy physical survival needs before they seek to satisfy needs of belonging, they satisfy belonging needs before esteem needs, and so on. 
                In theory, too, people have both deficit needs and growth needs, and the deficit needs must be satisfied before growth needs can influence behavior (Maslow, 1970).
                A recent theory of motivation based on the idea of needs is self-determination theory, proposed by the psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000), among others. 
                The theory proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:

                    Autonomy -  the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior
                    Competence - the need to feel capable or skilled
                    Relatedness - the need to feel connected or involved with others

                Note that these needs are all psychological, not physical; hunger, for example, is not on the list. They are also about personal growth or development, not about deficits that a person tries to reduce or eliminate. 
                Unlike food (in behaviorism) or safety (in Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy), you can never get enough of autonomy, competence, or relatedness. You (and your students) will seek to enhance these continually throughout life.
                The key idea of self-determination theory is that when persons (such as you or one of your students) feel that these basic needs are reasonably well met, they tend to perceive their actions and choices to be intrinsically motivated or ‚Äúself-determined‚Äù. 
                In that case they can turn their attention to a variety of activities that they find attractive or important, but that do not relate directly to their basic needs. Among your students, for example, some individuals might read books that you have suggested, and others might listen attentively when you explain key concepts from the unit that you happen to be teaching. 
                If one or more basic needs are not met well, however, people will tend to feel coerced by outside pressures or external incentives. They may become preoccupied, in fact, with satisfying whatever need has not been met and thus exclude or avoid activities that might otherwise be interesting, educational, or important. If the persons are students, their learning will suffer.
                Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation
                In principle, a student can experience self-determination even if the student must, for example, live within externally imposed rules of appropriate classroom behavior. To achieve a feeling of self-determination, however, the student‚Äôs basic needs must be met - needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
                In motivating students, then, the bottom line is that teachers have an interest in helping students to meet their basic needs, and in not letting school rules or the teachers‚Äô own leadership styles interfere with or block satisfaction of students‚Äô basic needs.
                ‚ÄúPure‚Äù self-determination may be the ideal for most teachers and students, of course, but the reality is usually different. For a variety of reasons, teachers in most classrooms cannot be expected to meet all students‚Äô basic needs at all times. 

                    One reason is the sheer number of students, which makes it impossible to attend to every student perfectly at all times. 
                    Another reason is teachers‚Äô responsibility for a curriculum, which can require creating expectations for students‚Äô activities that sometimes conflict with students‚Äô autonomy or makes them feel (temporarily) less than fully competent. 
                    Still another reason is students‚Äô personal histories, ranging from divorce to poverty, which may create needs in some individuals which are beyond the power of teachers to remedy.

                The result from students‚Äô point of view is usually only a partial perception of self-determination, and therefore a simultaneous mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
                Self-determination theory recognizes this reality by suggesting that the

                Using Self-Determination Theory in the Classroom
                What are some teaching strategies for supporting students‚Äô needs? Educational researchers have studied this question from a variety of directions, and their resulting recommendations converge and overlap in a number of ways. 
                For convenience, the recommendations can be grouped according to the basic need that they address:

                    Supporting autonomy in learners
                    Supporting the need for competence
                    Supporting the need to relate to other
                    Supporting Autonomy in Learners
                    A major part of supporting autonomy is to give students choices wherever possible (Ryan & Lynch, 2003). The choices that encourage the greatest feelings of self-control, obviously, are ones that are about relatively major issues or that have relatively significant consequences for students, such as whom to choose as partners for a major group project. 
                    But choices also encourage some feeling of self-control even when they are about relatively minor issues, such as how to organize your desk or what kind of folder to use for storing your papers at school. 

                    It is important, furthermore, to offer choices to all students, including students needing explicit directions in order to work successfully; avoid reserving choices for only the best students or giving up offering choices altogether to students who fall behind or who need extra help. 
                    All students will feel more self-determined and therefore more motivated if they have choices of some sort.
                    Teachers can also support students‚Äô autonomy more directly by minimizing external rewards (like grades) and comparisons among students‚Äô performance, and by orienting and responding themselves to students‚Äô expressed goals and interests.
                    In teaching elementary students about climate change, for example, you can support autonomy by exploring which aspects of this topic have already come to students‚Äô attention and aroused their concern.
                    The point of the discussion would not be to find out ‚Äúwho knows the most‚Äù about this topic, but to build and enhance students‚Äô intrinsic motivations as much as possible. 
                    In reality, of course, it may not be possible to succeed at this goal fully - some students may simply have no interest in the topic, for example, or you may be constrained by time or resources from individualizing certain activities fully. 
                    But any degree of attention to students‚Äô individuality, as well as any degree of choice, will support students‚Äô autonomy.
                    Supporting the Need for Competence
                    The most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting activities which are challenging but nonetheless achievable with reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, & Thrash, 2004). 
                    Although few teachers would disagree with this idea, there are times when it is hard to put into practice, such as when you first meet a class at the start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar with their backgrounds and interests. 
                    But there are some strategies that are generally effective even if you are not yet in a position to know the students well. Click on the following tabs to explore some of these strategies.
                    Challenging but Achievable Activities
                    Emphasize Active Responses
                    Respond and Give Feedback as Immediately as Possible
                    Participation Structures
                    Natural Solutions
                    The most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting activities which are challenging but nonetheless achievable with reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, & Thrash, 2004). 
                    Although few teachers would disagree with this idea, there are times when it is hard to put into practice, such as when you first meet a class at the start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar with their backgrounds and interests
                    Supporting the Need to Relate to Others
                    The main way of supporting students‚Äô need to relate to others is to arrange activities in which students work together in ways that:
                        Are mutally supportive
                        Recognize students' diversity
                        Minimize competition among individuals
                    Note that having students work together can happen in many ways. You can, for example, deliberately arrange projects that require a variety of talents; some educators call such activities ‚Äúrich group work‚Äù (Cohen, 1994; Cohen, Brody, & Sapon-Shevin, 2004).
                    In studying in small groups about medieval society, for example, one student can contribute his drawing skills, another can contribute his writing skills, and still another can contribute his dramatic
                    There are other ways to encourage relationships among students. In the jigsaw classroom (Aronson & Patnoe, 1997), for example, students work together in two phases.  
                        In the first phase, groups of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù work together to find information on a specialized topic. 
                        In a second phase the expert groups split up and reform into ‚Äúgeneralist‚Äù groups containing one representative from each former expert group.
                    Example of the jigsaw classroom


                    In studying the animals of Africa each expert group might find information about a different particular category of animal or plant; one group might focus on mammal, another on bird, a third on reptiles, and so on. 
                    In the second phase of the jigsaw, the generalist groups would pool information from the experts to get a more well-rounded view of the topic. The generalist groups would eac
                    The main points from this module are as follows:
                        The theory of self-determination is based on the idea of needs. It proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:
                        Autonomy - the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior
                        Competence - the need to feel capable or skilled
                        Relatedness - the need to feel connected or involved with others
                        According to the theory, when a person feels that these needs are met, they perceive their actions to be self-determined, and can turn their attention to other activities that are important - such as studying.
                            Self-determination can be thought of as a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, as some of the basic needs may be fulfilled by an outside source, such as a teacher. 
                            A teacher can implement strategies to support students' needs, so that self-determination can become easier for their students to achieve.
                            Some of these strategies are:
                            Supporting autonomy in learners by offering them choices.
                            Supporting the need for competence by setting activities that are both challenging and achievable.
                            Supporting the need to relate to others by arranging activities in which students will work together constructively.
                            Self-determination theory provides a sensible way to think about getting students to manage their own learning, however take care not to:
                            Provide too many choices for students, as this can be frustrating
                            Differentiate activities to students' competence levels if it means not covering key curriculum objectives
                            ter completing this module you will be able to:
                                Understand that the expectancy of success combined with the value of success is the general model for motivation
                                Use the TARGET model, which is a combination of motivation theories
                                Integrate the combined different theories of motivation into your own style of teaching 
                                Expectancy x Value = Motivation
                                Motivation is affected by several factors, including reinforcement for behavior, but especially also students‚Äô goals, interests, and sense of self-efficacy and self-determination. 
                                The factors combine to create two general sources of motivation: students‚Äô expectation of success and the value that students place on a goal. 
                                Viewing motivation in this way is often called the expectancy-value model of motivation (Wigfield & Eccles, 2002; Wigfield, Tonk, & Eccles, 2004), and sometimes written with a multiplicative formula: expectancy x value = motivation.
                                The relationship between expectation and value is ‚Äúmultiplicative‚Äù rather than additive because in order to be motivated, it is necessary for a person to have at least a modest expectation of success and to assign a task at least some positive value. 
                                If you have high expectations of success but do not value a task at all (mentally assign it a ‚Äú0‚Äù value), then you will not feel motivated at all. Likewise, if you value a task highly but have no expectation of success about completing it (assign it a ‚Äú0‚Äù expectancy), then yo

                                Expectancies and Values
                                Effects on Student Motivation
                                Expectancies are the result of various factors, but particularly the goals held by a student, and the student‚Äôs self-efficacy. A student with mastery goals and strong self-efficacy for a task, for example, is likely to hold high expectations for success - almost by definition.
                                Values are also the result of various factors, but especially students‚Äô interests and feelings of self-determination. A student who has a lasting personal interest in a task or topic and is allowed to choose it freely is especially likely to value the task - and therefore to feel motivated.

                                Ideally both expectancies and values are high in students on any key learning task. The reality, however, is that students sometimes do not expect success, nor do they necessarily value it w
                                TARGET: A Model for Integrating Ideas about Motivation
                                A model of motivation that integrates many ideas about motivation, including those already looked at, has been developed by Carole Ames (1990, 1992). 
                                The acronym or abbreviated name for the program is TARGET, which stands for six elements of effective motivation:
                                    Task
                                    Autonomy

                                Task
                                Students experience tasks in terms of their value, their expectation of success, and their authenticity. 
                                The value of a task is assessed by its importance, interest to the student, usefulness or utility, and the cost in terms of effort and time to achieve it. 
                                Expectation of success is assessed by a student's perception of the difficulty of a task. Generally a middling level of difficulty is optimal for students; too easy, and the task seems trivial (not valuable or meaningful), and too hard, and the task seems unlikely to succeed and in this sense useless. 
                                Authenticity refers to how much a task relates to real-life experiences of students; the more it does so, the more it can build on students' interests and goals, and the more meaningful and motivating it becomes.
                                Motivation: Sustaining Focus on Learning
                                It is important to remember to sustain the focus of motivation on the students' learning. 
                                Click on the following tabs to explore this concept.

                                    This is called the expectancy-value model of motivation, and is written as a multiplication formula: expectancy x value = motivation. 
                                    If a student does not expect to succeed, they will feel no motivation. Likewise if they do not value the task they will have no motivation. 
                                    It is vital to remember to sustain the focus of motivation on the students' learning
                                    The TARGET model integrates many ideas of motivation. The acronym stands for:
                                        Task - the value a student places on a task is important
                                        Autonomy - motivation is enhanced if students feel a degree of autonomy for the task
                                        Recognition - being recognized for their achievements can enhance motivation
                                        Grouping - working in groups can increase motivation
                                        Evaluating - the type of evaluation will greatly influence a student's outlook on a task, and hence their motivation towards it

                    Content, Procedures, and Behavior Control
                    Classrooms are different from many other group situations in that communication serves a unique combination of three purposes at once (Wells, 2006) :

                        Content
                        Procedures
                        Behavior Control

                    ontent Talk
                    Content talk focuses on what is being learned; it happens when a teacher or student states or asks about an idea or concept for example, or when someone explains or elaborates on some bit of new knowledge (Burns & Myhill, 2004). 
                    Usually content talk relates in some obvious way to the curriculum or to current learning objectives, as when a teacher tells a high school history class, ‚ÄúAs the text explains, there were several major causes of the American Civil War.‚Äù 
                    But content talk can also digress from the current learning objectives; a first-grade student might unexpectedly bring a caterpillar to school and ask about how it transforms into a butterfly
                    Procedural Talk
                    Procedural talk, as its name implies, is about administrative rules or routines needed to accomplish tasks in a classroom. It happens, for example, when the teacher says, ‚ÄúWhen you are done with your spelling books, put them in the bins at the side of the room‚Äù, or when a student asks, ‚ÄúDo you want us to print our names at the top of page?"
                    Procedural talk provides information that students need to coordinate their activities in what can be a relatively crowded space - the classroom - and under conditions in which time may be relatively short or tightly scheduled. It generally keeps activities organized and flowing smoothly. 
                    Procedural talk is not primarily about removing or correcting unwanted behavior, although certain administrative procedures might sometimes annoy a particular student, or students might sometimes forget to follow a procedure. 
                    Instead it is intended to provide the guidance that students need to coordinate with each other and with the teacher.
                    Control Talk
                    Control talk is about preventing or correcting misbehaviors when they occur, particularly when the misbehaviors are not because of ignorance of procedures. It happens, for example, when a teacher says, ‚ÄúJill, you were talking when you should have been listening‚Äù, or ‚ÄúJason, you need to work on your math instead of doodling.‚Äù
                    Most control talk originates with the teacher, but students sometimes engage in it with each other, if not with the teacher. One student may look at a nearby classmate who is whispering out of turn and quietly say, ‚ÄúShhh!‚Äù in an attempt to silence the behavior. Or a student may respond to being teased by a classmate by saying simply, ‚ÄúStop it!‚Äù 
                    Whether originating from the teacher or a student, control talk may not always be fully effective. But its purpose is, by definition, to influence or control inappropriate behavio
                    ombining Functions
                    What can make classroom discourse confusing is that two of its functions - content and procedures - often become combined with the third, control talk, in the same remark or interaction. For example, a teacher may ask a content-related question as a form of control talk.
                    She may, for example, ask, ‚ÄúJeremy, what did you think of the film we just saw?‚Äù The question is apparently about content, but the teacher may also be trying to end Jeremy‚Äôs daydreaming and to get him back on task - an example of control talk. 

                    Or a teacher may state a rule: ‚ÄúWhen one person is talking, others need to be listening.‚Äù The rule is procedural in that it helps to coordinate classroom dialogue, but it may also control inattentive behavior.
                    Double functions like those mentioned can sometimes confuse students because of their ambiguity, and lead to misunderstandings between certain students and teachers. 
                    A student may hear only the content or procedural function of a teacher‚Äôs comment, and miss an implied request or command to change inappropriate behavior (Collins & Michaels, 2006).
                    Double functions can also help lessons to flow smoothly by minimizing the disruption of attending to a minor behavior problem and by allowing more continuous attention to content or procedures.
                    Types of Communication
                    Another way to understand classroom communication is to distinguish verbal from non-verbal communication and intended from unintended forms of communication. Click on the following tabs to explore this concept in further detail.
                    Verbal Communication
                    As the name suggests, verbal communication is a message or information expressed in words, either orally or in writing.

                    Classrooms obviously have lots of verbal communication; it happens every time a teacher explains a bit of content, asks a question, or writes information or instructions on the chalkboard.

                    The classroom language register works the same way; it helps indicate who the teacher is and who the student is. Teachers and students use the register more in some situations than in others, but its use is common enough that most people in our society have no trouble recognizing it when they hear it (Cazden, 2001).

                    Register
                    Teachers and students have identifiable styles of talking to each other that linguists call a register. A register is a pattern of vocabulary, grammar, and expressions or comments that people associate with a social role. Click on the following tabs to explore this concept in further detail.

                    Why This is Important
                    A familiar example is the "baby-talk" register often used to speak to an infant. Its features - simple repeated words and nonsense syllables, and exaggerated changes in pitch- mark the speaker as an adult and mark the listener as an infant.

                    How Teachers Talk
                    Although teacher talk varies somewhat with the tasks or purposes at hand, it also has uniformities that occur across a range of situations.
                    Using detailed observations of discourse in science activities, for example, Jay Lemke identified all of the strategies on the following page from observations of teachers' classroom talk (1990).
                    Each strategy simultaneously influences the course of discussion and focuses students' attention, and in these ways also helps indirectly to insure appropriate classroom behav

                    Nominating, Terminating, and Interrupting Speakers
                    Teachers often choose who gets to speak. (‚ÄúJose, what do you think about X?‚Äù). 

                    On the other hand, they often bring an end to a student‚Äôs turn at speaking or even interrupt the student before he or she finishes. (‚ÄúThanks; we need to move on now.‚Äù)

                    Signaling Boundaries Between Activities
                    How Students Talk
                    Children and youth also use a characteristic speech register when they are in a classroom and playing the role of students in the presence of a teacher. Their register - student talk - differs somewhat from the teacher's because of their obvious difference in responsibilities, levels of knowledge, and relationships with each other and with the teacher.

                    Calling Out
                    Answering a Question with a Question
                    Sometimes students interrupt a discussion to ask about or remind others, and especially the teacher, of an agreed-on agenda.
                    For example: if the teacher tells students to open their text to an incorrect page a student may raise her hand to correct the teacher - or even do so without raising a hand.
                    This communication strategy is one of more public, direct ways that students influence activities in the classroom, but its power is limited, since it does not create new activities, but simply returns the class to activities agreed on previously.
                    Student-talk and teacher-talk are similar in that both involve language strategies that guide content and procedures, and that sometimes seek to limit the inappropriate behavior of others.
                    Compared to teachers', though, students' language strategies often pursue these goals a bit more indirectly.

                    The student says nothing in response to a speaker's comments or to an invitation to speak. The speaker could be either the teacher or the fellow student.

                        In classrooms, communication serves a combination of 3 purposes at one time: content, procedures, and behavior control.
                        There are 3 different types of communication: verbal, non-verbal, and unintentional.
                        A register is a pattern of vocabulary, grammar, and expressions or comments that people associate with a social role. In the classroom, teachers and students have extremely different roles, so their registers are very different.
                        Teachers use communication in ways that signal their authority, some examples include: nominating, terminating, and interrupting speakers; marking importance or irrelevance; asking "test" questions and evaluating students' responses; using enunciation and grammar that formalizes the environment.
                        Students also use communication in the classroom to guide content and procedures, but are limited in how much they can do this. Some examples are: agenda enforcement, digression attempts, and

                    The following slides contain instructional strategies both for students and for teachers, and indicate how they contribute to effective verbal communication about content.
                    As a teacher, when explaining ideas it helps:

                        To offer organizing ideas in advance
                        To relate new content to prior knowledge
                        To organize and elaborate on new information

                    There are ways in which students can talk about content which may result in greater understanding of their own thinking, such as:

                    Introduction
                    In addition to communicating about content, teachers need to communicate procedures and expectations about appropriate classroom behavior. 
                    Procedural talk and control talk matter are used in teaching simply because clear procedures and appropriate classroom behavior are necessary if students are to learn.
                    Note that the difference between procedural and content talk is arbitrary to some extent; in many situations one kind of talk serves the needs of the other kind.
                    Examples of Strategies for Procedural Talk
                    Introduction to Effective Non-Verbal Communication
                    In spite of their importance, words are not the only way that teachers and students communicate.
                    Gestures and behaviors convey information as well, often supporting a teacher's words, but sometimes also contradicting them.
                    Students and teachers express themselves non-verbally in all conversations, so freely and automatically in fact, that this form of communication can easily be overlooked.
                    ye Contact
                    One important non-verbal behavior is eye contact, which is the extent and timing of when a speaker looks directly at the eyes of the listener.
                    For example, in conversations between friends of equal status most native speakers of English tend to look directly at the speaker when listening, but to avert their gaze when speaking (Kleinke, 1986). 

                    In fact, re-engaging in eye contact often signals that a speaker is about to finish a turn and is inviting a response from the listener.
                    Conversations follow different rules if they involve someone of greater authority talking with someone of lesser authority, such as between a teacher and a student.

                    In that case, the person in authority signals greater status by gazing directly at the
                    For students unused to continuous eye contact, it can feel like the teacher is staring excessively, intrusively, or inappropriately; an ironic effect can be for the student to feel more self-conscious rather than more engaged, which was intended.
                    For similar reasons, inexperienced or first-time teachers can also feel uncomfortable with gazing at students continuously. 
                    Nevertheless research about the effects of eye contact suggests that it may help anyone, whether a student or a teacher, to remember what they are seeing and hearing (Mason, Hood, & Macrae, 2004).
                    Communication problems result less from eye contact as such than from differences in expectations of eye contact. If students' expectations differ very much from the teacher's, one party may misinterpret the other party's motivations. 
                    Among some non-white ethnic groups, for example, eye contact follows a pattern that reverses the conventional white, English-language pattern: they tend to look more intently at a partner when talking, and avert gaze when listening (Razack, 1998).
                    In that case one person may interpret the direct gaze as an invitation to start talking, when really it is an invitation to stop talking.
                    Eventually the conversational partner may find himself interrupting too much, or simply talking too long at a turn.
                    The converse can also happen: if the first person looks away, the partner may take the gesture as inviting the partner to keep listening, when really the first person is inviting the partner to start talking. Awkward gaps between comments may result.

                    In either case, if the conversational partners are a teacher and student, rapport may deteriorate gradually.
                    In the first case, the teacher may even conclude, wrongly, that the student is socially inept because the student interrupts so much.
                    In the second case, the teacher may conclude - also wrongly - that the student is very shy or even lacking in language skill.
                    Wait Time
                    Another important non-verbal behavior is wait time, which is the pause between conversational turns. Wait time marks when a conversational turn begins or ends.
                    For example, if a teacher asks a question the wait time both allows and prompts students to formulate an appropriate response.
                    Studies on classroom interaction generally show that the wait time in most classes are remarkably short - less than one second (Good & Brophy, 2002).

                    Unfortunately wait times this short can actually interfere with most students' thinking; in one second, most students either cannot decide what to say or can only recall a simple, automatic fact (Tobin, 1987).
                    Increasing wait times to several seconds has several desirable effects: students give longer, more elaborate responses, they express more complex ideas, and a wider range of students participate in discussion.
                    with eye contact, preferred wait times vary both among individuals and among groups of students, and the differences in expected wait times can sometimes lead to awkward conversations.
                    Though there are many exceptions, girls tend to prefer longer wait times than boys - perhaps contributing to an impression that girls are unnecessarily shy or that boys are self-centered or impulsive.
                    Students from some ethnic and cultural groups tend to prefer a a much longer wait time than is typically available in a classroom, especially when English is the student's second language (Toth, 2004).
                    Therefore, when a teacher converses with a member of such a group, what feels to the student like a respectful pause may seem like hesitation or resistance to the teacher.
                    Yet other cultural groups actually prefer overlapping comments - a sort of negative wait time.
                    In these situations, one conversational partner will begin at exactly the same instant as the previous speaker, or even before the sp
                    e negative wait time is meant to signal lively interest in the conversation. A teacher who is used to a one-second gap between comments, however, may regard overlapping comments as rude interruptions, and may also have trouble getting chances to speak.

                    Even though longer wait times are often preferable, they do not always work well with certain individuals or groups.  For teachers, the most widely used advice is to match wait time to the students' preferences as closely as possible, regardless of whether these are slower or faster than what the teacher normally prefers.
                    To the extent that a teacher and students can match each other's pace, they will communicate more comfortably and fully, and a larger proportion of students will participate in discussions and activities. 
                    Social Distance
                    When two people interact, the physical space or distance between them - their social distance - often indicates something about how intimate or personal their relationship is (Noller, 2006).
                    Social distance also affects how people describe others and their actions; someone who habitually is more distant physically is apt to be described in more general, abstract terms than someone who often approaches more closely (Fujita, et al., 2006).
                    In white American society, a distance of approximately half a meter to a meter is what most people prefer when talking face-to-face with a personal friend.
                    The closer end of this range is more common if the individuals turn sideways to each other, as when riding on an elevator; but usually the closest distances are reserved for truly intimate friendships, such as between spouses.
                    As with eye contact, observing students' preferred wait times is easier in situations that give students some degree of freedom about when and how to participate, such as open-ended discussions or informal conversations throughout the day.
                    The main points from this module are as follows:

                        Three of the main types of verbal communication used in the classroom are: content talk, procedural talk, and control talk.
                        Three of the main types of non-verbal communication used in the classroom are: eye contact, wait time, and social distance.
                        Some ways in which students communicate about content are: inquiry learning and cooperative learning.
                        Some ways in which teachers communicate about content are: relating new material to prior knowledge and elaborating and extending information.
                        Some issues may arise with non-verbal communication, because different people have different: patterns of eye contact, wait times that they are comfortable with, and preferences for social distance.
                        Due to these issues, teachers shoul
                        After completing this module you will be able to:
                            Identify and describe the four main participation structures that guide communication in ways expected by the class
                            Describe advantages and disadvantages of the participation structures: lecturing; questions and answers; discussions; and group work.
                            Understand and describe the effect that the different structures have on preparation for class for the teacher
                        d pay close attention to the preferences for eye contact, social distance and wait times of their students.
                        Effects on Communication
                        Many class activities take on patterns that guide communication in ways that class members learn to expect, often without being reminded.
                        Each pattern is a participation structure, a set of rights and responsibilities expected from students and teachers. 
                        Sometimes the teacher announces or explains the rights and responsibilities explicitly, though often they are just implied by the actions of class members, and individual students learn them simply by watching others.
                        For example, a lecture has a particular participation structure: students are responsible for listening, for raising a hand to speak, and for keeping comments brief and relevant if called on.

                        The teacher, on the other hand, has the right to talk at length, but also the responsibility to keep the talk relevant and comprehensible.

                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        The General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) is the new EU Regulation on Data Protection, which will come into force on the 25th May 2018.
                        GDPR - Get aware, and get prepared!

                        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) significantly changes data protection law in Europe, strengthening the rights of individuals and increasing the obligations on organisations. 
                        The GDPR will give greater control to individuals over their personal data by setting out additional and more clearly defined rights for individuals whose personal data is collected and processed by organisations and businesses.
                        Key Date: 25th May 2018 

                        All organisations that process data need to be aware that the GDPR will apply directly to them. The responsibility to become familiar with the Regulation and comply with its provisions from 25th May 2018 onwards therefore lies with the organisation.


                        This course covers:

                            The purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                            What organisations can do to prepare for the GDPR.
                            What the role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in the GDPR entails.
                            Guidance around personal data security for microenterprises.
                            Five steps organisations can implement to secure their cloud-based environments.
                            How the GDPR affects the private individual and their data protection rights.
                            The key steps organisations need to take to ensure
                            The GDPR and Data Protection
                            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace current data protection laws in the European Union.
                            The new law will give individuals greater control over their data by setting out additional and more clearly defined rights for individuals whose personal data is collected and processed by organisations. The GDPR also imposes corresponding and greatly increased obligations on organisations that collect this data.
                            Personal data is any information that can identify an individual person. This includes:
                            - a name, 
                            - an ID number, 
                            - location data (for example, location data collected by a mobile phone) or a postal address, 
                            - online browsing history, 
                            - images or anything relating to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a person.
                            compliance with the GDPR.
                            Core Principles
                            The GDPR is based on the core principles of data protection which exist under the current law. These principles require organisations and businesses to:
                                Collect no more data than is necessary from an individual for the purpose for which it will be used; 
                                Obtain personal data fairly from the individual by giving them notice of the collection and its specific purpose;
                                Retain the data for no longer than is necessary for that specified purpose;
                                Keep data safe and secure; 
                                Provide an individual with a copy of his or her personal data if they request it.

                        Strengthened Rights and Greater Transparency
                        Under the GDPR individuals have the significantly strengthened rights to:

                            Obtain details about how their data is processed by an organisation or business;
                            Obtain copies of personal data that an organisation holds on them; 
                            Have incorrect or incomplete data corrected; 
                            Have their data erased by an organisation, where, for example, the organisation has no legitimate reason for retaining the data; 
                            Obtain their data from an organisation and to have that data transmitted to another organisation (Data Portability); 
                            Object to the processing of their data by an organisation in certain circumstances; 
                            Not be subject to (with some exceptions) automated decision making, including profiling (see topic 'Introduction to GDPR for the Private Individual').

                        Organisations and businesses collecting and processing personal data will be required to meet a very high standard in how they collect, use and protect data. Very importantly, organisations must always be fully transparent to individuals about how they are using and safeguarding personal data, including by providing this information in easily accessible, concise, easy to understand and clear language.
                        Financial Penalties
                        For organisations and businesses who breach the law, the Data Protection Commissioner is being given more robust powers to impose very substantial sanctions including the power to impose fines.
                        Under the new law, the DPC will be able to fine organisations up to ‚Ç¨20 million (or 4% of total global turnover) for the most serious infringements.
                        The GDPR will also permit individuals to seek compensation through the courts for breaches of their data privacy rights, including in circumstances where no material damage or financial loss has been suffered.
                        Organisations Must Prepare for GDPR
                        It is essential that all organisations immediately start preparing for the implementation of GDPR by carrying out a ‚Äúreview and enhance‚Äù analysis of all current or envisaged processing in line with GDPR. This will allow time to ensure that you have adequate procedures in place to deal with the improved transparency, accountability and individuals‚Äô rights provisions, as well as optimising your approach to governance and how to manage data protection as a corporate issue. 
                        It is essential to start planning your approach to GDPR compliance as early as you can, and to ensure a cohesive approach amongst key people in your organisation.
                        The sooner you begin to prepare for the GDPR, the more cost-effective it will be for your organisation.  The GDPR also makes it considerably easier for individuals to bring private claims against data controllers when their data privacy has been infringed, and allows data subjects who have suffered non-material damage as a result of an infringement to sue for compensation.
                        The Data Protection Officer (DPO) Role in the GDPR

                        The Data Protection Officer (DPO) role is an important GDPR innovation and a cornerstone of the GDPR‚Äôs accountability-based compliance framework. In addition to supporting an organisation‚Äôs compliance with the GDPR, DPOs will have an essential role in acting as intermediaries between relevant stakeholders (e.g. supervisory authorities, data subjects, and business units within an organisation).
                        The DPO will have professional standing, independence, expert knowledge of data protection and, to quote the GDPR, be ‚Äòinvolved properly and in a timely manner‚Äô in all issues relating to the protection of personal data.
                        The DPC recommends that all organisations who will be required by the GDPR to appoint a DPO should do this as soon as possible and well in advance of May 2018. With the authority to carry out their critical function, the Data Protection Officer will be of pivotal importance to an organisation‚Äôs preparations for the GDPR and meeting the accountability obligations.
                        A DPO may be a member of staff at the appropriate level with the appropriate training, an external DPO, or one shared by a group of organisations, which are all options provided for in the GDPR.
                        It is important to note that DPOs are not personally responsible where an organisation does not comply with the GDPR. The GDPR makes it clear that it is the controller or the processor who is required to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that the processing is in accordance with the GDPR. Data protection compliance is ultimately the responsibility of the controller or the processor.
                        Who needs a DPO?

                            All public authorities and bodies, including government departments.
                            Where the core activities of the organisation (controller or processor) consist of data processing operations, which require regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale.
                            Where the core activities of the organisation consist of special categories of data (ie health data) or personal data relating to criminal convictions or offences.
                            Public Authority or Body?
                            Public authorities and bodies include national, regional and local authorities, but the concept typically also includes a range of other bodies governed by public law.
                            It is recommended, as a good practice, that private organisations carrying out public tasks or exercising public authority should designate a DPO.
                            Core activities can be defined as the key operations necessary to achieve an organisation‚Äôs (controller or processor‚Äôs) goals. For example, a private security company which carries out surveillance of private shopping centres and/or public spaces using CCTV would be required to appoint a DPO as surveillance is a core activity of the company. 
                            On the other hand, it would not be mandatory to appoint a DPO where an organisation undertakes activities such as payroll and IT support as, while these involve the processing of personal data, they are considered ancillary rather than core activities.
                            Large-scale processing
                            While the GDPR does not define large-scale the following factors should be taken into consideration:
                                The number of individuals (data subjects) concerned ‚Äì either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population.
                                The volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed.
                                The duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity.
                                The geographical extent of the processing activity.
                            Large-scale Processing
                            Small-scale Processing
                            Examples of large-scale processing include:
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital.
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of travel data of individuals using a city‚Äôs public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards).
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in providing these services.
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank.
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine.
                            ‚Ä¢ Processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers. 
                            Regular and systematic monitoring
                            Regular and systematic monitoring should be interpreted, in particular, as including all forms of tracking and profiling on the internet, including for behavioural advertising. However, the definition of monitoring is not restricted to the online environment. Online tracking is just one example of monitoring the behaviour of individuals.
                            Regular Monitoring
                            Systematic Monitoring
                            ‚ÄòRegular Monitoring‚Äô is interpreted by the Working Party 29 (comprising the EU‚Äôs data protection authorities) as meaning one or more of the following:
                            ‚Ä¢ Ongoing or occurring at particular intervals for a particular period.
                            ‚Ä¢ Recurring or repeated at fixed times. 
                            Special Categories of Data
                            These include personal data revealing; racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person‚Äôs sex life or sexual orientation or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences
                            Further information and guidance
                            Further information and guidance on the Data Protection Officer role is set out in the guidelines of the Working Party 29. In particular, these guidelines set out the position of the EU‚Äôs data protection authorities on matters such as:
                            ‚Ä¢ Designation of a single DPO for several organisations
                            ‚Ä¢ Expertise and skills of the DPO
                            ‚Ä¢ Role, tasks, responsibilities and independence of the DPO
                            ‚Ä¢ Resources that should be provided to a DPO to carry out their tasks
                            Qualifications
                            Article 37.5 of the GDPR provides that a Data Protection Officer ‚Äúshall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39.‚Äù
                            The GDPR does not define the professional qualities required or prescribe the training a DPO should undergo to be qualified to undertake the role. This allows organisations to decide on their DPO‚Äôs qualifications and training tailored to the context of the organisation‚Äôs data processing.
                            The appropriate level of qualification and expert knowledge should be determined according to the personal data processing operations carried out, the complexity and scale of data processing, the sensitivity of the data processed and the protection required for the data being processed.
                            Relevant Skills and Expertise
                            Relevant skills and expertise include: 
                                expertise in national and European data protection laws and practices including an in-depth understanding of the GDPR;
                                understanding of the processing operations carried out; 
                                understanding of information technologies and data security; 
                                knowledge of the business sector and the organisation; 
                                ability to promote a data protection culture within the organisation. 
                            For example, a DPO may need an expert level of knowledge in certain specific IT functions, international data transfers, or familiarity with sector-specific data protection practices such as public sector data processing and data sharing, to adequately perform their duties.
                            raining Courses
                            Taking into account the scale, complexity and sensitivity of their data processing operations, organisations should proactively decide on the qualifications and level of training required for their Data Protection Officer.
                            In undertaking such an assessment, organisations should be aware that there are various training options that may be pursued. Some training courses are one-day sessions, while some are online only. Others lead to academically accredited certificates such as diplomas from national law societies. 
                            There are also other professional training programmes which are recognised internationally and that offer professional qualifications that require an ongoing commitment to training in order to maintain the professional qualification.
                            For example, where a data processing activity is particularly complex, or where a large volume or sensitive data is involved (i.e. an internet or insurance company), the DPO may need a higher level of expertise and support.
                            Conflict of Interests
                            It is important to take into account that while a DPO is permitted to fulfil other tasks and duties, the organisation is required to ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. This is essential to protecting the independence of the DPO. 
                            In particular, it means that a DPO cannot hold a position in an organisation where they have the authority to decide the purposes for which personal data is processed and the means by which it is processed.
                            While each organisational structure should be considered case by case, as a rule of thumb, conflicting positions within an organisation may include senior management positions such as chief executive, chief operating/financial/medical officer, head of HR or head of IT). 
                            Publication and communication of the DPO‚Äôs contact details
                            Organisations will be required by the GDPR to publish contact details of the DPO and to communicate these details to the relevant data protection authority. 
                            The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that individuals (internal and external to the organisation) and the data protection authority can easily and directly contact the DPO without having to contact another part of the organisation.
                            Personal Data Security Guidance for Microenterprises
                            The GDPR significantly increases the obligations and responsibilities of organisations and businesses with regard to how they collect, use and protect personal data.
                            At the heart of the new law is the requirement for organisations and businesses to be transparent about how they are obtaining, using and safeguarding personal data. This transparency requirement is outlined under Article 12 of the GDPR and encompasses the provision of clear, concise information to data subjects and the facilitation of data subjects‚Äô rights.
                            Additionally the principle of accountability, which is outlined under Article 5 of the GDPR, will see organisations and businesses responsible for demonstrating their compliance with the new law‚Äôs principles relating to the processing of personal data.
                            What is a Microenterprise?
                            A microenterprise is defined as an organisation having fewer than 10 employees and an annual turnover (the amount of money taken in a particular period) or balance sheet (a statement of a company's assets and liabilities) below ‚Ç¨2 million [1].
                            If your company is a microenterprise engaged in the processing of personal data, as either a data controller or a data processor, you will be subject to the provisions of the new law. A data controller is defined under article 4 of the GDPR as a natural or legal person that determines, alone or jointly with others, the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The same article defines a data processor as a natural or legal person that processes personal data on a data controller‚Äôs behalf.
                            The GDPR is applicable to the processing of personal data by microenterprises established in and operating outside the European Union (EU). If your company is established in the EU, the provisions of the GDPR are applicable to your processing of personal data in the context of the activities of your EU establishment(s).
                            If your company is not established in the EU, the new law is applicable to your processing of the personal data of individuals in the EU with regard to the offering of goods or services (regardless of whether payment is involved) and to the monitoring of an individual‚Äôs behavior (in so far as that behaviour takes place within the
                            Four Key Ways to Secure ICT Systems
                            Four key ways to assist microenterprises in securing their Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems under the GDPR:
                                Know your data
                                Determine the Appropriate Level of ICT Security
                                Data Collection and Retention Policies
                                1. Know your data
                                Microenterprises should regularly review the personal data they process and determine what personal data and, in particular, what special categories of personal data they hold.
                                ‚ÄòPersonal data‚Äô is defined under Article 4 of the GDPR as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a ‚Äúdata subject‚Äù). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                                Article 9 of the GDPR defines ‚Äòspecial categories of personal data‚Äô, as data relating to an individual‚Äôs:
                                    racial or ethnic origin
                                    political opinions
                                    religious or philosophical beliefs
                                    trade union membership
                                    genetic data
                                    biometric data
                                    data concerning health
                                    Principles you must adhere to with regard to the processing of personal data are outlined in Article 5 of the GDPR. When considering your company‚Äôs processing, questions to be asked include whether you are processing personal data:
                                        According to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency;
                                        For specified, explicit and legitimate purposes;
                                        With a view to data minimisation;
                                        With a view to ensuring accuracy and, where necessary, that data is kept up to date;
                                        Such that data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of processing; 
                                        In a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data.
                                    If you outsource the processing of personal data to a data processor (including, for example, to a 'cloud computing' service provider), you should be able to confirm that:
                                        The processing is compliant with Article 28 of the GDPR;
                                        The processor‚Äôs security procedures are adequate;
                                        You have sought and been given assurances regarding the appropriate security measures from the processor.

                                Utilising Data Processors
                            2. Determine the Appropriate Level of ICT Security
                            Article 32 of the GDPR obliges data controllers and data processors to implement the technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risks presented by processing. In considering what constitutes an appropriate level of security, you should take into account
                                "The state of the art"
                                "The cost of implementing and the nature of the scope"
                                "The context and purposes of processing‚Äù
                                ‚ÄúThe risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons"
                            The DPC has published best practice Data Security Guidance [2] regarding the security of ICT systems. Additional information is also available from organisations such as the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security [3], and the US-based National Institute of Standards and Technology [4].
                            Security measures predominately fall under the following headings:
                            (These will be outlined in more detail on the following pages)
                                Technical security
                                Physical security
                                Organisational security
                            Technical security
                            Technical security measures protect ICT systems by ensuring that appropriate technology is implemented to secure personal data processing.
                            Examples of practical technical security measures are:
                                Ensuring that all computing devices such as PCs, mobile phones, and tablets are using an up-to-date operating system;
                                Ensuring all computing devices are regularly updated with manufacturer‚Äôs software and security patches;
                                Using antivirus software on all devices;
                                Implementing a strong firewall;
                                Reviewing vendor supplied software and updating default system, administrator, and root passwords and other security parameters to ensure defaults are not left in place;
                                Ensuring data backups are taken and are stored securely in a separate location;
                                Ensuring that data backups are periodically reviewed and tested to ensure they are functioning correctly;
                                Ensuring that data is collected & stored securely;
                                Ensuring that mobile devices (such as laptops and mobile phones and tablets) are encrypted;
                                Ensuring that two-factor authentication is enabled for remote access;
                                Ensuring that websites have TLS (transport layer security) in place to securely collect personal data via webforms (such as for newsletter subscriptions) or on e-commerce websites.
                            Physical security
                            Physical ICT security measures assist organisations with the protection of ICT systems such as facilities, equipment, personnel, resources, and other properties. 
                            Examples of ICT equipment that may require protection includes any device which can store information electronically, such as:
                                Computers - servers, desktop, laptop or tablet
                                Photocopiers, multi-function devices and printers
                                Mobile telephones
                                Digital cameras
                                Storage media, such as, portable hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, DVDs
                            The level of protection that should be applied to ICT equipment is based on the business impact level that may result from data being compromised, loss of integrity, or unavailability of the electronic information held on the device, this would also include the loss or unavailability of the device due to a failure.
                            Examples of practical physical security measures are:
                                Keeping offices and storage units locked;
                                Keeping server rooms or cabinets locked;
                                Cabling desktop machines and laptops to desks;
                                Implementing clean desk policies;
                                Ensuring that fire and burglar alarms are in place and that they are functioning correctly;
                                Ensuring that ICT equipment such as hard drives and old laptops, computers and mobile devices are securely disposed of at end of life.
                            Organisations should also assess the risk arising when devices cannot be secured when not in use. Where an organisation has determined the business impact of the data compromise, loss of integrity or unavailability regarding a device, which is not in use, organisations should ensure that such devices are stored securely.
                            It is recommended that microenterprises design and implement an asset control policy for ICT equipment. This would include:
                                Recording the location and user of the device;
                                Conducting periodical audits of its ICT equipment.
                            Organisational security
                            Organisational security measures protect ICT systems by ensuring that policies, procedures, training, and audit trail functions are in place.
                            These measures are mostly documentary in nature, however such policies need not be time consuming nor overly complicated to implement. Any documentation should be written in clear, concise, language, should list the rules that apply to the processing of personal data, and should be readily accessible to employees. Such documentation should be reviewed periodically to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.
                            Examples of practical organisational security measures consist of:
                                Communicating the importance of company data and all the measures they can take to protect it to employees;
                                Conducting ongoing staff training on, but not limited to, social engineering attacks, crypto ransomware, and data protection;
                                Documenting data collection and retention policies;
                                Ensuring the use of strong passwords by having a password policy in place that is enforced;
                                Ensuring remote access is supported by a remote access policy;
                                Documenting a data breach incident response plan and testing it periodically to ensure a data breach can be effectively responded to;
                                Documenting CCTV policies (where appropriate);
                                Documenting data back-up policies;
                                Periodically reviewing contracts with 3rd party ICT providers to ensure the security measures documented are still appropriate and up to date.
                            3. Data Collection and Retention Policies
                            If your organisation will be holding personal data for longer periods, you should be aware of your obligations under Article 5(1)(e) as both a data controller and a data processor with regard to data retention. The essence of the storage limitation principle under the GDPR is slightly different to the existing principle under the Data Protection Directive. 

                            In summary, personal data should not be retained in identifiable form for longer than is necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed. A pragmatic approach to retention is simply to delete the data once the purpose for which it was processed has ceased. Data collection and retention should be assessed against business needs and minimised, either by not collecting unnecessary data, by deleting data, or by rendering it anonymous.

                            Microenterprises should:
                                Define and implement a data collection policy. The policy should detail the categories of personal data collected and the purposes for collection.
                                Define and implement a data retention policy. This policy should detail the retention period for personal data collected and measures taken to ensure deletion or if applicable, the techniques to render the data non-identifiable.
                            These policies should be communicated to all employees and periodic reviews should be conducted to ensure that personal data is handled correctly when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.
                            ith regard to retention policies, if you intend to further process personal data for the purposes of archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, you should ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure the rights and this processing does not impede freedoms of data subjects.
                            In particular, these safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation.
                            A documented retention policy should offer guidance and provide a framework for employees to manage information across its lifecycle so that your company complies with the laws and regulations pertaining to data management. A retention policy should apply to both physical and digital formats.
                            4. Utilising Data Processors
                            Microenterprises, due to a lack of in-house expertise, may rely on third party data processors to process personal data on their behalf, such as e-commerce websites, cloud services such as email or online data backup solutions. Microenterprises should:
                                Define the responsibilities of the data controller and data processor and ensure that processing is carried out on foot of a written agreement detailing the appropriate technical security and organisational measures to be applied by the data processor specifically in relation to the personal data processing operations.
                                Obtain sufficient guarantees regarding the security measures applied by processors acting on their behalf and periodically review to ensure that the terms of the written agreement are being adhered to.
                            A practical way for a microenterprise to obtain sufficient guarantees and ensure compliance is to:
                                Use a data processor that has vendor certification, appropriate IT qualifications and/or certification, or the appropriate certification from a relevant certifying body such as the International Organization for Standardization or the Payment Card Industry.
                                Have formal project completion / change management sign off procedures in place to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented and that changes/updates are performed.
                                Have data processors provide regular reports on the management of the ICT systems and following up to ensure that work is carried out.
                                Review security measures periodically to ensure they are up to date, this can be especially prevalent when utilising Cloud-Based environments (see the next Topic in the course).
                            Five Steps to Secure Cloud-based Environments
                            Cloud-based environments offer many advantages to organisations. However, they also introduce a number of technical security risks which organisations should be aware of such as:
                                Data breaches
                                Hijacking of accounts
                                Unauthorised access to personal data
                            Organisations should determine and implement a documented policy and apply the appropriate technical security and organisational measures to secure their Cloud-based environments. If organisations do not implement such controls, they may increase their risk of a personal data breach [1].
                            Organisations should apply technical security and organisational security measures in a layered manner consisting of but not limited to:
                                Access controls
                                Firewalls
                                Antivirus software
                                Staff training
                                A layered approach to Cloud-based security mitigates the risk of a single security measure failing which may result in a personal data breach.
                                Many Cloud-based providers, such as Microsoft‚Äôs Office 365 and Google‚Äôs G-suite provide advanced settings and solutions which can assist organisations to appropriately secure their use of Cloud-based services. These providers, in most cases, also offer best practice guidance to assist organisations in securing their Cloud-based environments.
                                Additional information, advice, and best practice regarding security of Cloud-based environments is also provided by agencies such as the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (E

                                Policy development
                            Five key ways organisations can secure their Cloud-based environments to mitigate their risk of a personal data breach:
                                Access control and authentication
                                Review default security settings
                                Seek assurances from your ICT service provider
                                Clear policies and staff training
                                Know your data and secure it
                            1. Access control and authentication
                                Organisations should implement strong password polices [3] to ensure that users accessing personal data within Cloud-based environments do so in a secure manner.
                                Organisations should implement two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is an effective way to further enhance Cloud-based security and is available from most Cloud-based providers.
                                Organisations should be aware of and document user access privileges within their Cloud-based environments. User access control is particularly important where group mailboxes or shared folders are utilised. Organisations should also document each user‚Äôs specific access requirements and ensure that these are supported by an appropriate change control process.
                                Security measures applied by an organisation must be supported by regular reviews of user access to ensure that all authorised access to personal data is strictly necessary and justifiable for the performance of a specific function.
                                2. Review default security settings
                                Organisations should not rely on Cloud-based service providers‚Äô default security settings. Organisations should review the Cloud-based security features available from the Cloud-based service provider to ensure that they are applied appropriately and in a layered manner. Examples of security settings and controls provided by Cloud-based service providers often include: 
                                    Centralised administration tools
                                    Mobile device management
                                    Multifactor authentication
                                    Login alerts
                                    Encryption during message send and receive
                                    Encryption of message content
                                    Account activity monitoring and alerts
                                    Data loss prevention
                                    Malware protection
                                    3. Seek assurances from your ICT service provider
                                        Organisations may utilise external ICT services providers to implement their Cloud-based environments.  It is vital during such engagements that organisations seek formal assurances from their ICT service provider that the security controls which have been implemented meet an organisation‚Äôs specific security requirements and protect the organisation‚Äôs personal data.
                                        Organisations should proactively engage and conduct regular security reviews  with their ICT service providers to ensure the security controls in place are up-to-date and are effective to protect the organisation in an evolving threat landscape.
                                    4. Clear policies and staff training
                                        Organisations should ensure that staff receive appropriate training on social engineering attacks, phishing attacks and security threat practices. Such training should be supported by refresher training/awareness programmes to mitigate the risk posed by an evolving threat landscape.
                                        Organisations should have clear policies in place with respect to the usage and security of Cloud-Based services, especially where these services are being accessed outside of the organisation corporate network under Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") policies.
                                        Organisations should have clear ‚Äúemployee leaver‚Äù and ‚Äúsuccession‚Äù policies in place and these should be applied to an organisations Cloud-based environment.
                                        Organisations should have a clear policy in place for data retention and conduct regular reviews to ensure that personal data is not retained longer than necessary or where the original purpose for the use of the personal data has ceased.

                                    Spam and spoofing protection
                                    Phishing protection
                            5. Know your data and secure it
                                Organisations should understand and monitor the types of data that is stored in their Cloud-based environments. Knowing the types of data stored in the Cloud enables an organisation to ensure the appropriate security and access controls are applied to protect the data. 
                                Organisations should utilise data classification methods to identify the data which they store and process within Cloud-based environments. The process of data classification enables an organisation to categorise their stored data in order to determine the appropriate security controls.
                                Organisations should carefully evaluate Cloud-based vendors based on the security features they offer and how they specifically meet with their organisational requirements. 
                                Who has access to your data, how is it secured, how often is the data backed up and if the Cloud-based environment aligns to your organisational policies are all vital questions to ask of both your Cloud-Based service provider and / or the ICT service provider charged with implementing your environment.
                                Applying the appropriate security measures is not a once off ‚ÄúSet and forget‚Äù exercise. Cloud-based security settings should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they are still appropriate and up-to-date.
                                Introduction to the GDPR for the Private Individual
                                Data protection is a fundamental right set out in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights:
                                    Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
                                    Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
                                    Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
                                The key principles under the GDPR are:
                                    Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
                                    Purpose Limitation
                                    Data minimisation
                                    Accuracy
                                    Storage Limitation
                                    Integrity and confidentiality
                                    Accountability
                                The information in this course is intended to guide you through your rights, as data subjects, under the GDPR.
                                What rights do you have?

                                    The right to be informed (Article 13 & 14 of the GDPR)

                                These eight rights for the private individual are covered in the following page
                                1. The right to be informed (Article 13 & 14)

                                Where the personal data is collected from you, the data controller must provide you with the following information:
                                Personal Data 1
                                Identity and contact details of the data controller (and where applicable, the controller‚Äôs representative).
                                Personal Data 2
                                Personal Data 3

                                Personal Data 6
                                Personal Data 7
                                Personal Data 8






                                Personal Data 9
                                Personal Data 10
                                Personal Data 11
                                When should this information be provided to you?
                                - At the time your personal data is collected from you.
                                How will this information be provided to you?
                                - Clear guidance on this process can be found in the section 'Matters which apply to all the rights detailed above' later in this topic.
                                What happens when the data controller intends to process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected?
                                Where the controller intends to process your personal data for another purpose (other than the purpose for which the data was originally collected):
                                - The controller must provide you, prior to that other processing, with any further relevant information as per Personal Data 1 - 12 above.
                                Are there any circumstances in which these requirements will not apply?
                                The above requirements will not apply:
                                - Where you already have the above information.
                                Personal Data 12
                                Where the personal data has not been obtained from you, the data controller must provide you with:
                                    The information in Personal Data 1 - 10 & 12 above;
                                    Information on the types of personal data they hold about you;
                                    Information on how they obtained the personal data and whether it came from publicly accessible sources.
                                When should this information be provided to you?
                                - Within a reasonable period of having obtained the data and, at the latest, within one month;
                                - If the data is used to communicate with you, at the latest, when the first communication takes place;
                                - If it is expected that your personal data will be disclosed to another recipient, when your personal data is first disclosed.
                                How will this information be provided to you?
                                - Clear guidance on this process can be found in the section 'Matters which apply to all the rights detailed above' later in this topic.
                                What happens when the data controller intends to process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected?
                                Where the controller intends to process your personal data for another purpose (other than the
                                purpose for which the data was originally collected):
                                - The controller must provide you, prior to that other processing, with any further relevant information.
                                Are there any circumstances in which these requirements will not apply?
                                The above requirements will not apply:
                                - Where you already have the above information;
                                - Where the provision of such information is impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort;
                                - Where obtaining the information or disclosure is a legal obligation and
                                - Where the personal data must remain confidential due to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by law.
                                This right will typically be fulfilled through a ‚ÄòPrivacy Notice‚Äô.

                                You have the right to obtain the following, from the data controller:
                                    Confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed;
                                    Where personal data concerning you is being processed, a copy of your personal information;
                                    Where personal data concerning you is being processed, you have the right to other additional information as follows:
                                Additional Information 1
                                Purpose(s) of the processing.
                                4. The right to erasure (Articles 17 & 19)

                                This is also known as the ‚Äòright to be forgotten‚Äô.


                                You have the right to have your data erased, without undue delay, by the data controller, if one of the following grounds applies:
                                    Where your personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or processed;
                                    Where you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other lawful basis for processing the data;
                                    Where you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate grounds for continuing the processing (See point 6 below).
                                    Where you object to the processing and your personal data is being processed for direct marketing purposes (See point 6 below);
                                    Where your personal data has been unlawfully processed;
                                    Where your personal data have to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation;
                                    Where your personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services to a chil
                                    What happens when the data controller made your personal data public and is obliged to erase the data?
                                    Where the data controller has made your personal data public and, on the basis of one of the above grounds, is obliged to erase the data:
                                    - The data controller must communicate any rectification or erasure of your personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
                                    - If you request information on recipients of your personal data, the data controller must inform you about the recipients.
                                    - The data controller shall take reasonable steps to inform other controllers, who are processing your personal data, that you have requested the erasure by them of any links to or copies of your data.
                                    Reasonable steps means taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation including technical measures.
                                    5. The right to data portability (Article 20)

                                    In some circumstances, you may be entitled to obtain your personal data from a data controller in a format that makes it easier to reuse your information in another context, and to transmit this data to another data controller of your choosing without hindrance. This is referred to as the right to data portability.
                                     When does the right to data portability arise?
                                    This right only applies where processing of personal data (supplied by the data subject) is carried out by automated means, and where you have either consented to processing, or where processing is conducted on the basis of a contract between you and the data controller.
                                    This right only applies to the extent that it does not affect the rights and freedoms of others.
                                    When this right applies, how must data controllers provide and transmit data?
                                    What Can Organisations Do Now to Prepare for the GDPR?
                                    The following are areas that all organisations should cover to prepare effectively for the GDPR. These areas will be covered in more detail in the following pages.
                                        Becoming Aware
                                        Becoming Accountable
                                        Communicating with Staff and Service Users
                                        Personal Privacy Rights
                                        How will Access Requests change?
                                        What we mean when we talk about a ‚ÄòLegal Basis‚Äô
                                        Using Customer Consent as grounds to process data
                                        Processing Children's Data
                                        Reporting Data Breaches
                                        1. Becoming Aware
                                        It is imperative that key personnel in your organisation are aware that the law is changing to the GDPR, and start to factor this into their future planning. They should start to identify areas that could cause compliance problems under the GDPR. 
                                        Initially, data controllers should review and enhance their organisations risk management processes, as implementing the GDPR could have significant implications for resources; especially for more complex organisations. Any delay in preparations may leave your organisation susceptible to compliance issues following the GDPR‚Äôs introduction.
                                        2. Becoming Accountable
                                        Make an inventory of all personal data you hold and examine it under the following headings:
                                            Why are you holding it?
                                            How did you obtain it?
                                            Why was it originally gathered?
                                            How long will you retain it?
                                            How secure is it, both in terms of encryption and accessibility?
                                            Do you ever share it with third parties and on what basis might you do so?
                                        This is the first step towards compliance with the GDPR‚Äôs accountability principle, which requires organisations to demonstrate (and, in most cases, document) the ways in which they comply with data protection principles when transacting business. The inventory will also enable organisations to amend incorrect data or track third party disclosures in the future, which is something that they may be required to do.
                                        3. Communicating with Staff and Service Users
                                        Review all current data privacy notices alerting individuals to the collection of their data. Identify any gaps that exist between the level of data collection and processing your organisation engages in, and how aware you have made your customers, staff and services users of this fact. If gaps exist, set about redressing them using the criteria laid out in ‚Äò2: Becoming Accountable‚Äô above as your guide.
                                        Before gathering any personal data, current legislation requires that you notify your customers of your identity, your reasons for gathering the data, the use(s) it will be put to, who it will be disclosed to, and if it‚Äôs going to be transferred outside the EU. 
                                        Under the GDPR, additional information must be communicated to individuals in advance of processing, such as the legal basis for processing the data, retention periods, the right of complaint where customers are unhappy with your implementation of any of these criteria, whether their data will be subject to automated decision making and their individual rights under the GDPR. The GDPR also requires that the information be provided in concise, easy to understand and clear language.
                                        4. Personal Privacy Rights
                                        You should review your procedures to ensure they cover all the rights individuals have, including how you would delete personal data or provide data electronically and in a commonly used format.
                                        Rights for individuals under the GDPR include:
                                            Subject access
                                            To have inaccuracies corrected
                                            To have information erased
                                            To object to direct marketing
                                            To restrict the processing of their information, including automated decision-making
                                            Data portability
                                        On the whole, the rights individuals will enjoy under the GDPR are the same as those under the Acts, but with some significant enhancements. Organisations who already apply these principles will find the transition to the GDPR less difficult. 
                                        Review your current procedures.
                                            How would your organisation react if it received a request from a data subject wishing to exercise their rights under the GDPR?
                                            How long to locate (and correct or delete) the data from all locations where it is stored?
                                            Who will make the decisions about deletion?
                                            Can your systems respond to the data portability provision of the GDPR, if applicable where you have to provide the data electronically and in a commonly used fo
                                            How will Access Requests change?
                                            You should review and update your procedures and plan how you will handle requests within the new timescales. (There should be no undue delay in processing an Access Request and, at the latest, they must be concluded within one month). The rules for dealing with subject access requests will change under the GDPR. In most cases, you will not be able to charge for processing an access request, unless you can demonstrate that the cost will be excessive. 
                                            The timescale for processing an access request will also shorten, dropping significantly from the current 40 day period. Organisations will have some grounds for refusing to grant an access request. Where a request is deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive, it can be refused. However, organisations will need to have clear refusal policies and procedures in place, and demonstrate why the request meets these criteria. You will also need to provide some additional information to people making requests, such as your data retention periods and the right to have inaccurate data corrected. 
                                            If your organisation handles a large number of access requests, the impact of the changes could be considerable. The logistical implications of having to deal with requests in a shorter time frame and provide additional information will need to be factored into future planning for organisations. It could ultimately save your organisation a great deal of administrative cost if you can develop systems that allow people to access their information easily online.

                                            6. What is meant by the term ‚ÄòLegal Basis‚Äô
                                            You should look at the various types of data processing you carry out, identify your legal basis for carrying it out and document it. This is particularly important where consent is relied upon as the sole legal basis for processing data. 
                                            Under the GDPR, individuals will have a stronger right to have their data deleted where customer consent is the only justification for processing. You will have to explain your legal basis for processing personal data in your privacy notice and when you answer a subject access request.
                                            For government departments and agencies, there has been a significant reduction in the number of legal bases they may rely on when processing data. It will no longer be possible to cite legitimate interests. Instead, there will be a general necessity to have specific legislative provisions underpinning one or more of the methods organisations use to process data. 
                                            All organisations need to carefully consider how much personal data they gather, and why. If any categories can be discontinued, do so. For the data that remains, consider whether it needs to be kept in its raw format, and how quickly you can begin the process of anonymisation and pseudonymisation. 
                                            Using Customer Consent to process data
                                            If you do use customer consent when you record personal data, you should review how you seek, obtain and record that consent, and whether you need to make any changes. Consent must be ‚Äòfreely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.‚Äô Essentially, your customer cannot be forced into consent, or be unaware that they are consenting to processing of their personal data. 
                                            They must know exactly what they are consenting to, and there can be no doubt that they are consenting. Obtaining consent requires a positive indication of agreement ‚Äì it cannot be inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity.
                                            If consent is the legal basis relied upon to process personal data, you must make sure it will meet the standards required by the GDPR. If it does not, then you should amend your consent mechanisms or find an alternative legal basis.
                                            Note that consent has to be verifiable, that individuals must be informed in advance of their right to withdraw consent and that individuals generally have stronger rights where you rely on consent to process their data. 
                                            The GDPR is clear that controllers must be able to demonstrate that consent was given. You should therefore review the systems you have for recording consent to ensure you have an effective audit trail.
                                            . Processing Children‚Äôs Data
                                            If the work of your organisation involves the processing of data from underage subjects, you must ensure that you have adequate systems in place to verify individual ages and gather consent from guardians.
                                            The GDPR introduces special protections for children‚Äôs data, particularly in the context of social media and commercial internet services. The state will define the age up to which an organisation must obtain consent from a guardian before processing a child‚Äôs data. It should be noted that consent needs to be verifiable, and therefore communicated to your underage customers in language they can understand.
                                            9. Reporting Data Breaches
                                            You should make sure you have the right procedures in place to detect, report and investigate a personal data breach. Some organisations are already required to notify the DPC when they incur a personal data breach. However, the GDPR will bring in mandatory breach notifications, which will be new to many organisations. 
                                            All breaches must be reported to the DPC, typically within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted. In practice this will mean that most data breaches must be reported to the DPC. Breaches that are likely to bring harm to an individual ‚Äì such as identity theft or breach of confidentiality ‚Äì must also be reported to the individuals concerned. 
                                            Now is the time to assess the types of data you hold and document which ones which fall within the notification requirement in the event of a breach. Larger organisations will need to develop policies and procedures for managing data breaches, both at central or local level. It is worth noting that a failure to report a breach when required to do so could result in a fine, as well as a fine for the breach itself.
                                            0. DPIA - Data Protection by Design and Default
                                            A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is the process of systematically considering the potential impact that a project or initiative might have on the privacy of individuals. It will allow organisations to identify potential privacy issues before they arise, and come up with a way to mitigate them. 
                                            A DPIA can involve discussions with relevant parties/stakeholders. Ultimately such an assessment may prove invaluable in determining the viability of future projects and initiatives. The GDPR introduces mandatory DPIAs for those oganisations involved in high-risk processing; for example where a new technology is being deployed, where a profiling operation is likely to significantly affect individuals, or where there is large scale monitoring of a publicly accessible area. 
                                            Where the DPIA indicates that the risks identified in relation to the processing of personal data cannot be fully mitigated, data controllers will be required to consult the DPC before engaging in the process.
                                            Organisations should now start to assess whether future projects will require a DPIA and, if the project calls for a DPIA, consider:
                                                Who will do it?
                                                Who else needs to be involved?
                                                Will the process be run centrally or locally?
                                            It has always been good practice to adopt privacy by design as a default approach; privacy by design and the minimisation of data have always been implicit requirements of the data protection principles. 
                                            However, the GDPR enshrines both the principle of ‚Äòprivacy by design‚Äô and the principle of ‚Äòprivacy by default‚Äô in law. This means that service settings must be automatically privacy friendly, and requires that the development of services and products takes account of privacy considerations from the outset.
                                            ata Protection Officers
                                            The GDPR will require some organisations to designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Organisations requiring DPOs include public authorities, organisations whose activities involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or organisations who process what is currently known as sensitive personal data on a large scale.
                                            12. International Organisations and the GDPR
                                            The GDPR includes a ‚Äòone-stop-shop‚Äô provision which will assist those organisations which operate in many EU member states. Multinational organisations will be entitled to deal with one Data Protection Authority, referred to as a Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) as their single regulating body in the country where they are mainly established. 
                                            That Data Protection Authority will then become the LSA when regulating all data protection matters involving that organisation, although it will be obliged to consult with other concerned Data Protection Authorities which are concerned in relation to certain matters.
                                            In general the main establishment of an organisation is determined according to where the organisation has its main administration, or where decisions about data processing are made. However, it would be helpful for you to map out where your organisation makes its most significant decisions about data processing, as this will help to determine your main establishment and therefore your LSA.
                                            The important thing is to make sure that someone in your organisation, or an external data protection advisor, takes responsibility for your data protection compliance and has the knowledge, support and authority to do so effectively. Therefore you should consider now whether you will be required to designate a DPO and, if so, to assess whether your current approach to data protection compliance will meet the GDPR‚Äôs requirements.
                                            The role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) under GDPR is covered in more detail in the next topic
                                            Key Steps to Ensure Compliance with the GDPR
                                            The following are 10 key steps that will ensure your business or organisation will be compliant with the new regulations in the GDPR.
                                            Step 1
                                            Identify what personal data you hold (this can be achieved by setting out the information listed in Article 30 of the GDPR or for smaller companies a tailored process such as the accompanying template that identifies details of personal data held).
                                            Step 2
                                            Step 3
                                            Step 4
                                            Step 5
                                            Step 6
                                            A Risk-based Approach to Being GDPR Compliant
                                            When your organisation collects, stores or uses (i.e. processes) personal data, the individuals whose data you are processing may be exposed to risks. It is important that organisations which process personal data take steps to ensure that the data is handled legally, securely, efficiently and effectively in order to deliver the best possible care.
                                            The risk-profile of the personal data your organisation processes should be determined according to the personal data processing operations carried out, the complexity and scale of data processing, the sensitivity of the data processed and the protection required for the data being processed. 
                                            For example, where a data processing activity is particularly complex, or where a large volume or sensitive data is involved (i.e. an internet, health, financial or insurance company), this would attract a higher risk rating than routine personal data that relates solely to employee or customer account details.
                                            hen looking at the risk profile of the personal data your organisation processes, it is useful to look at the tangible harms to individuals that your organisation needs to safeguard against. These are detailed in Recital 75 of the GDPR and include processing that could give rise to: 
                                                discrimination
                                                identity theft or fraud
                                                financial loss
                                                damage to the reputation
                                                loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy
                                                unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation
                                                any other significant economic or social disadvantage
                                            Conducting a risk-assessment will improve awareness in your organisation of the potential future data protection issues associated with a project. This will in turn help to improve the design of your project and enhance your communication about data privacy risks with relevant stakeholders.
                                            The GDPR provides for two crucial concepts for future project planning: 
                                            Data Protection By Design and Data Protection By Default. 
                                            While recommended as good practice, both of these principles are enshrined in law under the GDPR (Article 25).
                                            Data Protection by design means embedding data privacy features and data privacy enhancing technologies directly into the design of projects at an early stage. This will help to ensure better and more cost-effective protection for individual data privacy.
                                            Data Protection by default means that the user service settings (e.g. no automatic opt-ins on customer account pages) must be automatically data protection friendly, and that only data which is necessary for each specific purpose of the processing should be gathered at all.
                                            GDPR Readiness Checklist Tools
                                            These checklists are available for you to download from the Resources section of this course. You can edit them according to your own organisation‚Äôs information.
                                            The grid in the resource document will assist organisations in mapping the personal data that they currently hold and process, the lawful basis on which the data was collected, and the retention period for each category of data. Carrying out this exercise will help identify where immediate remedial actions are required in order to be compliant with the GDPR.
                                            The following pages in the resource document will take organisations through more detailed questions in the areas of:
                                                Personal data
                                                Data subject rights
                                                Accuracy and retention
                                                Transparency requirements
                                                Other data controller obligations
                                                Data security
                                                Lesson Summary

                                                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from 25th May 2018 will replace current data protection laws in the European Union.
                                                The new law will give individuals greater control over their data by setting out additional and more clearly defined rights for individuals whose personal data is collected and processed by organisations. The GDPR also imposes corresponding and greatly increased obligations on organisations that collect this data.
                                                The GDPR is based on the core principles of data protection which exist under the current law. These principles require organisations and businesses to:
                                                    Collect no more data than is necessary from an individual for the purpose for which it will be used;
                                                    Obtain personal data fairly from the individual by giving them notice of the collection and its specific purpose; 
                                                    Retain the data for no longer than is necessary for that specified purpose;
                                                    Keep data safe and secure; 
                                                    Provide an individual with a copy of his or her personal data if they request it.
                                                    The following are areas that all organisations should cover to prepare effectively for the GDPR.

                                                        Personal Privacy Rights
                                                        How will Access Requests change?
                                                        What we mean when we talk about a ‚ÄòLegal Basis‚Äô

                                                The political and legal systems are vital parts of a country‚Äôs business environment, and in navigating different markets, firms must understand how and where national business environments converge and diverge.
                                                International politics has always been characterized by the predominance of strong ideological links, centered around, and dominated by a relatively small number of large powers. Domestic politics cannot be isolated from international politics.
                                                Given the complexity of the global marketplace, solid marketing research is critical for a host of global marketing decisions.
                                                Most of the cultural blunders in global marketing stem from inadequate marketing research.
                                                Marketing research is the systematic design, colleaion, analysis, and reporting of data and findings relevant to a specific marketing situation facing the company.
                                                In most developed countries, a fairly accurate estimate of the market size for any particular product is easily obtainable.
                                                Global marketing research projects have to cater to the needs of various interest groups: global and regional headquarters, local subsidiaries.

                                                Manage different situations in class through applying the different functions and types of communication
                                            Introduction to Communication in the Classroom
                                            As a teacher, you face almost continual talk at school, supplemented by ample amounts of non-verbal communication - gestures, facial expressions, and other ‚Äúbody language‚Äù. 
                                            Often the talk involves many people at once, or even an entire class, and individuals have to take turns speaking while also listening to others having their turns, or sometimes ignoring the others if a conversation does not concern them.
                                            As the teacher, therefore, you find yourself playing an assortment of roles when communicating in classrooms: Master of Ceremonies, referee - and of course a source of new knowledge.
                                            Your challenge is to sort the roles out so that you are playing the right ones in the right combinations at the right times. 
                                            Often, you will indeed be more sincere and brief, and you will find that minimizing power differences between you and students is a good idea.
                                            Classroom events are often so complex that just talking with students can become confusing. It helps to think of the challenge as a problem in communication - or as one expert put it, of "who says what to whom, and with what effect" (Lasswell, 1964).
                                            In classrooms, things often do not happen at an even pace or in a logical order, or with just the teacher and one student interacting while others listen or wait patiently. 
                                            While such moments do occur, events may sometimes instead be more like a kaleidoscope of overlapping interactions, disruptions, and decisions - even when activities are generally going well. An example of this may be seen on the next slide.
                                            One student finishes a task while another is still only halfway done. A third student looks like she is reading, but she may really be dreaming. 
                                            You begin to bring her back on task by speaking to her, only to be interrupted by a fourth student with a question about an assignment. While you answer the fourth student, a fifth walks in with a message from the office requiring a response; so the bored (third) student is overlooked for a while longer. 
                                            Meanwhile, the first student - the one who finished the current task - now begins telling a joke to a sixth student, just to pass the time. You wonder, ‚ÄúShould I speak now to the bored, quiet reader or to the joke-telling student? Or should I move on with the lesson?‚Äù 

                                            While you are wondering this, a seventh student raises his hand with a question, and so
                                            ay to manage situations like these is to understand and become comfortable with the key features of communication that are characteristic of classrooms. 
                                                One set of features has to do with the functions or purposes of communication, especially the balance among talk related to content, to procedures, and to controlling behavior.
                                                Another feature has to do with the nature of non-verbal communication - how it supplements and sometimes even contradicts what is said verbally
                                                A third feature has to do with the unwritten expectations held by students and teachers about how to participate in particular kinds of class activities - what will later be known as the structure of participation.

                                ‚ÄòRigging and Lifting‚Äô is mainly used for heavy-duty construction work. Before knowing about the rigging, you should know about lifting first. 

                                Lifting refers to moving a heavy object from its present location to where it will be processed. Rigging comes after the lifting.
                                In this topic, you will get introduced to the basics of rigging and lifting and identify the roles of different professionals associated with rigging and lifting.

                                Rigging
                                Rigging is the act of placing, fastening, or laying down heavy objects while employing mechanical shifting tools. It also includes installing and disassembling hoists and cranes. 
                                Riggers use cranes, hoists, and other equipment like chain blocks and winch systems to move cargo. 
                                Riggers employ technology such as chain blocks, winch systems, and cranes and hoists to move loads.When transporting a load, rigging may be a complicated process that involves many different considerations.
                                Before lifting a weight, they must be fully aware of the most secure handling and placement techniques.Common rigging tools include shackles, turnbuckles, lifting eye bolts, yoke and clevis ends, nuts, etc.
                                Lifting
                                A lifting operation involves raising and lowering cargo. The thing(s) being lifted, which may or may not be a person(s), are referred to as a load. 
                                A lifting operation can be carried out manually or with the use of lifting gear. The phrase "manual handling of loads" is frequently used to describe manual lifting, holding, putting down, carrying, or transporting. Lifting is only used for locating a heavy object from one place to another.
                                It mostly includes vertical movements only.Common lifting tools include forklifts, jacks, cranes, and building cradles, as well as minor tools like hooks, ropes, and chains.
                                Always remember that lifting equipment is the subset of rigging equipment.
                                Purpose of Rigging and Lifting:
                                Transporting necessary supplies and equipment to places where employees may conveniently get them is the main purpose of rigging and lifting. By using this method, the chance of having to manually carry supplies and equipment up scaffolding, which may be challenging and dangerous, is reduc

                                Hazards Associated With Rigging and Lifting
                                There are some typical hazards in rigging and lifting such as load failure, falling and crushing, equipment damage, etc. 
                                Hazards Associated With Rigging and Lifting
                                Load Failure

                                The first scenario that frequently comes to mind when thinking about lifting and rigging is one in which cargo is dropped as a result of a sling, wire rope, or chain breaking. 
                                These kinds of accidents frequently have the worst outcomes.

                                The Collapse of a Crane
                                Limited Visibility, Speedy Air and Low Communication:
                                Need for Safety
                                Protection in a worksite is a huge responsibility for the related authority. If any calamity happens, the construction-related lawsuits tend to blame the authority saying that the lives and properties were not protected enough or safety measures were not taken properly.
                                A supervisor needs to have a priority checklist for the sake of the safety of the workers and other valuable utilities. He/she should make sure that all of the things on his checklist are tick marked.
                                The UK government has precise rules and regulations to organise a safe worksite. All the construction sites need to have
                                    Site Rules
                                    Site Induction

                                Supervisors and operators should always stay alert and take proper precautions.
                                Site Rules
                                Everyone on the premises should be aware of the regulations, be made plain and simple to grasp and be expected to abide by them. Any unique requirements, such as the necessity to make translations of the rules available for non-English speaking employees on site, should be taken into account.
                                Site rules should include the following
                                    Protective equipment for every employee
                                    Using mobile phones, and radios for uninterrupted communication
                                    Making it a No Smoking zone
                                    Wearing safety gear during hot works such as cutting, welding, soldering, etc.
                                    Well-described traffic management system
                                    Routes for pedestrian
                                    Site cleanliness
                                    Fire Prevention
                                    Permit to work procedure
                                    Arrangements in Sudden or Emergency situations
                                Clients may demand certain health and safety procedures, particularly if their business is conducted on their own
                                Site Induction
                                A proper site induction must be presented to each worker on the job site. The orientation should be site-specific and emphasise any unique dangers and preventative measures that project workers must be aware of.
                                    Upper management‚Äôs commitment to the health and safety of the workers and the worksite
                                    Describing the general framework of the project
                                    Describing the managing procedure of the project
                                    Arrangements for reporting incidents and accidents
                                    Plans for informing employees regularly, such as toolbox talks , first aid information
                                    Plans for advising the employees on health and safety issues
                                    Each employee‚Äôs responsibilities for health and safety
                                Site introductions should also be given to individuals who occasionally visit the site, such as architects or do so just once, such as students.
                                Imposing Traffic System on Worksite
                                Every year, at least 7 die, and 93 workers get seriously injured during a construction job. Most of the scenarios include accidents involving mobile plants or vehicles. 
                                The legislation requires that a construction site be organised in such a way that people and vehicles (such as cars, vans, low-loaders, lorries, lift trucks, site dumpers and mobile plants such as excavators) can navigate the site securely.
                                The routes must be adequate in size and number as well as be acceptable for the people or vehicles utilising them.

                                No matter what, accidents involving vehicles on construction sites should be avoided by managing transportation activities well throughout the rigging and lifting operations.

                            Imposing Traffic System on Worksite
                            The main requirements to deal with the traffic system in rigging and lifting site are:
                            Separating Pedestrian Path and Vehicles Route
                            - Making separate enter and exit way
                            - Creating pedestrian paths that are sturdy, level, and well-drained
                            - Providing clear signs where paths and roadways cross each other - Making sure that before moving into a footway, people heading out onto public roadways can see both ways along it
                             - Not blocking the pedestrian path or the roadways so that people start using the roadways or the vehicles have to take the path - Installing barricades to avoid unwanted incidents
                            Clear Range of View




                            Recruiting Well-Trained Employees
                            Equipment Storage
                            The ability to store items safely and effectively depends on the cooperation and coordination of all parties, including the customer, the contractor, the supplier, and the tradespeople.
                            In every project, clients and contractors should discuss the plans for equipment storage and come to an agreement. Larger notifiable projects should incorporate equipment storage options in the Construction phase plan.
                            Equipment Storage
                            Few efficient techniques for equipment storage:
                            Determine the Storage Area
                            People Walkways
                            Flammable Goods
                            Cleanliness and Wastage
                            Determine spaces for the storage of plant materials, garbage, flammable items like foam plastics, flammable liquids and gasses like propane, and hazardous materials like pesticides and chemicals used in wood treatment.
                            Welfare Facilities
                            Clients are responsible for ensuring that contractors offer welfare facilities. Decisions and actions must be taken at an early point in the project planning process.
                            Clients in the business sector must ensure contractors have plans to provide the proper wellness facilities. This is true for all forms of worksites, and the contractors must provide adequate care for personnel under their supervision while on the job.
                            Principal contractors are responsible for making sure this is done throughout the whole project. When providing welfare amenities is challenging, clients should work with contractors and assist them

                            Section 2 Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 says welfare facilities on any worksites should include two must-have arrangements:

                                Washroom and Toilet.
                                Changing room, dining and rest areas.

                            Welfare Facilities
                            The size and nature of the task will determine the kind and quantity of facilities required. To reduce the hazards from dangerous elements like cement, lead, or microorganisms, you might require shower rooms for workers. Also, keep in mind that males and females must require different amenities.
                            For employees, welfare is a fundamental and basic need. Additionally, it is mandated by legislation. Setting the correct welfare standards establishes the project's tone and shows a commitment to satisfying workers' needs. Welfare facilities are also an essential control measure in and of themselves. 
                            They aid in defending employees from the dangers posed by microorganisms, cement, lead, and other dangerous chemicals.
                            Protective Measures for Public
                            According to the legislation, projects must be carried out without endangering the general public. This includes the general public and other workers who may be impacted by your operations.The owners or clients should provide information about:

                                Area Coverage.
                                Adjacent Area Usage.
                                Accesses.
                                Arrangements to keep out unauthorised people.

                            There is no space for carelessness, even though the number of children killed or hurt on construction sites has decreased. After entering construction sites, two to three child every year pass away, and many more suffer injuries.

                            These happen because of equipment falling outside the perimeter, slipping into the ditch, or being hit by vehicles or moving plants.That‚Äôs why all the rigging and lifting site requires:
                            Access Management of the Worksite
                            Boundaries draw the line between operational area and normal area. Proper access management must be implemented to keep everyone safe and sound.

                            It includes two steps:

                                Well Planned Site Boundaries.
                                Preventing unauthorised Public.
                                Well Planned Site Boundaries
                                Appropriate Fencing
                                You must use an appropriate fence to physically establish boundaries when necessary. Fencing should match the surroundings and the worksite's characteristics. Ôªø

                                Facts to consider before installing a boundary:
                                ‚óè Nature and type of the worksite
                                ‚óè Take an idea of the amount of the population of the area
                                ‚óè Guests who will visit the area during the operation
                                ‚óè The site should not attract children and the general public
                                Preventing Unauthorised Visitors 

                            Protective Measures for Property
                            Nearby public and private property must be safeguarded during the rigging and lifting project. Problems like water flowing, damage to others‚Äô properties and erosion must be managed. There are some effective processes to avoid things like property damage.Let‚Äôs see,
                            Storing and Placing of the Equipment
                            Throughout the rigging and lifting project, construction equipment and supplies must be stored and positioned in a way that doesn't risk the general public, the employees, or nearby property.
                            ‚óè Things should not be left or stored in a way that prevents access to manholes, utility poles, catch basins, fire hydrants, standpipes, fire or police alarm boxes, or catch basins. These fixtures must be covered while work is being done, but they cannot be hidden from view.
                            ‚óè The distance between objects and a street intersection must not be closer than 20 feet which is around six meters. Things must not be arranged in such a way as to interfere with the regular observing of traffic signals or the usage of loading zones for public transportation.
                            Protective Measures for Property
                            24/7 Water Supply
                            For fire prevention, a temporary or ongoing water supply must be created, as well as extra fire safety precautions. It is necessary to designate a responsible individual to oversee risk assessment, escape routes, and warning systems, and firefighting equipment, as well as other crucial site fire safety concerns.

                            In the Rigging and Lifting business, tools are not just tools. These tools have a set of legislations and guidance. In section 6 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. 
                            Act 1974, amended March 1988, and in Section 8 of the LEEA Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Lifting Equipment, guidance and legislation for every rigging-lifting tool and equipment are described in detail. 
                            Supervisors, contractors and workers should acknowledge all the know-how and legislation of all types of equipment.
                            Beam Clamps
                            Beam clamps are used for suspension points for lifting the load. It holds the load to both sides and helps to lift it.
                            How to Identify Perfect Beam Clamps
                            Beam clamps come in a variety of capacities and styles. They may feature a scissor action, a screw locking mechanism, or a bolt clamp fastening.

                            Plan the lift and choose the appropriate beam clamp while keeping the following in mind:

                                Type of clamp: scissor, screw, or bolt action; adjustable or non-adjustable
                                Size of the beams or a variety of beam diameters and capacity

                            Lifting Beam: A lifting beam is a below-the-hook lifting tool used to add pick points to weights when one pick point is insufficient for load stability. To distribute the lift forces across the beam, they often include two or more widely spaced pick points on the bottom and a single attachment point at the top.

                            Spreader Beam: The beam is referred to be a spreader beam if the load mostly places compressive stress on it. It is a long bar that divides two slings so that the load's weight is equally distributed among two or more attachment points.
                            How to Identify Perfect Beam: 
                            Typically, lifting beams, frames, and spreaders are created with a specific function in mind. Therefore, the only constraint on the spectrum of designs and capabilities is practicality. Choosing the beam to be utilised and organising the lift with the following in mind:

                                Application requirements include the need to manage out-of-balance loads, restrict headroom, give various lift points, provide adjustable lifting centres, eliminate or regulate inward or crushing forces, and provide speciali

                                Refer to the supplier's recommendations for usage at temperatures below 0¬∞C or above 80¬∞C
                                The angle generated between the legs when using the slings in a multi-leg system should not be less than 30¬∞ or higher than 90¬∞

                            Runway Lift
                            A runway beam is an easy technique to hoist anything inside a building or structure. This makes it possible for a trolley to transport a load easily from one end to the other along the beam's length.
                            How to Identify Perfect Runway Lift

                                Custom runways can be constructed using unique track sections or regular steel sections. They might be fastened to the building's structural components, installed on free-standing buildings, or both.
                                As an alternative, a building component might be chosen and used as a runway. The additional loads that are thus placed on the building's structure or foundations are usually always added to those for which the building was originally intended.
                                Therefore, a theoretical check should be conducted by a knowledgeable individual, and adequateness should be confirmed in writing.
                                Before usage, the runway must also be tested, approved by a Competent Person, and tagged with its identity an

                            Wire Rope Slings
                            In lifting and hoisting operations, wire rope slings are a crucial component of rigging hardware that are frequently employed in a variety of industries.
                            These slings, which can be found in a wide variety of designs to accommodate a wide range of a
                            Methods for Calculating Load‚Äôs Weight
                            Professionals must find out the precise load weight before running a rigging and lifting project. The weight of the load will dictate the lift's equipment requirements. 
                            The crane or hoist, the crane hook, and the slings and shackles that secure the hook to the load are all crucial pieces of equipment utilised in the lift. You can quickly determine a load's weight in a number of methods.


                            Professionals have to figure it out on their own if no load weight information has been given. They should apply the following formula to calculate the load's units and the materials that makeup it:
                            Weight of the load = Weight per unit x Total unit
                            Let‚Äôs try with numbers,
                            If the material has a volume of 200 cubic feet and weighs 200 pounds per cubic foot, the weight would be as follows:
                            200 * 200 = 40,000 lbs.
                            So, the total weight is 40,000 lbs.
                            Basic Calculation of Angles and Pressure
                            Before lifting any objects, a worker should always measure the Safe Working Load (SWL). To calculate the SWL, we need to know the sling's load capacity, its angles, and the object's weight. 
                            It is a good idea to mark the load weight on any machinery or manufactured parts that are delivered to a job site. Check for weight indicators that are permanently marked or labelled.
                            A load's weight will be known if it is lifted frequently.  
                            Methods for Calculating SWL (Safe Working Load)
                            There are two methods of calculating the SWL (Safe Working Load).
                            First Method
                            In this method, we will learn how to calculate each sling strap's vertical safe working load.
                            First, we need three things to do that.
                            Weight of the object = W
                            Length of each strap (From hook to the connection point) = L
                            The high between the hook and the load = H
                            Calculating Using the First Method
                            We will need this formula to calculate the SWL:
                            First Step
                            Second Step
                            Example
                            The first step: Divide the length of each strap by the height and take the answer as X.
                            L √∑ H = X
                            Calculating Using the Second Method
                            This method is more straightforward compared to the first one. Find the load's midpoint or central point of gravity. It impacts the vertical share of the burden. Both sides should be equal. 

                            The connections between the hook and load using the sling create two angles. The angles are equal, so measure anyone from them.
                            Suppose it is 60¬∞. The load angle factor associated with 60¬∞ is 1.2 or 20%. So, the weight will be increased by 20% on each side. Remember, as the angular distance decreases, the pressure on the slings increases.
                            Load angle factors:

                                If the angular distance is 60¬∞, then it should be multiplied by 1.2 or 20%
                                If it's 45¬∞, then it should be multiplied by 1.414 or 50%
                                And when it's 30¬∞, then it should be multiplied by 2 or 100%

                            That the percentage amounts shown above are only for making the calculations easy. If you go by these percentages, you might find a couple of pounds more or less. However, you will get an overa
                            Example
                            Let's try it with real numbers,
                            Suppose the load is 15000 lbs and the angular distance is 60¬∞. So, the pressure on each sling will be:
                            (15000 x 1/2) x 1.2 = 9,000 lbs
                            After getting done with the calculations, check the label. If the result of
                            Things to Remember

                                Find out the perfect load weight before running a rigging-lifting project.
                                Look for the label or the catalogue that comes with the products. This information will determine how much weight the tools can lift.
                                Another reliable source of weight data is the bill of lading or shipping papers.
                                Run the calculations mentioned above if there is no information about the load‚Äôs weight.
                                Clear the surface where the weight of the load and angle-pressure are going to be calculated.
                                Don‚Äôt put extra weight on the lifted weight. It might lead the project to a total disaster.
                                Never take a pause after lifting the load, don‚Äôt let the load be hung in the air.
                                Before lifting similar loads, make sure no changes, modifications or alterations are made in the loads.
                                Information presented by the manufacturers should not be taken lightly, and this information is the first priority throughout the project and its planning.

                            the analysis surpasses the written weight limit of the label, then consider it not a safe lift. On the other hand, if it remains in its capacity, then it's good to go.

                                        Hitches in Rigging and Lifting
                                        Hitches are crucial techniques in rigging and lifting. Different methods require different hitches. There are four types of hitching techniques that are vertical hitch, double line hitch, basket hitch and choker hitch. A rigger or lifter should choose the compatible hitch technique to lift and rig the heavy object.

                                        Vertical Hitch : The most fundamental hitch for directly attaching a weight to lifting equipment is a vertical hitch, often known as a straight hitch. 
                                        One eye of a single chain sling, wire rope sling, or synthetic sling is connected to the crane or hoist hook on a vertical hitch, and the second eye is attached to the point of attachment on the load.

                                        The entire lifting capacity of the sling will be used in a lift made with a vertical hitch. 

                                        When executing an overhead lift with a single sling, a tagline should be employed to give additional load control and minimise rotation or twisting.
                                        Types of Basket Hitches
                                        Double Basket Hitch:  By keeping the slings apart, the Double Basket Hitch uses two slings to balance a load.

                                        Double Wrap Basket Hitch: This type of basket hitch is comparable to a conventional one, except the sling is wrapped twice around the weight. 
                                        This offers a good grip on smooth surfaces and great load management for loose objects.
                                        Avoid crossing the length of the sling at the bottom of the load when using a double wrap on a basket hitch, and pay attention to where the sling is placed as slack is taken up.

                            Choker Hitch
                            Choker Hitch: A choker hitch is an effective way to secure a sling and increase load management to cinch it down. One eye of the choker hitch is looped around the weight, passed through it, and then fastened to the crane or hoist hook when employing it. 

                            A choker hitch's lifting capacity is reduced to 75‚Äì80% of what it can be in a single-leg vertical hitch because of tensions induced at the choke point. When the angle of the choke is 120¬∞ or more, the capacity reduction is minimal. A lifting capability as low as 40% of the single leg may occur from a choke angle of fewer than 120 degrees.
                            Choker Hitch Capacity:
                            Types of Choker Hitch
                            Double Choker Hitch
                            Double Wrap Choker Hitch
                            A double choker hitch consists of two slings in a choker hitch to increase the surface area where the weight can be secured.
                            Rigging and Lifting Devices: Connection
                            A rigger should be aware of their safe working load (SWL) restrictions in relation to the rope or chain being used, as well as the appropriate fittings and end attachments to employ for a given lifting, hoisting, or rigging operation.
                            To ensure the maximum level of safety, only forged alloy steel and load-rated kinds should be used for overhead lifting and hoisting, even if there are many other connections, fittings, and end attachments available. Such attachments have their SWL imprinted right there.
                            Connection:   A wire rope's end tends to fray easily and is difficult to connect to machinery and other objects. Wire ropes' ends can be secured using a variety of methods to increase their utility.
                            Spliced Eyes Method: The most frequent and practical kind of wire rope end fitting is when the end is turned back to form a loop. The loose end is then secured by splicing it back onto the wire rope using a variety of techniques.
                            However, wire rope splicing is a skill that needs instruction and the right equipment to be performed safely and successfully; as a result, only skilled splicers should do eye splicing. 
                            For information on the right splicing types, techniques, and processes to employ, always refer to the handbooks and manuals of the wire rop
                            Types of Spliced Eyes
                            The best and safest eye splices available are these.
                            Rolled Eye or Flemish Eye
                            Tucked Eye
                            Fold Back Eye
                            The best and safest eye splices available are these. The Flemish eye with pressed metal sleeve is the greatest of all and is advised for use in all rigging and hoisting because, when constructed properly, it develops about 100% of the breaking strength listed in the catalogue.
                            A steel or aluminium sleeve that is pressed into place protects the strand ends of the spliced eye from the live rope part. 
                            The hand splicing serves as a backup in case the sleeve fails, and the tapered end of the sleeve allows the splice to cross over obstacles without snapping. As a result, the splice's strength is not solely dependent on the sleev
                            Ferrules Method
                            Hand splicing wire rope demands expert labour and long hours and risks operator injury and material damage. On the other hand, mechanically spliced slings can be created quickly utilising a splicing machine and ferrules made of steel or an aluminium alloy
                            Additionally, mechanical ferrule splicing includes:

                                Making slings prevents wires from fraying and unravelling.
                                SWLs, rated capacities, and other information that is physically stamped into the ferrule can be used to identify slings.
                                When constructed properly, attachment is far more powerful than wire rope.

                            Mechanical Splice and Swivels
                            Mechanical Splice
                            Swivels
                            Pass a straight or conical ferrule made of steel, aluminium alloy, or both over the end of the wire rope to create a mechanical splice. Reposition the rope's end in the ferrule so that it forms the proper size eye or is placed over a thimble. To get the metal to flow around both pieces of the rope, place the ferrule in a swaged press and apply pressure.
                            Rigging and Lifting Devices: Fittings
                            When the ends of a wire rope are modified by a type of splice or the installation of fittings, the wire rope becomes an assembly. Now we will discuss some important parts used in rigging and lifting:
                            Collets
                            These chuck-like hollow clamping devices create a collar around the wire rope to be held and apply a powerful clamping force when the rope is tightened, locking the rope's strands and wires. The connections resemble the fold-back eye, but the sleeve is made of a split collet, sleeve, and nut arrangement rather than being swaged on.
                            Place the nut on the wire rope, create a loop with the necessary eye size, and attach the collets to the wire rope to create a collet connection. Place the dead end of the rope at least half its diameter away from the collets.
                            To turn on the nut as far as possible, hold the collets together (by hand). By grasping
                            Sockets
                            When a termination fitting needs to be replaced regularly, a socket is helpful. For instance, if the end of a wire rope is in an area with heavy wear, the rope may need to be periodically trimmed, necessitating the removal and reapplication of the termination hardware.
                            A dragline's ends of the drag ropes serve as an illustration of this. The wire rope's end loop, which is coiled around an additional part known as the wedge, is inserted into a socket's tapered opening.

                            As the load is progressively eased onto the rope, the arrangement is knocked into place. The wedge gets more secure and tightens its hold on the rope as the strain on the wire rope rises.
                            The zinc-poured socket is the strongest wire rope end connection and, when properly fastened, will generate all of the wire rope's strength. Never, however, assume that the splice is more durable than the rope.Making these connections is a skill that needs good facilities and a complete comprehension of the manufacturer's instructions, and should only be left to trained and competent professionals.
                            the rope's live end and pulling on the clamp, you may finally tighten the loop around the thimble. Place the assembly in a vice and tighten the nut while keeping the thimble between the clamp and one-half to one rope diam
                            Types of Sockets and Thimbles
                            The following are the types of sockets available:

                                Zinc Socket or Spelter Socket
                                Swaged Sockets
                                Cappel Sockets
                                Wedge Sockets

                            Thimbles: There is a chance that the wire rope will bend excessively tightly when it is terminated with a loop, especially if the loop is attached to a device that disperses the load over a small area.

                            To maintain the loop's natural shape and shield the cable from pinching and abrasion on the inside of the loop, a thimble can be added. The industry standard is to employ thimbles in loops. The thimble keeps the load's direct line of sight from the wires.
                            Clips (Clamps)
                            Using cable or clips is the most typical way to create an eye or attach a wire rope to a piece of equipment.

                            Clipped eye terminations, when made correctly and in accordance with the manufacturer's Clip Installation Tables, will develop around 80% of the wire rope strength.
                            Things to Consider While Using Clips

                                When employing clips, make sure the corrugation in the saddles matches the rope lay being used‚Äîleft-lay clips for left-lay wire ropes, and right-lay clips for right-lay wire ropes, respectively. Otherwise, the ridges between the forging's corrugations will run perpendicular to and between the wire rope's strands rather than straight. When the clip nuts are appropriately tightened, this will cause the wire stands to cut.
                                Allow no slack in the wire rope between the clamps in either direction.
                                Never join two straight lengths of rope directly with any form of clip. If such a connection is required, construct an eye with thimbles in each length using clips, then join the eyes.
                                Never use clips to join two straight lengths of rope.
                                To prevent the rope from wearing in the eye and to create a more secure connection, always construct an eye using a thimble.
                                Never reuse clips for connections; doing so will prevent them from developing the proper efficiency.
                                Lifting and Hoisting Instruments: Derricks
                                Cranes, derricks and forklifts are some tools that have been around for a very long time. In accordance with their design capability, these instruments can move huge loads weighing up to several hundred tons both vertically and horizontally, load and unload big objects, and erect lofty structures.
                                In this topic, we will get to know different lifting and hoisting instruments and understand their best practices.

                                Derricks: A derrick is a tool made of one mast, or a comparable element, that is hinged flexibly at the bottom and supported at the head by guys or braces, either with or without a boom.
                                It is controlled by (often four) lines that are powered by manual labour or motors so that the pole is capable of moving in all four directions. Like a crane, a line with a hook at one end runs up the mast and over its top.
                                Types of Derricks
                                Basic Derrick:  A two-drum winch typically drives the hoisting and topping actions of a derrick. The topping action is not necessary when the boom is simply used for lifting and swinging; instead, a fixed rope guy line is employed. 
                                Although the derrick's winch can be placed at any height, it is frequently found at the floor level of the boom foot.
                                Chicago Boom
                                The Chicago boom, which is mostly used during new high-rise construction projects, enables the economical and effective movement of objects that might be too big or heavy to be lifted using traditional hoist cages.

                                With the boom stepped in a fixed socket secured to the upright and structural beam connections or bracing, acting as the rigid legs, the device is typically attached to an exterior upright element of a structure that serves as the mast.
                                The load, boom, and boom point swing line fall are all fully assembled on the derrick. With lifting capacity ranging from a quarter ton to around 35 tons, Chicago boom lengths range from 10 to 125 feet.
                                The majority are made of steel tubing, trussed or latticed angle iron, or a combination of both.
                                To provide for adequate clip spacing, always turn back the appropriate amount of ro

                            Guy Derrick
                            In essence, the guy derrick is a Chicago boom that has a built-in mast and is supported vertically by guy ropes. The usual procedure calls for placing six guy wires evenly spaced all around the derrick. The mast and boom of a man derrick are typically made of latticed steel components. 
                            The typical mast and boom lengths are 25 and 100 feet, respectively, though these might vary depending on the use. 200 tons can be lifted with ease.
                            Cranes
                            A crane is a special tool that can lift and lower things as well as move them horizontally. It is furnished with a winder, wire ropes, and sheaves. It makes use of one or more simple devices to generate mechanical advantage and move loads faster than a person could on their own.
                            There are countless different types of cranes, each designed for a particular purpose.

                            Types of cranes:
                            Mobile Cranes
                            Crawler-Mounted Cranes
                            Wheel-Mounted Cranes
                            A steel truss or telescopic boom is mounted on a mobile platform, which can be rail, wheeled (including "truck" carriers), or caterpillar tracks, in the most basic types of mobile cranes. The boom may be lifted and lowered using hydraulic cylinders or cables, and it is hinged at the bottom. Wire rope and sheaves support a hook from the boom's peak.
                            Electric motors and internal combustion engines are just two of the many transmissions that can be used to drive the wire ropes; however, today's norm is electronic control of hydrostatic drives
                            Lesson Summary

                                When the legs are in a true 90¬∞ vertical position, and the D/d ratio is 25:1.
                                Vertical hitch is the most fundamental level hitch.
                                A double-line hitch is perfect for longer loads that are difficult to balance with only one sling.
                                A double choker hitch consists of two slings in a choker hitch to increase the surface area where the weight can be secured.
                                A choker hitch is an effective way to secure a sling and increase load management to cinch it down.

                                Forged alloy steel and load-rated kinds should be used for overhead lifting and hoisting.

                                Wire ropes' ends can be secured from fraying using eye methods to increase their utility.

                                General Safety Guidelines for Scaffolding
                                The following rules, which are intended to enhance safety in the building, dismantling, and usage of scaffolds, must be read and followed by all scaffold users. These recommendations do not claim to be exhaustive, nor do they intend to supersede or replace other extra safety and precautionary measures to address common or uncommon circumstances.
                                     A competent individual must do a survey of the job site to look for risks such as ditches, debris, high tension wires, unsecured apertures, and other dangers left behind by other trades.
                                    Never use any tools that are broken or otherwise flawed. Label it or tag it as broken. Take it off the job site.
                                    Scaffolds must be erected in line with the manufacturer's instructions or the design.
                                    Never erect, disassemble, or modify a scaffold without the guidance of a qualified individual.
                                    Avoid misusing or abusing the scaffolding's equipment.
                                    Users should regularly check erected scaffolds to ensure that they are kept in a safe state. Any risky situation should be reported to your manager.
                                    Do not take a chance! Seek help from the scaffold supplier if you are unsure about the scaffold's use or safety.
                                    Disassembling Scaffolding
                                    To disassemble scaffolding, operators must follow the safety instructions below:
                                        Before starting the deconstruction process, make sure that the scaffolding hasn't been structurally altered in a way that would render it unsafe, and if it has, reconstruct where necessary. All scaffold ties are included in this.
                                        Before removing a component, think about the impact it will have on the rest of the scaffold.
                                        Keep extra parts and equipment off the level that is being disassembled.
                                        Removing ties shouldn't be done before taking down the scaffold above.
                                        Don't just throw the disassembled parts off the scaffold; lower them carefully.
                                    However, because equipment and scaffolding systems are different, it is important to always refer to the guidelines provided by the equipment's supplier or manufacturer
                                    Maintenance of Scaffold
                                    The majority of system scaffold manufacturers offer contractors daily and monthly inspection checklists, which they advise them to follow.

                                    To maintain a well-maintained scaffold, a capable employee who is trained and knows what to look for should pay attention to the following topics of concern:
                                        Every time the scaffold is put up, check it out. Cross-bracing and the scaffold's accuracy are simple things to examine while it is mounted on the wall because issues are extremely obvious that way.
                                        Consider the components used to create the majority of the changeable scaffolding. The preferred material is heavy-duty structural steel, which produces sturdy scaffold structures that, when employing the right tools, are typically not too difficult to store and carry.
                                        It is impossible to prevent finish wear on the scaffold. Sandblasting and repainting may be required depending on the climate and how frequently a particular elevating scaffold system is used.
                                        The scaffold must be taken out of operation if the steel has any kind of damage that affects its strength or ability to maintain it straight and level.

                                Bronze bushed lubricates itself.

                                The load should not be lifted if the ferrule is loose.

                                Scaffoldings
                                Scaffolds and ladders are practically always used in construction work to let personnel access and work in areas that would otherwise be unreachable. However, unless access to such work is problematic by ladder or any other means, scaffolds are rarely cost-effective for work at heights of less than 30 ft.
                                In order to support people and materials during the construction or restoration of buildings and other large structures, scaffolding is a temporary framework that provides a secure area to work in and safe access that is appropriate for the activity being done.
                                Although built-up wooden structures and wood planking have historically been used as scaffolding materials, the majority of scaffolding today is made up mostly of seamless steel or extruded aluminium tube welded panels, as well as steel or aluminium tubing and couplers.

                                Types of Scaffold
                                Single Point Scaffold
                                A platform with moving parts that can be moved to the required work levels and is supported by overhead support by a single rope. A bosun's chair is another name for the most popular of these. 
                                These single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds are designed to support up to 113.5 KG of weig

                            Portable Ladders
                            Portable ladders are among the most practical and basic instruments used. Ladders are utilised for a wide variety of jobs by a wide variety of people due to their usefulness. Although ladders are generally straightforward, using them securely requires forethought and caution.
                            Types of ladders: Portable ladders are "one-person" instruments with the strength necessary to hold the worker and all of his tools and materials.
                            Stepladders
                            Portable ladders are stepladders combined with steel, wood, aluminium, or fibreglass. They are available in an A-shape model with wide steps typically 3 to 10 inches deep, lined with corrugated rubber, or have a texture that prevents slipping on one or both sides.
                            For a more fantastic grip, the foot of the ladder should include rubber cups or slip-resistant moulded footpads. Depending on the model, stepladders can support up to 375 lbs of weight and range in height from 1.5 to 20 feet.Some stepladders include wheels at the bottom and a high railing at the top for rolling suppor
                            Categories of Portable Rang Ladders
                            Single Rung Ladders
                            Extension Ladders
                            Sectional Ladders
                            Trestle Ladders
                            The rungs on these ladders must be parallel, level, and evenly spaced, just like the steps on stepladders. Bored wooden ladder rungs that extend at least flush with the outside rail surface should be installed through the side rails. To keep the rung from twisting and to keep it in place on the side rail, the shoulder of each rung should be pressed firmly on the rails. The tenon should then be fastened in place with a nail or an equivalent. To achieve the required strength, rungs on metal and plastic ladders should be tightly attached to side rails.
                            General Safety Guidelines for Portable Ladders
                            Ladders will continue to be safe and functional with proper maintenance and upkeep. Apply a properly chosen clear coating on a regular basis to wood ladders to prevent damage from exposure to the environment. This coating will offer adequate protection for outdoor circumstances.
                            Portable ladders must always be kept in good shape, free of oil, grease, and other slipping risks, and they must be examined frequently and on a regular basis. Visually check every ladder in use every three months at the very least, or if one is used for the first time on a new task. Check:

                                Rungs should be in good shape.
                                Rung joints ought to be tight.
                                Side rails shouldn't have any cracks, bruising, or other damage.
                                It is important to have tight joints between side rails and rungs.
                                Metal pulley bearings need to be oiled periodically.
                                Safety Guidelines for Ladders and Stairways
                                Programs like ladder safety can save lives. Accidents with ladders are typically brought on by poor choice, maintenance, or use rather than by flaws in the product.

                                But to prevent accidents, it's important to plan ahead, choose the right ladder, follow safe working practices, and maintain your ladders properly.
                                    Instability, electrical shock, and crashes are some of the more frequent dangers associated with ladders that can be anticipated and avoided.
                                    Never use the wrong ladder for the job. Before using a ladder, have a knowledgeable person visually inspect it
                                    Verify that ladders are sufficiently long to reach the work area safely.
                                    Label or mark the DO NOT USE sign when any ladders get damaged or need to be replaced.
                                    Never overload ladders more than the manufacturer's rated capacity or the maximum intended load.
                                    Verify that the load rating can sustain the user's weight, materials, and tools.
                                    When working near electrical installations and overhead power lines, stay away from ladders with metallic parts.
                                    Devices for Head, Face and Eye Protection
                                    Whenever necessary, due to process or environmental hazards, chemical, radiological, or mechanical irritants are encountered in a way that can cause injury or impair the function of any part of the body.
                                     It is necessary to supply, utilise, and maintain in a hygienic and dependable state personal protection equipment (PPE) for the eyes, face, head, and extremities, protective clothes, respiration devices, and protective shields and barriers.
                                    Devices for Head Protection:

                                    Employees are required to wear hardhats in situations where there is a chance of things falling from above, bumping workers' heads against immovable objects, or coming into contact with electrical risks accidentally.

                                    Replacement hardhats are required. Hardhats must be kept in good condition, together with their suspensions and liners, and they must be:
                                        Thoroughly checked for dents, fractures, or degradation.
                                        Replaced following a severe strike or electric shock
                                        Devices for Face and Eye
                                        When workers are at risk of eye injury due to flying particles, dangerous substances, projections, or harmful light rays, such as when welding, cutting, grinding, nailing, etc., employers must provide and employees must use suitable eye or face protection (or both). 
                                        When exposed to electrical risks, such as when working on electrified electrical systems, workers are required to wear safety goggles or face shields.
                                        Impact-resistant Safety Glasses
                                        Splash Resistant Goggles
                                        Welding Goggles
                                        Laser Safety Goggles
                                        Employees who are chipping, grinding, cutting, drilling, or doing any other activity where there is a risk of flying chips, fragments, or other particles must wear impact-resistant safety glasses with side shields or impact-resistant goggles.
                                        Hand and Foot Protection
                                        In situations where there is a possibility of wounds, burns, hazardous physical or chemical agents, or radioactive material, employers are required to supply, and employees are required to utilise suitable hand and foot precautions. Work boots or shoes with slip- and puncture-resistant soles should be worn by employees.
                                        For hand protection:
                                            Use impermeable gloves to avoid coming into contact with dangerous substances on your skin, and swap out worn gloves as needed. Get in touch with the glove manufacturer or supplier to find out which glove is best for the chemical.
                                            When using vibrating power tools (jackhammers, chainsaws, etc.), gloves with vibration-damping material in the palms and fingers are essential. The gloves must fit snugly and not increase the grip force needed to control the instrument.
                                            When welding or helping with welding, nonflammable gloves with gauntlets are required.
                                            Insulated rubber gloves are required for live, high-voltage electrical work; nevertheless, they should never be used in place of other necessary safety precautions and must always be covered with outer canvas or leather glove
                                            Lesson Summary
                                                Never use any tools that are broken or otherwise flawed. Label it or tag it as broken. Take it off the job site.
                                                Scaffolds must be erected in line with the manufacturer's instructions or the design.
                                                Three-section metal ladders longer than 72 feet do not comply with standard safety regulations.
                                                Always verify that the ladder‚Äôs load rating can sustain the user's weight, materials, and tools.
                                                Never use the wrong ladder for the job. Before using a ladder, have a knowledgeable person visually inspect it.
                                                People working with acids and other toxic chemicals must wear splash-resistant eyewear.
                                                Always use moist techniques while cutting or controlling dust.
                                                Employees don‚Äôt need life jackets if they are working above water surface.
                                                A formal respiratory protection guideline with worksite-specific procedures must be established and implemented.
                                                Engineering control techniques should be used to prevent atmospheric pollution as much as possible.
                                                When operating higher than 25 feet above the ground or the water's surface, it is permitted to use safety nets instead of a ladder, safety line, scaffold, platform, or temporary floor.
                                                The nets must extend 8 feet beyond the border of the work area.

                                                    Understanding fire
                                                    Fire as a phenomenon is defined by chemical reactions involving exothermic oxidation processes that release heat, light, and various reaction products such as smoke or gases. To fully grasp fire safety practices one must understand all elements essential to fire. An upgrade version of the traditional Fire Triangle serves this purpose and represents these core elements: fuel, heat, oxygen, and chemical chain reactions.

                                                    The fire tetrahedron
                                                    ‚óè  Fuel: This is any substance that can combust when in the right conditions and exposed to sufficient heat. Examples include wood, paper, fabrics, gases, and certain metals.
                                                    ‚óè  Heat: Energy created through combustion can come from various sources - an open flame, electrical sparks, or chemical reactions are just a few sources that provide sources of ignition.
                                                    ‚óè  Oxygen: A component of the air we breathe, oxygen supports combustion. Without sufficient oxygen, a fire cannot start or continue to burn.
                                                    ‚óè  Chemical chain reaction: This is a series of events where the products of combustion react with oxygen to produce heat, which further sustains the reaction.

                                                    When all these elements come together in just the right proportions, a fire can ignite and thrive. 
                                                    Assess the suitability of fire suppression equipment for specific environments
                                            Fire Science and Behaviour

                                            Removing one element at any point will extinguish it; this principle serves as the cornerstone for many different fire-fighting methods.

                                            Fire behaviour
                                            Understanding fire behaviour is essential in fire prevention and control. There are several key aspects of fire behaviour:
                                            ‚óè  Ignition: This is the initial stage where heat, oxygen, and fuel come together to start a fire.
                                            ‚óè  Growth: If conditions are favourable, the fire will grow. This growth may depend upon factors like fuel type and quantity, oxygen availability, and source intensity of heat.
                                            ‚óè  Fully developed: At this stage, the fire has consumed all available fuel and oxygen in the immediate area. It produces maximum heat.
                                            ‚óè  Decay: The fire decreases in intensity as fuel is consumed or as the oxygen supply is restricted.

                                            Understanding these stages can help us take preventative measures and respond effectively if a fire does start.
                                            Fire Science and Behaviour
                                            Conduction: Fire spreads by heating the material, which transfers heat from molecule to molecule.
                                            Convection: Fire spreads through the movement of hot gases or smoke to cooler areas, igniting combustible materials in those areas.
                                            Radiation: Fire emits energy that heats up & ignites combustible materials without needing physical contact.

                                            Understanding fire science and behaviour is essential for effective fire prevention and safety measures. This knowledge will guide you in developing a deeper understanding of the subsequent topics in fire safety, such as fire safety regulations, roles and responsibilities, and risk assessments.

                                            Defining fire safety
                                            Fire safety refers to a set of practices aimed at reducing the destruction caused by fire. These practices may include measures designed to prevent ignition, limit the development and effects of fire should it occur, and ensure safe evacuation procedure

                            Building Construction and Fire Resistance

                            Building design and construction have an enormous effect on fire safety in any given structure. Fireproof materials used strategically can slow the spread of flames and smoke, giving occupants more time to escape while providing firefighters with better conditions to extinguish fires more effectively. Here we discuss aspects of construction that contribute to fire resistance in buildings.
                            Understanding fire resistance in building construction
                            Fire resistance in building construction refers to the ability of building components to resist fire and smoke in an orderly fashion within an allotted period of time. Usually measured as how well passive fire protection systems withstand standard tests for their fireproofness.

                            Individuals living with disabilities may require different accommodations depending on their particular condition. For instance:
                            ‚óè  Mobility impairments may make it difficult for individuals to evacuate quickly or use standard evacuation routes, especially when lifts are not an option during a fire.
                            ‚óè  Hearing impairments can make it challenging to hear conventional fire alarms.
                            ‚óè  Visual impairments can make it difficult to navigate evacuation routes, especially amidst the confusion of a fire.
                            ‚óè  Cognitive or neurological disabilities may make it hard for individuals to understand or remember fire safety procedures.
                            Fire Safety for People with Disabilities

                            ‚óè  Visual alarm systems: In addition to auditory alarms, visual fire alarms, such as flashing lights, can alert individuals with hearing impairments.
                            ‚óè  Audible directional systems: These systems provide verbal instructions to guide individuals with visual impairments safely out of the building.
                            ‚óè  Evacuation chairs: For individuals with mobility impairments, evacuation chairs can aid in safely descending stairs.

                            Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)
                            A Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) is a bespoke "escape plan" for individuals who may not be able to reach a place of safety unaided or within a satisfactory period. PEEPs should be developed with the involvement of the individual and consider their specific needs.

                            Accessibility in fire safety design
                            The design of buildings and facilities plays a crucial role in fire safety for people with disabilities. Accessibility should be considered in all aspects of fire safety design, including:
                            1.  Evacuation routes: Routes should be wheelchair-accessible and clearly marked with tactile and braille signage for individuals with visual impairments.
                            2.  Fire safety equipment: Equipment, like fire extinguishers, should be placed at accessible heights.
                            3.  Safe refuge areas: In multi-storey buildings, designated safe refuge areas can provide a safe place for individuals with mobility impairments to wait for assistance.

                            Collaboration and communication
                            Establishing a safe environment for individuals with disabilities requires collaborative effort from all involved. Communication among those affected, caregivers, and fire safety professionals is vital in understanding needs and implementing appropriate safeguards.

                            In conclusion, ensuring fire safety for people with disabilities involves understan

                                Origin of Petroleum
                                Algae and plants flourished in shallow oceans millions of years ago. The organic material mixed with other sediments and was buried after dying and sinking to the seafloor.

                                The remnants of these creatures changed into what we know today as fossil fuels over millions of years under great pressure and high temperature. Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are all fossil fuels that developed under comparable circumstances. 
                                Petroleum may now be discovered in large subsurface reservoirs where ancient oceans once existed. Petroleum reservoirs can be located on land or beneath the ocean floor. 
                                Massive drilling machines are used to obtain their crude oil. Our goal here is to introduce you to the world of petroleum and its engineering.
                                The production of petroleum from underground reservoirs is the focus of petroleum engineering. This topic will give you a brief insight into the different types of petroleum products used in our lives.

                            Petroleum and Petrochemicals
                            Petroleum is derived from the Latin words for rock (petra) and oil (oleum). It is a fossilised material that has accumulated under the earth's surface from the beginning of time.
                            Crude (petroleum) oil or mineral oil are terms used to describe raw petroleum. It is a combination of numerous organic compounds and is the source of hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and a variety of other paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons, which are the foundation of today's organic industry.
                            Refining crude oil yields a variety of petroleum products such as gaseous and liquid fuels, lubricating oil, solvents, asphalts, waxes, and coke.Thermal and catalytic treatments of these hydrocarbons result in the synthesis of several lighter hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. The hydrocarbon processing sector is separated into three main activities:

                                Petroleum Production.
                                Refining.
                                Petrochemical Manufacturing.
                                Refineries and Petrochemicals
                                Refineries produce cooking gas (also known as liquefied petroleum gas or LPG), motor spirit (also known as petrol or gasoline), naphtha, kerosene, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), high-speed diesel (HSD), lubricating base oils, wax, coke, bitumen (or asphalt), and other products that are mostly a mixture of various hydrocarbons (organic compounds composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen).
                                Pure hydrocarbons or other organic chemicals with a definite number and type of constituent element or compound are produced from the products in refineries in a petrochemical plant (where one or more petrochemicals are produced) or in a petrochemical complex (where many petrochemical products are produced).
                                Petrochemicals are therefore made from petroleum products received from refineries. Plastics, rubbers, synthetic fibres, raw ingredients for soap and detergents, alcohols, paints, medicines, and other products are produced by a petrochemical comple

                            Petroleum Geology
                            The study of the origin, occurrence, transport, accumulation, and exploration of hydrocarbon fuels is known as petroleum geology. It refers to the particular collection of geological disciplines used in the quest for hydrocarbons (oil exploration). 
                            In this topic, we are going to study the topic of petroleum geology which is extremely crucial to understanding the creation of petroleum.
                            Origin of Petroleum
                            Hydrocarbons
                            Petroleum is found in porous rock formations as gas and/or liquid phases. Because both gases and liquids are rich combinations of organic components containing carbon and hydrogen, they are referred to be hydrocarbons in general. These are often found in the Earth's subsurface in porous rocks known as sedimentary basins. Gas, oil, and water cohabit under pressure in the majority of basins, with methane gas at the cap and oil wedged between the gas and water.

                            Liquid petroleum oil typically contains dissolved and liquified gases. Heavy, carbon-rich, or bituminous hydrocarbons can also be found at shallow depths in shales (oil shales) or on surface sands. Methane, the most common hydrocarbon gas in nature, is also readily available from the coal base. Large amounts of methane may also be found as hydrates beneath the seabed in the Arctic area, which are known as gas hydrates.

                            Migration of Oil
                            Types of Hydrocarbons
                            Crude oil is a complex combination of several hydrocarbon compounds as well as inorganic contaminants.

                            These hydrocarbon compounds are as follows:

                                Paraffinic hydrocarbons.
                                Naphthenic hydrocarbons.
                                Aromatic hydrocarbons.
                                Asphaltene hydrocarbons.


                            Paraffinic (or alkane series) Hydrocarbons
                            The following table displays paraffinic or alkane series hydrocarbons. Alkane series hydrocarbons are made up of simply hydrogen, and carbon atoms joined together by single bonds.
                            Examples of Alkane Series Hydrocarbons:
                            Hydrocarbon Atoms Formula
                            The number of hydrocarbon atoms contained in the molecule is represented by the following formula:
                            NH = 2Nc+2
                            In this formula, NH represents the number of hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule, whereas NC represents the number of carbon atoms.
                            The molecule's molecular weight grows as the number of carbon atoms increases. Lower molecular weight alkanes, such as methane and ethane, are the most prevalent hydrocarbon components of natural gas; however, intermediate molecular weight alkanes up to butanes may also be present.

                            In addition to these hydrocarbon components, natural gases may contain inorganic contaminants such as:
                            C02, H2S, N2, and 02
                            Naphthenic (or saturated cyclic) Hydrocarbons
                            These hydrocarbons, like alkanes, are made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms connected by single bonds; but, unlike alkanes, they form cyclic (ring) structures rather than chain structures. The table below contains examples of naphthenic hydrocarbons.
                            Examples of Naphthenic Hydrocarbons

                            Asphaltene Hydrocarbons
                            Asphaltene hydrocarbons are the final type of hydrocarbon molecule present in crude oil. These hydrocarbons are big molecules with a high molecular weight that may contain elements other than hydrogen and carbon, such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Asphaltenes are the primary components of asphalt (road paving), tar, and bitumen products and are primarily produced as a byproduct of the refining process. The combination of these hydrocarbon molecules can have a variety of effects on oil and gas production, transportation, and refining. These are some examples:
                            Bulk Fluids

                                1. The hydrocarbon molecule combination provides the bulk fluids (oil and gas phases) the qualities that determine how easily or difficulty they flow from the reservoir towards production wells and via production equipment.
                                2. The nature of any materials that may precipitate from bulk fluids onto rock grains, wellbores, or surface equipment during production, generating operational issues that necessitate alternative solutions:

                            Reservoir Rock and Fluid
                            Petroleum engineers working in the oil and gas industry's upstream sector must perform their assessments on the known features of the reservoirs and reservoir fluids linked to the oil and gas fields they are entrusted with managing.
                            These petroleum experts are most likely to use the following properties during their careers:

                                Rock properties.
                                Fluid properties.
                                Rock-fluid interaction properties.

                            In this topic, we will learn about these properties of reservoirs.

                            Compressibility
                            In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the city of Long Beach, California, sank as oil and water were drawn from the underlying formations, most notably the Wilmington Oil Field.

                            The depth of sinking, or subsidence, varied from inches to 29 feet. Damage to roads, buildings, and wells caused significant concerns. The area saw extensive floods. The compression of the pore volume in the subsurface formations caused the sinking.
                            Pore volume compression occurred concurrently with considerable oil and water production and pressure reduction in producing formations. Since the mid-1960s, oil companies have been compelled to inject around 1.05 barrels of water into the Wilmington Field for every barrel of oil and water produced. 

                            The injection of water halted surface sinking. The majority of the lost surface elevation has now been restored
                            Reservoir Engineering for Oil Reservoirs
                            Reservoir Engineering is a Petroleum Engineering Discipline that deals with reservoirs and oil accumulation in general. Reservoir engineers work with other petroleum professionals, such as drilling engineers, production engineers, and geologists, to optimise oil output from the reservoir or field as a whole.
                            Estimating the original oil-in-place, or STOOIP (Stock Tank Qil Originally In-Place), analysing current production rate and pressure trends from the wells and reservoir, forecasting future performance based on these trends, and determining the Estimated Ultimate Recovery, or EUR, of a well, reservoir, or field are typical tasks performed by reservoir engineers working on oilfields.
                            Estimation of STOOIP Using the Volumetric Method
                            The Volumetric Method for STOOIP estimates the volumes of in-place fluids using static geology data estimates (crude oil, natural gas, and water).
                            Static data are those that do not vary over time as a result of oil and gas production. These static data are calculated using core and log data.
                            The Gross Rock Volume (total rock volume of the reservoir zone of interest) and average values of porosity, fluid saturation, Net-to-Gross ratio (ratio of the volume of the productive reservoir to the total rock volume, i.e., the ratio of the volume of the reservoir that contributes to flow to the total rock volume) and fluid formation volume factors are used for the volumetric method (Bf).

                            While these properties can be established at the well locations on a point-by-point basis using core and log data, development geologists employ specialised geological modelling techniques to derive inter-well parameters and averaged values of these variables.

                            Lesson Summary

                                Petroleum is a fossilised substance that has formed under the earth's surface since the dawn of time.
                                Petrochemicals are made from petroleum products received from refineries.
                                Petroleum and petrochemicals are essential to modern civilisation, and the disappearance of petroleum will imply the end of our contemporary society.
                                Petroleum engineering is an interdisciplinary engineering discipline that focuses on the exploration and exploitation of petroleum products.
                                Petroleum engineers power the globe through collaboration and an innovative approach.
                                The combination of different hydrocarbon molecules can have a variety of effects on oil and gas production, transportation, and refining.
                                A reservoir is a section of a geological trap that contains oil and/or gas.
                                Petroleum reservoirs are classified according to initial reservoir pressure.
                                Porosity, compressibility, and permeability are among the reservoir rock properties that development geologists and reservoir engineers are most interested in.
                                Pressure, temperature, composition, specific gravity, gas-liquid ratio, viscosity, compressibility and formation value factor are the basic reservoir fluid properties.

                            Reservoir Engineering for Oil Reservoirs
                            In this topic, we will talk about Reservoir Engineering for natural gas reservoirs. Reservoir engineers working in gas fields undertake similar responsibilities to those conducted in oil fields.
                            Estimating the original-gas-in-place, or OGIP, analysing current production rate and pressure trends from wells and reservoirs, forecasting future performance based on these trends, and determining the economic recovery and the Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) of a well, reservoir, or field are all part of these tasks.
                            Estimation of Original Gas In-Place, OGIP
                            Estimation of Original Gas In-Place, OGIP, Using the Volumetric Method
                            The Volumetric Method for OGIP is practically the same for gas reservoirs. The method calculates the volume of the reservoir's pore space using static geology data. Once the pore space volume is estimated, the gas formation volume factor, Bg, can be utilised to calculate the OGIP.
                            The Gross Rock Volume
                            The first equation, like the oil volumetric equation, is evaluated at starting pressure and saturation conditions because the desired outcome is the original in-place volume. Similarly to the volumetric oil equation, the net-to-gross ratio in the volumetric gas equation is simply the thickness fraction that converts the total reservoir thickness to the thickness that contributes to hydrocarbon storage and flow.
                            We utilise thickness to calculate the net-to-gross ratio because rock formations form in layers during deposition, and we expect that layers of low-quality reservoir rock may be deposited and intermixed with layers of high-quality reservoir rock.

                            The gross rock volume can be further defined as follows:
                            Flow in Well Tubing
                            We have already learnt that production engineers are in charge of maximising the production or injection from individual wells. This optimisation entails monitoring the well to see if it can be improved; stimulating the well with acidising or hydraulic fracturing if there is well damage; using the artificial lift (gas lift or pumps) to improve the economics of low-rate wells; performing well workovers to shut off excess gas or water production; and a variety of other well interventions. 

                            To comprehend how wells are operating, we must first study tube hydraulics (flow behaviour in production or injection wells).
                            Gas and Liquid Flow through Well Tubing
                            Tubing is the pipe or conduit that transports fluids from the reservoir to the surface in the oil and gas industry. This is depicted in the figure below. The diagram also illustrates a conventional vertical well's Wellbore Schematic. 

                            A schematic cross-section of the well's axis is also shown there. This diagram depicts two types of pipe, casing and tubing.
                            Standard Metrics for Well Lengths and Depths
                            This diagram depicts four standard metrics for well lengths and depths used in the oil and gas industry:
                            TVD	TVD is the depth (or length) measured in the true vertical direction from the Kelly Bushing to the point of interest.
                            TVD ss	True Vertical Depth sub-sea (TVD ss) is the depth (or length) measured in the true vertical direction from the mean sea level to the place of interest.
                            MD Distance	Measured Depth is the distance (or depth) measured from the Kelly Bushing to the point of interest.
                            KBE	The Kelly Bushing Elevation (KBE) is the elevation of the Kelly Bushing from sea level.
                            Once the well is put into production or injection, these measures can have a substantial impact on the tubing hydraulics. Gravity (and hydrostatic pressure) and the geothermal gradient, for example, act in the true vertical direction (TVD), whereas friction acts over the entire length of the tubing (MD).
                            Flow Regimes for Vertical Flow
                            Several Flow Regimes or Flow Patterns can occur in the tube as oil enters the well and begins to flow upwards. The flow patterns in vertical flow are depicted in the figure below.
                            Well Intervention
                            Several tasks performed by production engineers will be discussed in this topic. We will specifically cover the well design, well orientation and well completion design.

                            Asset Teams comprised of Development Geologists, Drilling Engineers, Production Engineers, and Reservoir Engineers build the majority of fields and reservoirs. 
                            The responsibilities of each team member frequently overlap with those of other disciplines; nonetheless, the production engineer is primarily responsible for the tasks described above.
                            To demonstrate the overlap, the team develops the entire field development strategy based on their own expertise and skills. The development geologist and production engineer will design the well based on the anticipated geology.
                            Well Design
                            The most important well-design concerns are:

                                Well costs.
                                Tubing and completion longevity.
                                Well simplicity and reliability.
                                Ability to achieve all (or most) of the objectives of the well.

                            The oil and gas industry, like all industries, is concerned with keeping costs as low as feasible.
                            This is true for well designs that are intended to be as low-cost as possible while yet keeping the well safe for people and the environment. The duration, or life span, of the well and completion, is a crucial part of low expenses. 
                            While altering tubulars and well completions is routine in the oil and gas industry, multiple, regular changes go counter to the principle of low costs.
                            Flexibility in Well Design
                            The endurance of the equipment and the flexibility of the well to manage changing reservoir conditions are two features of well design that contribute to a longer life span. Reduced pressures caused by fluid production, lower production rates caused by lower pressures, and changing Gas-0il Ratios (GOR) and Watercuts (fw) over the reservoir's life are all examples of changing reservoir conditions.
                            Flexibility in well design comprises the ability of the initial design to accommodate all predicted reservoir changes or, if this is not possible, designing the original completion to be able to be adjusted to handle these changes at the lowest possible cost.
                            Finally, the well must be capable of achieving its objectives. Other than oil or gas production, the well can be built to achieve a variety of goals. These are some examples:

                                Sand control for reservoirs composed of unconsolidated reservoir rock or rock prone to Fines Movement (the movement of fine-grained elements within the rock).
                                Zonal isolation for reservoirs with numerous zones (to allow each zone to be shut down individually if necessary).
                                Well stimulation in reservoirs with limited permeability or those that are prone to well damage; and artificial lift for low-rate wells.

                            Well Design Considerations
                            Expected Production Rate
                            The primary well consideration is the reservoir's expected production rate. The pressure drop for a given tubing size is proportional to the rate of production (or rates for multi-phase flow). The reservoir pressure in a naturally flowing well must be high enough to pull reservoir fluids up the well and deliver them to surface facilities. As a result, the generating rate must be considered when sizing the tubing.

                            Reservoir Geology
                            Unconsolidated Reservoir Rock
                            Drilling Contracts and Rig Crew
                            The international Oil and Gas Industry's Exploration and Production (E&P) segment is most likely the riskiest in terms of capital intensity, extended payback periods, technological dependence, and a slew of legal/environmental compliance requirements.
                            One of the most significant contracts for an operator is the drilling contract. A drilling contract will allocate some risks (including personal injury, property damage, certain pollution risks, and consequential damages) on a reciprocal basis, regardless of fault.
                            Other hazards, such as well control, downhole pollution, loss or damage to the hole or downhole tools, and reservoir damage, are frequently assumed to some extent by the operator.
                            The drilling crew is the group of workers who run the drilling rig. A driller is a drilling crew member who operates a drilling rig. The drilling crew is in charge of drilling wells as well as operating and maintaining heavy machinery. The drilling crew is the group of workers who run the drilling rig.
                            Life Cycle of Oil or Gas Fields
                            Most oil and gas fields' typical life-cycle can be divided into five stages:

                                Exploration Stage.
                                Appraisal/Delineation Stage.
                                Development Stage.
                                Plateau Stage.
                                Decline Stage.
                                Abandonment Stage.
                                Life-Cycle of a Hydrocarbon Field
                                The following diagram depicts the life-cycle of oil and gas fields. Drilling engineers are required at all stages of the life cycle.

                            Life Cycle of Oil or Gas Fields
                            1. Exploration Stage
                            This stage evaluates undrilled acreage to identify its potential for future commercial development. Exploration Geologists and Geophysicists (among others) develop prospects for future evaluation during the exploration stage of field development. Following the generation of these prospects, exploration wells are drilled to determine whether hydrocarbons exist at the places identified by geologists.
                            2. Appraisal and Delineation Stage
                            Exploration wells have a statistical success rate of 25 to 45 per cent (identifying commercially viable hydrocarbon reserves). When a well encounters a crude oil or natural gas reservoir, it is recognised as the reservoir's Discovery Well. This marks the commencement of the field development's Appraisal and Delineation Stage. Wells are drilled during the Appraisal and Delineation Stage of field development to give data for Development Geologists to evaluate the newly discovered reservoir.

                            Appraisal Wells are wells drilled in the reservoir's interior that are used to collect information from Core Analysis, Well Logging, and Well Test. These can be used to analyse important reservoir properties and create trend maps of these properties, such as depth, thickness, porosity, water saturation, permeability, and so on. Delineation Wells are wells drilled near the reservoir's periphery that are
                            3. Development Stage
                            This stage begins once the development geologists and reservoir engineers believe the reservoir has been appropriately evaluated and identified. All of the wells required for the preliminary Field Development Plan are drilled, finished, and connected to the production facilities during the development stage.

                            Multiple drilling rigs may be operating concurrently during this time in order to drill and complete all production wells, injection wells, and possibly observation wells necessary by the development plan on time.
                            After the field has been put into production, the wells produce into fixed-capacity production facilities. If the production potential of all development wells exceeds the surface facilities' production capacity, then production will be limited by the capacity of the production facilities. (In other words, the facilities operate as a bottleneck in the system, and the wells must be produced at a lower capacity than their potential.)
                            As reservoir pressure is low, the wells' prospective production capacity decreases (due to reduced drawdown), and they can no longer produce oil at full capacity. (In other words, the reservoir pressure eventually drops to the point where the wells become the system's bottleneck.)
                            4. Plateau Stage
                            Because the facility capacity is relatively stable over time, the early era of production, when the facility capacity is the bottleneck, is sometimes referred to as the Plateau Stage of production (barring any upgrades or additions to the facilities). There is a lot of action going on behind the scenes to maintain the facilities running at full capacity. The reservoir pressure will begin to fall when production begins due to fluid withdrawals.
                            Furthermore, as time passes, undesirable water or gas production may grow, necessitating Well Interventions (Workovers).

                                Infill wells may need to be drilled.
                                Completion designs may need to be adjusted.
                                Wells may need to be stimulated.
                                Water or gas shut-off workovers may be required.
                                Artificial lift may be required.
                                Secondary production techniques may be employed; and so on.

                            As a result, many reservoir management actions may be required during this plateau period to keep the facilities fully
                            Lesson Summary

                                The Volumetric Method for OGIP is practically the same for gas reservoirs, and it calculates the volume of the reservoir's pore space using static geology data.
                                There are three driving mechanisms related to conventional gas reservoirs and a fourth drive mechanism associated with unconventional gas reservoirs.
                                Horizontal wells provide an appealing alternative to vertical gas reservoirs for effectively depleting tight gas reservoirs and achieving high flow rates.
                                In case of Horizontal Gas Well, the gas flow is calculated using the effective wellbore radius.
                                Tubing is the pipe or conduit that transports fluids from the reservoir to the surface in the oil and gas industry.
                                Oil and gas wells (or fluid injection wells) are not usually straight and vertical. Straight, deviated, or horizontal wells can be designed.
                                A Directional Survey is the measuring of a well's three-dimensional route in the field.
                                There are several flow regimes or flow patterns for vertical and horizontal flow.
                                The most important well-design concerns are well costs; tubing and completion longevity; well simplicity and reliability; ability to achieve all (or most) of the objectives of the well.
                                The factors must be addressed when designing a well: Expected Production Rate; Reservoir Pressure; Reservoir Geology; Low Permeability of Reservoir Rock; High Temperature and Pressure; etc.

                            Lesson Summary

                                The well completion is the lowermost part of the well, made up of tubulars and downhole equipment.
                                Artificial lifts may be necessary to produce the wells at economic rates.
                                Most oil and gas fields' typical life cycle can be divided into five stages.
                                Wells are normally drilled by a Drilling Company or Drilling Contractor who specialises in drilling operations.
                                The Day-Rate Contract and the Turnkey Contract are two of the most frequent contract types utilised in the oil and gas industry.
                                Numerous rig crews are required to operate a rig constantly during drilling operations.

                            The Drilling Rig
                            Oil and natural gas drilling rigs are used not only to discover geologic resources but also to drill holes that allow oil or natural gas to be extracted from those reservoirs. Once a well has been drilled, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well, and a service rig (a smaller rig designed just for completions) will be put onto the well to bring it online.

                            This frees up the drilling rig to drill another hole, simplifies the procedure, and allows for the specialisation of specific services, such as completions vs drilling.
                            The Drilling Rig
                            Different types of drilling rigs are classified below:

                                Cable Tool Rigs
                                Rotary Rigs:

                                Conventional Rotary Rig or Rotary Table Rig or Kelly Drive Rig.
                                Top-Drive Rig.

                            Offshore Drilling Rigs

                                Cable Tool Rigs
                                The first drilling rigs utilised for hydrocarbon wells were cable tool rigs.

                                They were used to dig shallow hydrocarbon wells in the Appalachian region of the United States in the second half of the nineteenth century (1800s).

                                Although these rigs are no longer employed for modern oil and gas well drilling, they are historically significant.

                                Schematic Diagram of Cable Tool Drilling Rig
                                Cable tool rigs were first employed to drill water wells in the United States in the early 1800s, although their origins can be traced back to ancient Chinese and Persian civilisations' percussive drilling techniques. They were modified for drilling hydrocarbon wells in the mid-to late-1800s. A cable tool drill

                            Cable Tool Rigs
                            Cable-tool drilling is done by raising and dropping a string of tools on the end of a cable. The up and down motion is imparted by the walking beam. The tools are pulled from or lowered into the hole by winding or unwinding the drill cable on the bull wheel. Casing is raised or lowered by the casing line and calf wheel. The cuttings are removed from the hole by the bailer, which is raised and lowered by the sand line and reel.
                            The cable tool is essentially a heavy metal chisel suspended from a wire cable, which is connected to a spring pole or Walking Beam (similar to a lever and fulcrum system). Using the spring pole or walking beam, the cable tool is repeatedly elevated and allowed to drop (free fall) down the wellbore, causing the rock to fail at the point of impact at the bottom of the well. When there is an accumulation of rock fragments at the bottom of the wellbore, water is put into the hole and Bailers are lowered to remove the rock cuttin
                            Rotary Rigs
                            Torque (rotation) is imparted to the Drill Pipe or Drill String (hollow steel tubing) with a drill bit attached to the end of the Bottom-Hole Assembly in a rotary rig (BHA). The bottom-hole assembly, as the name implies, is attached to the bottom end of the Drill String, closest to the formation being drilled.

                            The drill string is the total length of drill pipe extending from the drilling rig's rotary system to the bottom-hole assembly at the bottom of the wellbore. The BHA is equipped with everything needed to drill the current portion of the wellbore. 

                            Drill collars (heavy steel tubing used to impart weight to the drill bit), directional drilling equipment, LWD or MWD tools, and other items may be included.

                            We will discuss two types of rotary rigs. They are:

                                Conventional Rotary Rig or Rotary Table Rig or Kelly Drive Rig.
                                Top-Drive Rig.

                            gs and debris.
                            Bailers were traditionally merely buckets used to raise trash from the wellbore to the surface. Modern bailers are low-pressure instruments that run on wireline or slickline with a sealed compartment.
                            When the compartment is opened, a surge of hydrostatic pressure fluids into the low-pressure chamber transports the sand and drilling debris into the bailer. The tool is then elevated to the surface.
                            Conventional Rotary Rig
                            A conventional rotary rig, also known as a rotary table rig or kelly drive rig, is a drilling rig in which the drill string and bit are rotated by a rotary table on the rig floor. The typical rotary rig was the most frequent rig used in the previous century (1900s), and it is likely that you are most familiar with it from old movies and documentaries. The following schematic diagram depicts a standard rotary drilling rig.

                            The Derrick or Mast (Item 14) is the tall steel structure with its base on the rig floor, as seen in the diagram. This illustration also shows the Kelly (Item 19), the Kelly Bushing (not shown), and the Turn Table or Rotary Table (Item 20) on the rig floor. On a traditional rotary rig, these are the components of the Rotary System that deliver torque to the drill string.

                            The kelly is a hollow square or hexagonal section of pipe that allows the drill pipe to pass through. The kelly bushing is raised above the rig floor and is paired to a similarly shaped bushing (square or hexagonal). Consider the kelly to be a hollow square or hexagonal bolt, and the kelly bushing to be a matched square or hexagonal wrench used to turn the bolt.

                            The kelly bushing is held in place by four huge metal pins in the master bushing, which is then held in place by the rotary table. The torque necessary to rotate the master bushing, kelly bushing, kelly drill pipe, and drill bit is provided by the rotary table.
                            Drilling Rig System and Drilling Process
                            In the last few topics, we learned about Rig Contracts, the Rig Crew, and Different Drilling Rigs. In this topic, we will continue our discussions of the drilling rig and start a discussion on the drilling process.
                            These rigs have different applications and there are pros and cons for each, but there are many similarities. We will continue our discussion on drilling rigs with these similarities.
                            Major Systems on a Drilling Rig
                            While there are several types of drilling rigs, they clearly have many similarities since the duties they do are identical. All modern hydrocarbon rotary rigs, in particular, include five major systems. 

                            These are the systems:

                                The Power System.
                                The Hoisting System.
                                The Rotary System.
                                The Circulation System.
                                The Well Control System (Blowout Prevention System)

                            The Hoisting System
                            The drilling rig's hoisting system accomplishes the hard lifting. It is used to raise, lower, and suspend the drill string, as well as to lift casing and tubing into the well. The hoisting system is made of the following components in the detailed rig schematic:

                                The Crown Block (Item 1)
                                The Mast/Derrick (Item 2)
                                The Monkey Board (Item 3)
                                The Traveling Block (Item 4)
                                The Hook (Item 5)
                                The Swivel (Item 6)
                                The Drawworks (Item 13)
                                The Weight Indicator (Item 14)
                                The Drilling Line (Item 39)

                            Petroleum and the Environment
                            When fossil fuels‚Äîcoal, oil, and natural gas‚Äîare utilised, they can impact the ecosystem. Surface coal mining damages the ecosystem until the area is reclaimed. When oil is spilt on land or at sea, it pollutes everything it comes into contact with.

                            Images of wildlife covered in oil or natural gas showing up in drinking water have contributed to the public's image of oil and gas as "dirty" energy sources.
                            The combustion of fossil fuels produces environmentally hazardous byproducts. It's easy to conclude that fossil fuels have always been bad for the environment.
                            However, if we look at the history of energy use, we can see that when fossil fuels were first adopted by civilisation as a primary energy source, they helped safeguard the environment. In this topic, we will discuss the environmental aspects of fossil fuel production and consumption.
                            Anthropogenic Climate Change
                            Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most pressing environmental issues confronting mankind today.

                            Carbon combines with oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides when a carbon-based fuel burns in the air (often abbreviated as NOx). 

                            Unconfined combustion byproducts, such as water vapour, are discharged into the environment in gaseous form.
                            Because they absorb heat energy, some gaseous combustion byproducts are referred to as greenhouse gases. Water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are examples of greenhouse gases. Infrared light can be absorbed by greenhouse gas molecules. When a greenhouse gas molecule absorbs infrared light in the atmosphere, the energy of the absorbed photon of light is converted into the kinetic energy of the gas molecule. The following figure depicts the greenhouse effect, which is caused by an increase in air temperature
                            oncentration of Greenhouse Gases
                            Specific Greenhouse Gas
                            Climate Change
                            The CO2 Value
                            Greenhouse Gas Emissions
                            The concentration of greenhouse gases can be measured in one approach by measuring the concentration of a specific greenhouse gas. In 1958, Charles David Keeling began measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii's Big Island. Since beginning his measurements, Keeling has noticed a steady increase in carbon dioxide content. His curve, now known as the Keeling curve, is depicted in the figure below. It has an annual cycle in carbon dioxide concentrations that is overlaid by an increasing average.
                            The initial carbon dioxide concentration was little more than 310 parts per million. It is now at 400 parts per million. These measurements show that carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing since the middle of the twentieth century.
                            The Future of Energy
                            The global energy mix is shifting away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable energy sources. Recognising that oil and gas are nonrenewable resources, rising energy demand, concerns about the security of oil and gas supply, and the likelihood of anthropogenic climate change are all spurring changes in the global energy mix.
                            We will describe the global distribution of oil and gas production and consumption in this topi, introduce M. King Hubbert's notion of peak oil, and analyse the significance of oil and gas in the future energy mix.
                            Reserves
                            The magnitude of a resource tells us how much of it is contained in a deposit. The amount of resources that can be extracted is referred to as reserves. The definition of reserves is defined in the Society of Petroleum Engineers' Petroleum Reservoir Management System (SPE-PRMS, 2011). The following table summarises the reserve classifications.
                            SPE-PRMS Reserves Definitions
                            Proved Reserves
                            Those quantities of petroleum, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from a given date forward, from a given date forward, known reservoirs, and under defined economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. There should be at least a 90% probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate.

                            Possible Reserves
                            Oil and Gas Resources
                            Oil and gas resources are classified as conventional or unconventional. Snyder and Seale (2011) defined conventional oil and gas resources as formations capable of producing profitable flow rates or volumes of oil and gas without the need for stimulation treatments or specialised recovery methods and technologies.
                            Unconventional oil and gas resources are formations that cannot produce profitable flow rates or volumes of oil and gas without stimulation treatments or specific recovery procedures and technology. The image below depicts a classification of oil and gas resources that adhere to these principles.

                            Lesson Summary

                                The first drilling rigs utilised for hydrocarbon wells were cable tool rigs.
                                The two most common rotary drilling rigs are Conventional rotary table rig and Top-drive rig.
                                A jack-up drilling rig is a rig with three or more (typically three) retractable legs that can be used to jack the rig up above the wave action of the water surface.
                                Jack-up rigs can be used in water depths of up to 400 ft. of water; can be used to drill wells to a Total Depth (TD) of 30,000 ‚Äî 35,000 ft.
                                Semi-submersible rigs can be used to drill wells in water depths up to 9,500 ft.
                                The power system is the system that provides all power to the rig.
                                The hoisting system is the system that does the heavy lifting on the rig.
                                The circulation system of the drilling rig is responsible for circulating the drilling fluid from the mud pit to the drill bit and back.
                                The rotary system of the drilling rig provides the torque for the drilling process.
                                The Well Control System, or the Blowout Prevention System, is the system on a drilling rig that prevents the uncontrolled, catastrophic release of high-pressure fluids (oil, gas, or salt water) from subsurface formations.

                                    Introduction to Vehicle MET Technician
                                    MET Technicians are specialists that carefully restore client vehicles to factory standards by identifying and repairing issues and delegating work to other specialists as needed. They may work as part of a team or independently, and a more senior technician usually oversees them. This module will provide a brief overview of MET Technicians.
                                    Who Is a MET Technician?
                                    Vehicle Mechanical, Electrical, and Trim (MET) technicians work in the vehicle body repair sector of the automotive industry and are responsible for locating damaged components in cars that have typically been in accidents. They are also known as body fitters, body shop mechanics or body shop technicians.
                                    The task of MET technicians is to locate any mechanical or electrical components that are damaged on a damaged car or light commercial vehicle, remove them, and then replace them both before and after body repair work is done.
                                    Working Processes of MET Technicians
                                    Here's the typical working processes of MET technicians:
                                        At first, MET technicians remove and replace all mechanical, electrical, and trim components.
                                        Then, the panel technician and paint technician repair the vehicle's body and paint.
                                        After that, the car is returned to the MET technician, who replaces any new suspension or cooling system components as well as restores any damaged parts that were not damaged in the first place.
                                    Indicate the types of car alignment and explain how to align a car.
                                    Day-To-Day Responsibilities
                                    While the nature of the work varies depending on location, some typical day-to-day responsibilities of MET technicians include the following:
                                        Removing and installing basic mechanical, electrical, and trim components.
                                        Replacing non-structural body parts after removal.
                                        Replacing and refitting mechanical and electrical systems as well as car trimmings after an accident.
                                        Assessing the extent of vehicle damage.

                                            Education and Training
                                            The following paths can be taken to become a qualified MET technician:
                                                Employment - Finding employment with an employer who offers a training programme that includes training at properly equipped facilities.
                                                Apprenticeship - Combining work and study at a nearby college or training facility, typically on a day-release basis.
                                                Full-time College Course - A full-time course that combines classroom instruction with hands-on activities
                                                Beginning the Career
                                                The majority of technicians begin their careers with an apprenticeship or training course. In today's budget cuts and high tuition costs, going to university and continuing education may not be the best option for everyone, and many employers may not require a degree where experience and work-based skills are more valuable. 
                                                An apprenticeship will provide individuals with the work knowledge and qualifications they need to earn while they learn without accumulating debt. Applying for an apprenticeship requires GCSEs in math, English, and science.
                                                Pre-apprenticeship training is offered by the Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) to pupils between the ages of 14 and 16. 
                                                With recognised Level 1 Technical Certificates within the Apprenticeships and Advanced Apprenticeships frameworks, the training offers a quick path to progressing into a full Apprenticeship.

                                Body Panel Alignment
                                The term "auto body panels" refers to the collection of big steel parts that are fitted around the vehicle. These steel pieces shield the car's parts and systems from the elements and safeguard the occupants in the event of an accident. 
                                This module aims to give you an overview of how to align the major body parts of a car.
                                The Chassis
                                The body of an automobile requires a strong structure, and the suspension system requires an anchor point; the chassis fulfils b
                                Types of Chassis
                                Chassis comes in two varieties, which are:
                                Conventional/Body-On-Frame
                                Integral/Unibody
                                This might be a single frame or two separate frames attached together. To maintain other automotive components in alignment, this sort of chassis is built with extreme rigidity. 
                                Even though they are becoming less common, vehicles with conventional chassis still perform better off-road because they can tolerate twisting forces better.
                                Functions of the Body Panel Parts
                                Each component of an automobile's body has a distinct purpose, some of which are listed below:
                                Hood
                                The hood shields the engine from foreign objects and other dangers, such as rain and h
                                Functions of the Body Panel Parts
                                Header Panel
                                They are composed of sheet metal, plastic, or fibreglass and are positioned over the bumper. 
                                They serve as the link between the grille and the headlights.
                                Windshield Cowl Panel
                                Lower Door Skin
                                Rocker Panel
                                Aligning the Major Body Panel Parts
                                Cars often have an unbalanced fender gap and obvious misalignment between body panels. 
                                With older automobiles and trucks, consistent and accurate body panel alignment can become problematic with time. Fortunately, fixing the issue is not difficult when the proper approach is used.
                                Fender
                                The door-to-fender gap, which can also be impacted by the fender-to-hood gap, makes it difficult to align the fender. A technician should always use the factory-supplied adjustments; further adjusting the specified slots is never recommended.
                                A bent fender mounting flange may be present when there is a large fender-to-hood gap. The fender mounting flange must be reformed by pulling the fender toward the vehicle's centre line.
                                Installation of a Car Door
                                The installation of a door can be difficult. You must adjust the latch if it is out of alignment when closed and latching.
                                Sometimes the door's latch mechanism is the element that can be adjusted; other times, the latch pin on the door pillar that the latch engages needs to be adjusted. It only requires a small amount of attachment hardware lubrication, a light tap of the latch or pin to approximate the correct position, tightening, and trying again. With this technique, you can move the back edge of the door in, out, and up and down.
                                Older cars sometimes have hard-to-move hardware. Hardware that is held together by Torx or hex head bolts typically breaks down in the presence of penetrating oil or some light hammer tapping.
                                Vehicle Suspension
                                Suspension is the system of tyres, tyre air, springs, shock absorbers, and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows them to move relative to one another. The purpose of a car's suspension is to increase the amount of contact between the tyres and the road, give good handling and steering stability, and assure the comfort of the passengers. In this module, you will learn about the fundamentals of the vehicle suspension system.
                                The suspension system connects the vehicle body to the wheels. Its purpose is to:
                                    Locate the wheels while enabling them to steer and move up and down.
                                    Minimise road noise and keep the wheels in contact with the pavement.
                                    Distribute the vehicle's weight among the wheels.
                                    Reduce the weight of the vehicle as much as possible, especially the unsprung mass, which is resistant to the impacts of steering, braking, and accelerating.
                                    Function in tandem with the tyres and seat springs to provide optimum ride comfort.
                                    Understanding Vehicle Suspension System
                                    A vehicle's suspension system is necessary to absorb and dampen road shocks. This makes the passengers more comfortable and guards against load and vehicle component damage. A spring positioned between the wheel and the car's body allows the wheel to follow the surface of the road. The tyre is crucial in absorbing small road shocks. It is frequently referred to as the primary suspension mechanism. Between the body and the wheel axles are springs that support the vehicle body. These components, along with the damper, are referred to as the suspension system.
                                    The springs in the suspension system absorb road movement or shock. The spring stores the energy of the action. The actual spring can take on a variety of shapes, from a steel coil to a nitrogen-pressurised chamber. Soft springs are the most comfortable, although stiff springs can be ideal for good performance. 
                                    Therefore, vehicle springs and suspension are designed to strike a balance between comfort and effective handlin
                                    Active Suspension
                                    Like many other developments, active suspension or electronic management of suspension originated in the Formula 1 racing world. It is currently gradually gaining popularity in production cars. Traditional suspension systems are usually a trade-off between soft springs for comfort and harder springs for better cornering. Active systems can switch between the two extremes.
                                    Conventional Suspension System
                                    A typical or conventional suspension system, which consists of springs and dampers, is passive. In other words, its features remain the same when it is put in the vehicle. The main advantage of a traditional suspension system is its predictability. 
                                    Over time, the driver will become acquainted with the suspension of a vehicle and will learn its capabilities and limitations. The downside is that the system has no way of correcting conditions that are not within the scope of its original design.
                                    Advantages of Active Suspension System
                                    Active suspension offers these main advantages:
                                        Improvements to ride comfort, handling, and safety.
                                        Predictable vehicle control in various situations.
                                        Handling is the same whether the vehicle is laden or empty.
                                    The advantages are substantial, and as component prices fall, the system will be offered on a wider range of cars. In the near future, it's anticipated that more off-road vehicles will likely be equipped with active suspension.
                                    Continuous self-adjustment is a feature of an active suspension system. It keeps an eye on the road conditions and modifies its characteristics accordingly. Sensors provide data to an electronic control unit (ECU), which then outputs to actuators, as is the case with all electronic control systems. Active suspension delivers better handling, comfort, responsiveness, and safety by adapting its properties in reaction to shifting road conditio
                                    Removing Dampers
                                    Many contemporary automobiles have front suspension systems with an upper wishbone- shaped arm attached to the inner wing or an outrigger and a lower wishbone arm attached to the chassis. The dampers are typically installed between the inner wing or outrigger and the lower wishbone arm. 
                                    Some manufacturers put the bottom damper on the upper wishbone. The damper is often positioned within the coil spring when the wishbone suspension uses one. However, removing the damper without removing the coil spring is possible.
                                    The Coil Spring and Damper
                                    The coil spring and damper may be combined on some vehicles, in which case the spring must be separated and attached to the new damper. Sometimes the coil spring needs to be compressed before the damper is removed from the car, especially where it contacts the upper wishbone. 
                                    Before you remove the damper from the car, the lower wishbone on either a coil-spring or torsion-bar suspension must be jacked up to relieve pressure on the damper bolts.
                                    Replacing Coil Springs
                                    Replacement coil springs for the front suspension must have the appropriate rating if a coil spring needs to be changed. Additionally, it is preferable to replace both of the front springs because it's possible that one of them does not exactly match the new spring's grade. 
                                    Check with your local dealer about the rating. Painted marks typically identify springs in different colours
                                    Lesson Summary
                                        Vehicle Mechanical, Electrical, and Trim (MET) technicians work in the vehicle body repair sector of the automotive industry. 
                                        MET Technicians are responsible for locating damaged components in cars that have typically been in accidents.
                                        Consideration of sensible clothing should be given when working on a car. The same kind of thought should be given to hair during any kind of close-contact work with an automobile or engine.
                                        A hydraulic lift or industry-standard jack may be available in a professional environment, but this should only be operated by those who are trained to do so.
                                        The body of an automobile requires a strong structure, and the suspension system requires an anchor point; the chassis fulfils both of these demands. 
                                        Chassis comes in two varieties, which are conventional/body-on-frame and integral/unibody. Vehicles with conventional chassis can tolerate twisting forces better. Unibody frames are not recommended for off-road driving.
                                        Fenders are the arc-shaped parts that surround each wheel cutout on the side of a car. They shield the body from the substances that the tyres throw while driving, including snow, debris, dirt, and other substances.
                                        Cars often have an unbalanced fender gap and obvious misalignment between body panels. The door-to-fender gap makes it difficult to align the fend

                                            SRS stands for Supplemental Restraint System, and it refers to safety restraints such as airbags and seat-belts in the car. The SRS system uses two different types of codes: soft codes and hard codes.
                                            The acronym OBD stands for On-Board Diagnostics. It is a system that keeps track of data, reports any issues it finds, and monitors the operation of an automobile's emissions and engine systems.The second iteration of this system for vehicles and trucks is called OBD2. OBD-II codes come in four separate categories: P, B, C, and U.

                                            The dampers are typically installed between the inner wing or outrigger and the lower wishbone arm. The dampers are loaded with specific oil that causes dampening.
                                            Car alignment is a procedure that aligns the wheels by modifying various suspension system components. The manufacturer of each car specifies standardised alignment angles in degrees. A car alignment typically takes 60 to 90 minutes to accomplish if no suspension parts need to be replaced.
                                            When the alignment is off, the tyres do not point in the same direction. The angle that a car's rear wheels point toward the centre of the vehicle is referred to as the thrust angle.

                                Lesson Summary
                                The key learning points from this module are;

                                    A single muscle fibre is a cylindrical, elongated cell. Muscle cells can be extremely short or long. 
                                    Thousands of muscle fibres are wrapped in a thin layer of connective tissue called the perimysium to form a muscle bundle. Groups of muscle bundles that join into a tendon at each end make up a muscle (e.g. biceps muscle).
                                    Components of the muscle cells: The cell membrane, Contractile proteins, The cytosol, Mitochondria, and Capillaries .
                                    There are three types of muscles in the body: smooth (intestinal wall and arteries), cardiac, skeletal.
                                    For contraction to occur, a nerve impulse must be sent from the brain. 
                                    The nerve that goes to the muscle is called a MOTOR NEURON. Motor neurons are responsible for stimulating a number of muscle fibres - together they are called a MOTOR UNIT.
                                    Muscles work in pairs. The AGONIST is the working muscle. The ANTAGONIST is the relaxing muscle.
                                    The heart is situated almost dead centre in the middle of the chest.
                                    Heart rate is usually in direct ra

Technology skills are not always referred to having vast knowledge on complicated things such as C++ or HTML but knowing how the technology of your industry, office and other social media can make you indispensable.
                                        A method to strengthen a relationship between your boss and you is to execute a positive attitude and willingness to do anything. For example, you receive a good position in a company, but you receive a task way beneath your educational credentials and background. Fulfilling that task can show your competencies and build an excellent reputation.
                                        Emotional intelligence is how you can manage your own emotions and be aware of others emotions. We also vie who EQ beats IQ. It is crucial to cultivate EQ to manage negative emotions because it will affect us in our work life as well as our social life.
                                        Time management is a crucial soft skill for any career. This skill comes to effect when arriving at work early. It is essential to consider potential issues such as traffic, car problems, a full bus, etc.
                                        It is probable that you have heard "dress for success" "Clothes make the man or woman". Although we live in the 21st century, this may come as a cliche, but it still affects how people view us. It is vital to dress appropriately according to the circumstance. For example, you will most certainly not wear a Halloween costume for an important meeting.

                                    What is Sous Vide?
                                    Sous vide (pronunciation: sue-veed) is a popular cooking technique that originated in France. Sous vide means under the vacuum and implies the vacuum-sealing of food in a bag. After the food has been sealed, it is cooked at a precise temperature in a water bath. Sous Vide cooking technique is helpful in cooking food to the desired level of doneness. 
                                    Why Should Cooking be Done via Sous Vide Method?
                                    Traditional cooking methods do not provide chefs with enough temperature control. This often leads to food being overcooked from the outside while remaining almost raw (or undercooked) from the inside. Foods cooked with these methods can become dry and chewy, tasteless, and undesirable for the eaters. 
                                    In contrast to these traditional cooking methods, Sous Vide provides chefs and cooks with the required control over their cooking. It comprises precise temperature control and circulation to the cook, leading to numerous benefits.
                                    How is Sous Vide Beneficial?
                                    On this page, we will list some of the major benefits associated with sous vide cooking:
                                    It Produces Consistent Results
                                    Cooking with Sous Vide means cooking foods at a fixed temperature for a fixed amount of time. This leads to very precise and consistent results. For example, if a customer wants a medium-done steak, then the sous vide cooking method will provide them with exactly what they want. In contrast, it is possible with traditional cooking that some parts of their steak end up being raw, others being well done, while the rest of the steak gets medium rare. 
                                    It Enhances Taste of the Food
                                    It Reduces Food Waste

                                Different Types of Sous Vide Machines
                                Sous Vide equipment has often been bulky and hard to carry, making it almost inaccessible for amateur and home-based chefs. However, recent innovations in its design have introduced more sleek, economical, and easy-to-use equipment. Please keep in mind that this course on Sous Vide cooking technique is very beneficial for you, whether you are a home chef or a beginner chef aspiring to begin your professional journey in a renowned hotel chain. 
                                By taking this course and acquiring insight into Sous Vide cooking techniques, you can build the foundations of your culinary expertise easily. To be a master in the Sous Vide technique, you must be aware of the important equipment and machines used in this technique.
                                The Immersion Circulator
                                This standalone immersion circulator heats the water and circulates it evenly across the pot. They take up very little space, as they don't have a built-in water bath. Furthermore, they do not require any additional equipment and you can easily clamp and adjust it on the side of a pot you already own. Examples of some renowned manufacturers of Sous VIde immersion circulators include Sansaire, ChefSteps, Anova, Nomiku, and Joule.

                                Sous Vide Water Oven
                                Sous vide water ovens are often referred to as countertop water baths. They are almost a size of a microwave oven and are used to heat water. However, unlike immersion circulators, they cannot circulate the water around, resulting in inconsistently textured food. Some of the well-known water oven manufacturers are AquaChef, SousVide Supreme, and Gourmia.

                                    Different Packagings in Sous Vide
                                    Sealing food is very crucial in Sous Vide cooking. It prevents evaporation and efficiently transfers energy from the heated water to the food. To seal food in Sous Vide, you need to:
                                        Place your food in a plastic bag.
                                        Remove the air using water immersion technique, a vacuum sealer, or a straw.
                                    A vacuum sealer is not mandatory in Sous Vide, and air can be evacuated using other methods as well.

                                Sous Vide and Food Tenderness
                                Although we have discussed different benefits of Sous Vide techniques earlier, it is essential to mention the effects of Sous Ride On increasing food tenderness. Food in Sous Vide is cooked at relatively low temperatures, thus avoiding bursting of the cell walls (in plants). Similarly, the tough collagen in the animal meat can be easily broken down without the fear of wasting the meat's protein by excessive heat. 
                                This is one of the most notable downsides of the traditional cooking methods, where meat gets heated so much that it loses its protein content, thus:

                                    Making it less nutritious.
                                    Reducing its moisture content.
                                    Making its texture tough and hard.

                                As you may have guessed, traditional cooking methods provide with very small tenderness window, thus making it very difficult to achieve the desired tenderness. However, Sous Vide offers the desired tenderness in cooking food below boiling temperatures. This retains vegetables' crispiness while making the meat tende
                                Demerits of Sous Vide
                                Sous Vide cooking also comes with some mentionable demerits.
                                Increased Cooking Time
                                Absence of the Maillard Effect
                                Sous Vide technique increases cooking time significantly. For example, a tender beef cut can be prepared within minutes with a pan. But with Sous Vide, it would take somewhere between one and four hours. 
                                Similarly, a boneless chicken breast can be prepared in half an hour in an oven, but it would take four hours with Sous Vide. 
                                Mitigating the Demerits of Sous Vide

                                    While cooking with Sous Vide may take very long, it keeps and secures all the taste and moisture. Also, the temperature with Sous Vide remains controlled, thus excluding the need of constant supervision.
                                    You can still provide your foods with the Maillard Effect by browning them before (or after) the water bath. To do so, you can either grill it or use a blowtorch to sear it in a pan.

                                Beginning with Sous Vide
                                Compared to traditional cooking, Sous Vide offers many benefits while cooking food. This means you can get a flexible schedule and even leave your house for some time to carry out a chore while your meal gets prepared in your kitchen without fearing getting overcooked. 
                                To make the most of your Sous Vide cooking, it is essential to gather all the necessary equipment and utensils beforehand. These utensils include:

                                    Souse Vide circulator.
                                    Cambro 8-Quart storage counter.
                                    Cast iron skillet.
                                    Deluxe vacuum sealer.
                                    Sous Vide Circulator
                                    We have previously mentioned the Souse Vide heat circulators. These portable devices can be clamped onto your container to circulate heat evenly around the water. Sous Vide circulators most chefs use come with the same degree of heating accuracy.

                                Cambro Containers and Iron Skillets
                                This page mentions the use of Cambro containers and cast iron skillets while cooking your food with Sous Vide
                                Cambro Container
                                If you are preparing a meal for more than a few people, you can opt for a large plastic container. However, these plastic containers cannot replace the Cambro containers in terms of efficiency. A 4.75-gallon Cambro container provides enough space to cook up to ten chicken breasts or steaks simultaneously. 
                                Cast Iron Skillets
                                Meats can be made crusty with the Sous Vide technique. To do so, you'll require the cast iron skillet and a propane blow
                                Vacuum Sealers and Binder Clips
                                Vacuum sealers and binder clips may not be mandatory components of your Sous Vide gear, but having them by your side can be very helpful. 
                                Vacuum Sealers
                                Binder Clips
                                Vacuum sealers are required to seal your freezer bags, and ensure they are tightened with water-tight seals occasionally. Regarding bags, it is essential to remember that you must use zipper-lock freezer bags. 
                                If you use the seal-on-thinner bags, chances are very high for them to be degraded in long-sustained temperatures. The most renowned vacuum sealers are Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro and Nesco VS-12 Deluxe Vacuum Sealer. However, if you cannot have vacuum sealers, using zipper-lock freezer bags can mitigate your problem. 
                                Common Queries Related to the Sous Vide Technique
                                This page answers some of the most important queries concerned to Sous Vide cooking:
                                When Should the Meat be Seasoned with Salt?
                                How to Manage Highly Variable Time Ranges?
                                Adding Fresh Aromatics to Sous Vide Bag
                                Botulism in Sous Vide
                                Salt is not just a flavoring agent. It can also dissolve muscle proteins and alter the meat's texture. Therefore, storing the meat with salt for a long time can alter its texture. While this texture is acceptable for meats like fish and chicken, many people find it repulsive for beef. To avoid this, you can season it with salt immediately before or after cooking (and before searing). 
                                Temperature Control in Sous Vide
                                Meats have a very special place in the Sous Vide method of cooking. However, it is essential that the meat is cooked, that keeps all of its nutrition and taste. This also means making the meat safe to consume, which cannot be achieved without adequate temperature control. Let's begin by understanding the cooking of bagged food kept in the freezer for a long time.
                                Is It Okay to Cook Bagged Food Taken Out From the Freezer Immediately?
                                Cooking the bagged food taken out from the freezer should not pose any problem during the Sous Vide process. However, giving it some extra time to get thawed can be beneficial during the cooking process. If you take a thick steak or chop from the freezer, give it at least thirty minutes to thaw. Similarly, chicken breasts or small shrimp can get thawed within 15 minutes.
                                Chilling and Reheating the Food for Sous Vide
                                When you make your food pass through the first session of Sous Vide cooking higher temperature for several hours, the contents of your sealed bag almost become sterile. This implies that rapid chilling (from an ice bath) and rapid reheating must not pose significant health risks. However, quick-cooking meats, such as chops, chicken breasts, fish, shrimp, etc., can become dry because of this repeated heating and cooling. Henceforth, it is highly recommended to cook such foods immediately before your sear
                                Torching the Meat
                                Torching and searing the meat creates a layer of crust over the meat, providing it with a crispy and tasty outer layer. In traditional cooking methods, meat is often seared after initial cooking (or frying). But if you want to prepare a Sous Vide meat and sear it twice, i.e., before placing it in the Sous Vide bag and after taking it out, then you must know that it does not produce any significant changes in the taste. Pre-searing (searing the meat before placing it into the bag) can overcook the meat from its outer edges. Therefore, it is ideal to;

                                    Place the raw meat in the bag.
                                    Make it go through the Sous VIde process.
                                    Sear it after the Sous Vide procedure has been done.

                                Using the Torch Only to Sear the Meat
                                We recommend against using a blow torch directly on the meat to sear it. Doing so will cause uneven browning and crisping of the meat. Besides, the naked flame from a butane or propane torch provides the meat with a gasoline-like aroma that can be unpleasant. However, if you use a pre-heated skillet while searing the meat, then combusting the fuel from the torch would become easier. Also, the fat and juices in the pan will nullify the effect of any uncombusted fuel still left over in the pan.
                                Sous Vide Recipes
                                Until now, you have received all the important information concerning the Sous Vide method and its various techniques. In this topic, we will how you can use Sous Vide to prepare beef steaks and chicken breasts. 
                                Sous Vide Steaks
                                Steaks are one of the basic food items that Sous Vide enthusiasts try their hands on. Undoubtedly, the traditional cooking method can prepare your streak the best way. Yet, there are still high chances of your pricey steak getting burned. The Sous Vide method allows you to cook your steak to your desired doneness level. 
                                It doesnt matter if you are an experienced Sous Vide chef or not. Setting your cooker's temperature to 130¬∞F or 54¬∞C will give you a medium rare steak.

                                Steps to Sous Vide a Steak
                                The steps to make your steak go through a perfect Sous Vide process are as follows:
                                Step 1 - Preheat your Precision Cooker
                                Begin by preheating your precision cooker according to the table given on the second page.
                                Step 2 - Season Your Steak
                                Step 3 - Add your Aromatics
                                Step 4 - Seal the Vacuum Bag
                                Steps to Sous Vide a Steak
                                Once you have Sous Vide your steak, take it out from the water in the vacuum bag. Gently place it on a plate lined with a paper towel and pat it dry on both sides. A Sous Vide steak is free from any browning on its surface. However, you can add this feature (along with crispiness) afterward. To sear your steak, perform the given steps as follows:
                                Steps of Searing the Steak

                                    Set your cast iron or stainless iron skillet over the hottest temperature of your burner.
                                    Add a tablespoon of canola, rice bran, or vegetable oil.
                                    Wait till the oil gets hot and smoke starts coming out of it.
                                    Lay down your steak in the skillet gently. Here, you can add butter; since it contains milk solids, you can easily blacken and char your steak faster. Also, this method will provide your steak with a slightly charred and bitter flavor.
                                    At this stage, you can add aromatics to your steak, such as shallots, rosemary sprigs, thyme, crushed garlic cloves, or sliced shallots, etc. Flip the steak after 15-30 seconds and keep flipping it every 15-30 seconds until it sears nicely. This process should get completed within a minute and a half max.

                                    Texture	Temperature	Timing Range
                                    Soft and juicy, if served hot	140¬∞F (60¬∞C)	11/2 - 4 hours
                                    Tender and juicy chicken breast, ideal for preparing chicken salad if served cold. Slightly stringy if served hot	150¬∞F (66¬∞C)	1- 4 hours
                                    Traditional texture, a bit stringy, juicy and firm when served hot	160¬∞F (71¬∞C)	1- 4 hours

                                Step 5 - Cook the Steak 
                                Cooking a Chicken Breast Sous Vide - (Part A)
                                The steps for Sous Vide preparation of chicken breasts are as follows:
                                Step 1 - Preheat the Precision Cooker
                                Just like you did while preparing the steak, preheat your precision cooker according to the temperature chart given on the previous page.
                                Step 2 - Season the Chicken Breast
                                Step 3 - Insert the Chicken in the Vacuum Bag
                                Step 4 - Seal the Bag
                                Step 5 - Cooking the Chicken
                                Step 6 - Remove the Chicken from the Sealed Bag
                                Cooking a Chicken Breast Sous Vide
                                After taking chicken breast out of the vacuum bag, you can proceed to place it on the preheated cast iron skillet. 

                                    Set your cast iron or stainless iron skillet over medium-high heat.
                                    Coat its base with a tablespoon of canola, rice bran, or vegetable oil. Wait until the pan shimmers. Very high temperatures are not required while searing a chicken breast, as its skin is a natural insulator.
                                    Add the chicken breast to the skillet gently. You can achieve the best results by using a slotted fish spatula to hold the chicken against the pan's corner. This will maximize the contact between the chicken skin and the pan metal. You can also tilt the pan slightly to pool the fat and oil underneath the chicken.

                                Now, remove the chicken from the pan and wait two minutes for it to cool down a bit. Remove its bones and use a sharp chef's knife to carve out the chicken into three or four thick slices of serving size.

                                Common Queries Related to Sous Vide Technique

                                    When Should the Meat be Seasoned with Salt: Storing the meat with salt for a long time can alter its texture. If you want to season beef with salt, use salt immediately before or after cooking (and before searing). 
                                    Managing Variable Time Ranges: You can cook your meal above 130¬∞F (or 54¬∞C) for longer hours, as it will not pose any significant health risks. However, you must avoid cooking longer than four hours below 130¬∞F temperature. 
                                    Addition of Aromatics to Sous Vide Bag: Regarding the addition of aromatics to the Sous Vide bag, you must remember that not everyone will like the concentrated flavors of these spices and herbs. Therefore, you should look for alternatives, such as using garlic powder in place of garlic or adding herbs and aromatics in the pan after searing the meat. 

                                Searing the Meat in Sous Vide

                                    Place the raw meat in the bag.
                                    Make it go through the Sous VIde process.
                                    Sear it after the Sous Vide procedure has been done.

                                        Our values and beliefs impact how we relate to, empathise with and engage with others.

                                        Communication and organisational behaviour are significantly influenced by emotions.

                                        Self-awareness is the conscious knowledge of one‚Äôs own character and feelings.

                                        Getting feedback from others and reflecting on your own actions can increase your self-awareness.

                                        SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats involved in a project or in a business venture.

                                        Before setting goals for your career, you need to ask yourself questions such as ‚Äòwhat goals do you have in mind?‚Äô, ‚Äòwhy are you concerned about this?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat significance do they have for you‚Äô?.
                                        A professional development plan (PDP) is a tool that can be employed to prioritise, assess and concentrate on professional development efforts.

                                        To make the decisions necessary to maintain the efficiency of their organisation, managers and leaders must be able to recognise work priorities.

                                    The key points covered in this module are:
                                        During the first six years of life, children develop rapidly. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors gained in this period become the foundations of children's future lives.
                                        The six principles that should be taken in mathematics education are equality, training program, teaching, learning, assessment, and technology.
                                        Early mathematics skills in preschool education are divided into numerical relations, counting skills, and arithmetic operations.
                                        Children's understanding of numerical changes, the decrease and increase of objects, and the ability to create new quantities are also necessary prerequisites for arithmetic operations.
                                        Individuals acquire mathematical thinking and intuition without being aware of it from the moment of their birth.
                                        Mathematical concepts extend the interrelated connections between symbols, concrete situations, pictures, and language.
                                        Counting principles have five stages: the Cardinal Principle,

                                Below you will find a summary of the key contents covered during the module:

                                    The internet has opened new ways for people to connect with their friends and families, revealing how it plays a central role in young people's friendships.
                                    According to psychologists, there are five stages of friendship development: Momentary physical interaction, one-way assistance, two-way/by the rules, intimate/mutually shared friendships, and mature friendships.
                                    The most popular tools that 8-17-year-olds use to chat with friends daily are youtube, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook or Messenger.
                                    68% of young people said chatting with friends online cheers them up. 
                                    A study measured friendship in six domains: Validation and caring, conflict and betrayal, companionship and recreation, help and guidance, intimate exchange, and conflict resolution.
                                    One of the first electronic educational toys was Texas instruments Speak and Spell, which was released in the late 1970s
                                    Lack of attention, aggressive behavior, greater risk of obesity, sleep disturbances, and cyberbullying are some of the harmful effects of technology.
                                    Hispanic and black students are more likely to attend classes entirely online than their white counterparts.

                                Learning Outcomes
                                Having completed this module you will be able to:

                                    State the ideal age bracket during which we should buy children their first phones and how to manage screen time
                                    Summarize the various types of preventive measures that should be taken before giving children a phone
                                    Analyze how mobile phones can affect a child's health and influence parent-child relationships
                                    Discuss the positive and negative effects of allowing children to bring cell phones to school

                                Lesson Summary
                                Below you will find a summary of the key content covered during the module.

                                    A child can benefit most from screen time when parents and children watch and play together on a device.
                                    It is essential to manage screentime through plans, rules, and limits. Encourage meaningful screen use so that time spent online serves a purpose. 
                                    Children below the age of two should be restricted from using a phone. Children between two to five can start using phones as entertainment platforms. Ages twelve and above can be appropriate for phone usage.
                                    Starting with devices with limited uses can act as training wheels so kids can be provided with something in the future based on good phone behavior.
                                    Microwave radiation from smartphones and other devices can have very harmful effects on children. Other physical and psychological problems can also occur due to excessive smartphone use.
                                    Life360 encourages families to create a circle on the app so that everyone knows where everyone else is at all times.
                                    Cellphones at school can be used to stay in touch with family at all times, manage anxieties and offer learning opportunities.
                                    However, cellphones can also act as a tool for cyberbullying and can have negative side effects on mental health.

                                                    The ideal sources are classified into an ideal voltage source and an ideal current source. For an ideal voltage source the value of internal resistance Rs = 0. For an ideal current source the value of internal resistance Rs = ‚àû.
                                                    Source transformation is a conversion of a voltage source into a current source and a current source into a voltage source. It is useful for solving circuits.
                                                    A voltage source in series with a resistor is transformed into a current source with resistors connected in parallel. Similarly, the current source in parallel gets transformed into a voltage source with resistors connected in series.
                                                    A current source is an independent source that supplies the same current to a wide range of resistances connected across its terminals. The current source is the dual of a voltage source.
                                                    There are two types of parallel connections. They are the Parallel aiding current sources and the Parallel opposing current sources.
                                                    Microelectronics use DC supply for their operation. This is because these circuits mainly consist essentially of transistors like static devices for switching and control operation. The logic circuits require DC supply.
                                                    There are two types of active circuit elements (electrical sources), namely,
                                                    - the voltage source, and
                                                    - the current source.
                                                    An ideal voltage source is an active element that can supply and maintain the same voltage across its terminals

                                    Lesson Summary

                                        Mesh analysis is employed for DC and AC circuits. In DC circuits mesh is used only for resistive circuits.
                                        Mesh is defined as a closed path that does not contain any other loops within it.
                                        The advantage of mesh analysis is that it will reduce the number of equations required to solve the circuits for current and voltage. Mesh analysis employs Kirchhoff's voltage law to solve the planar circuits.
                                        The node voltage can also be used with networks containing complex impedances. In an N node network, the common terminal or ground terminal is chosen as the Reference node.
                                        Node analysis is a useful technique to solve the voltage across various elements of a circuit. In the nodal analysis, independent voltages are solved by writing Kirchhoff‚Äôs current law.
                                        The star-delta transformations are used to establish, equivalence for networks with three terminals. The three elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is eliminated by transforming the resistances.
                                        For equivalence, the resistance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks.
                                        Benefits of 3-phase systems include constant power delivery and that smaller conductors are required for connecting three-phase equipment.

                                        Upon successful completion of this module, you should be able to:
                                            Identify the elements of Thevenin's Theorem in DC circuits.

                                        which gives an expression for the solution of linear equations. This is expressed in terms of determinants.
                                        Lesson Summary
                                            Thevenin's theorem states that "any electrical circuit, exclusive of the load, can be replaced by an equivalent circuit that contains only an independent voltage source in series with resistor such that, the output voltage and current remain same across the load‚Äù.
                                            Thevenin's Theorem states that ‚Äúan entire AC network, exclusive of the load, can be replaced by an equivalent circuit that contains only an independent voltage source in series with impedance such that the output voltage and current remain same across the load‚Äù.
                                            Norton's theorem (DC) states that ‚Äúany electrical circuit consisting of voltage sources, current sources and resistors with two terminals is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single equivalent resistor".
                                            Norton's Theorem (AC) states that ‚Äúany electrical circuit consisting of voltage sources, current sources and impedances is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with single equivalent impedance‚Äù.
                                            The maximum power transfer theorem states that to obtain maximum power from a source with a finite internal resistance of the load must be equal to the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals.
                                            The MPT theorem can be extended to alternating current circuits having reactance. Therein, it states that maximum power transfer occurs when the load impedance is equal to the source impedance.
                                            In any complex electrical circuit, network analysis helps in simplifying the circuits.
                                            Tellegen's theorem can be applied to lumped networks consisting of time variant, time-invariant, linear, non-linear

                                    In this module, you learned:
                                    Introduction to Signal Conditioning
                                    Some of the reasons for needing signal conditioning in mechatronics systems are:

                                        The signal from sensors may be too small to be amplified.
                                        The signal from the sensor contains interference which has to be removed.
                                        Digital signal need to be made analogue or vice versa.

                                    An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a high gain DC voltage amplifier with a differential input and a single-ended output. 
                                    An op-amp usually has feedback from the output to the inverting input. This feedback results in the stabilisation of the amplifier and helps in the control of the gain. 
                                    Most amplifiers are designed to have a large input impedance so that minimal current is drawn from the input.

                                    Ideal op-amp exhibits infinite bandwidth while real op-amp exhibits finite bandwidth

                                    The Global Problem of Fire Safety
                                    Fire-related destructions and accidents are prevalent globally. Despite implementing strict fire-safety laws and regulations, compliance remains poor, and there's a lot of work left that needs to be done in this regard. Fires can incur heavy losses to human lives as well as infrastructure. Households and companies have to bear hefty losses, and millions of dollars are spent every year compensating for the damages. The situation is so grave that even developed countries like the U.S. face the consequences of fire-related incidents due to inadequate fire safety measures.



                                    The following statistics show the damages and destructions caused by the fire alone in the US in 2020:
                                    Types of Fire Incidents in the US (2020)
                                    As per the statistics in the US for the year 2020, it is reported that most incidents have occurred as domestic fire compared with the second most prominent which is vehicle fire. Industrial and commercial fire incidents are covered in miscellaneous. 

                                        The local fire departments responded to 1,338,500 fires. Cumulatively, these fires caused 3500 deaths, 15,200 injuries, and $21.9 billion worth of property damages
                                        Vehicle fires constituted 18% of the fire-related deaths

                                        Of all the fire-related deaths, 74% of the fire-related deaths resulted from domestic fires.
                                        64% of the domestic fires in the US occurred in one-two family homes, while 10% of the fires occurred in apartments or multi-family housing
                                        Every 23 seconds, every fire department in the US responded to a fire in the country. Fires in US homes occurred

                                    The Need of Fire Safety Professionals
                                    Fires are perhaps one of the most notorious hazards due to which thousands of lives are lost each year. Not only that, but these fires also cause substantial financial and infrastructural losses in the places they occur. What is essential in this scenario is that the losses due to fire occur worldwide, despite implementing stringent laws and regulations to curb the fire hazards. 
                                    In this scenario, hiring a fire safety management professional remains among the top priority of businesses and enterprises. This is because the enterprises always want to ensure that their fire safety management is robust. Leaving any loopholes in their fire risk protection systems can cause them losses worth millions of dollars. If a fire occurs in the premises of these buildings, not only do they incur monetary and infrastructural losses, but they also lose their reputation among the general public.
                                    What are the responsibilities of a Fire Safety Professional?

                                        They should be well-aware of the rights, roles, and responsibilities of employees, employers, and the owners of premises during a fire emergency
                                        They must know the local laws related to fire-safety
                                        They should be able to equip the occupants of the buildings with his knowledge and expertise about the fire safet

                                    The National Fire Protection Association
                                    When it comes to fire safety, we see a long list of organizations and associations that make fire safety laws and regulations around the world. However, among these organizations, there are very few that have gained worldwide recognition. One such organization is the NFPA, which was created back in 1896. Now this association is recognized globally for its work related to fire safety in different situations and realities. Many governmental bodies around the world follow NFPA publications for making their own regulations and guidance on fire safety.
                                    When it comes to fire safety and management, NFPA is considered the authority organization. The mission of this organization is to promote safe practices that eliminate the likelihood of death, injury, and property losses associated with fire incidents. The main reason for NFPA's popularity is its more than 300 codes and standards.
                                    The NFPA Codes and Standards and their Purpose 
                                    The sole purpose of NFPA codes and standards is to minimize the risk and effects associated with fire-related accidents and incidents. These codes and standards establish criteria for building, processing, servicing, designing, and installing the buildings and their associated structures.
                                    Why Does a Fire Start?
                                    Fires are one of the most common causes of commercial and residential accidents. The reasons why a fire starts vary. Sometimes, they start just due to utter mishandling. At other times, there are sheer loopholes in the safety and risk prevention systems in factories, industries, and enterprises. 
                                    Below, three of such most important causes are given that cause a fire to happen in the first place. This is more focused on domestic fire in households. However, these reasons can also be found in industrial or commercial fire.
                                    Illustration:

                                    Fires Due to Heating Equipment
                                    With the arrival of winters, the use of heating equipment increases exponentially in homes and offices. Similarly, large industrial plants have their own heating systems. But at times, these systems and appliances can cause an uncontrollable fire. Thus, it is therefore essential to take all the necessary preventive measures before using this equipment. It would be best to use these space heaters only to heat a small portion of the premises. It is also important to keep this space heater away from any substance that can easily catch fire (e.g., blanket, curtain, laundry, furniture, etc.).
                                    Preventing CO Poisoning in Buildings
                                    Practicing carbon monoxide safety at home and in other buildings is also crucial. CO is a toxic gas usually produced by fuel-burning devices, such as a stove or a furnace. You can prevent yourself from dangerous carbon monoxide leaks by installing carbon monoxide alarms on every floor. For additional safety, test these alarms every once in a while and replace their batteries every six months to ensure your and your family's safety.
                                    Unattended Cooking
                                    Unattended cooking is the most prevalent reason why domestic fires start in the first place. If you are cooking in your kitchen or somewhere else in your home, you must ensure presence over the cooking process for the whole time. If it is not possible for you to keep the watch the entire time, then don't hesitate to ask another adult in the house to supervise the cooking process. Also, inserting a timer can help you with keeping track of your cooking time.
                                    Statistics of Losses Due to Unattended Cooking

                                        Cooking equipment account for 47% of the total reported fires
                                        Compared to gas stoves, electrical stoves have a 2.5 times higher chance of catching fire in kitchens
                                        Due to unattended cooking, 47% of the kitchen equipment can catch fire
                                        Unattended cooking causes 45% of the injuries and 20% of the civilian deaths 
                                        Unattended cooking accounted for 50% of the house fires in 2015 in the 

                                    Fires Due to Faulty Wiring
                                    Faulty wiring can potentially start a fire in a building by a short circuit. If you are experiencing any of these signs, you must know that your building has a problem with its wiring. 
                                    Some of the diagnostic signs that indicate faults in your wiring are:

                                        Dimming of the lights while you use another appliance
                                        Being able to use only one device at a time, and
                                        Frequently blown-up fuses, etc.

                                    One of the best ways to prevent electricity-related fires in your house or the factory premises is to hire a qualified and expert technician. This technician can help prevent a severe mishap by locating all the faults in the wirings and power outlets and, thereby, saving you from a major disaster.
                                    The Fire Triangle
                                    The fundamental concept to understand how is a fire is materialized in reality is the fire triangle. Fire triangle explains that there are three most important components in a fire i.e. ignition source (or heat), fuel, and oxygen. The same is depicted in the illustration below:
                                    he Fire Triangle
                                    You can easily understand the elements that make a fire dangerous by looking at The Fire Triangle. The fire triangle is also known as the combustion triangle. It is a scientific principle that explains the essential ingredients of the fires and how fires sustain themselves. A fire triangle comprises of three components, i.e.,

                                        Heat
                                        Fuel, and
                                        Oxygen

                                    Why is the fire triangle important? The fire triangle is an important fundamental concept in fire safety, because it provides the knowledge required to understand how to eradicate fire. By removing any of these three components, you can collapse the fire triangle and extinguish the fire quickly. All fire extinguishers and other devices used to suppress fire are based on the fire triangle. These extinguishers basically remove one of the three components to suppress the fi
                                    Components of the Fire Triangle
                                    Heat
                                    Fuel
                                    Oxygen
                                    A fire ignites in the presence of a heat source. Nearly all the materials can be ignited, but they all have different "flashpoints." A flashpoint can be defined as the lowest temperature at which a material can be ignited.
                                    It would be best to take precautions in the case of fires that start due to combustion reactions. This is because combustion reactions produce heat and further increase the fuel's temperature.
                                    he Fire Tetrahedron
                                    Unlike the fire triangle, the fire tetrahedron also contains one more critical component, i.e., the chemical chain reaction. The fire triangle does not cover it, but the chemical chain reaction is an essential component in the inception and propagation of a fire. 
                                    The Fire Tetrahedron
                                    Just like the fire triangle, the fire tetrahedron is another scientific principle that gives us a basic understanding of the virulence of fires.  The three components of the fire tetrahedron, i.e., heat, oxygen, and fuel, are also part of the fire triangle. However, the new addition in tetrahedron is of chemical chain reaction. The reason for adding a chemical chain reaction as a separate entity in the tetrahedron is that some fire extinguishers extinguish the fire by inhibiting the chemical reaction happening at the molecular level.
                                    The Four Components of the Fire Tetrahedron:

                                        Fuel: Is any substance that can be combusted
                                        Chemical Chain Reaction: Sufficient energy from the reaction that can produce ignition
                                        Oxygen (Oxidizing agent): Air having oxygen
                                        Heat: Refers to sufficient heat energy that can cause combustion

                                    What is Combustion?
                                    Combustion is a chemical reaction that usually includes oxygen and the generation of heat and light as a flame. The reactants' temperature and the reaction's resultant energy are very high, leading to the rapid acceleration of the chemical reaction.
                                    Classification of Flames Produced From Combustion
                                    The flames produced from combustion are of three different types:

                                        Premixed flames
                                        Diffusion flames
                                        Oxidizing and reducing flames

                                    Types of Flames
                                    Premixed Flames 
                                    The flame combustion is dominant in the fuels premixed with an oxidant (e.g., oxygen or an oxygen-providing compound). The flames' temperature resulting from the reaction reaches several thousand degrees. This chemical reaction takes place inside a narrow zone and several micrometers thick. This combustion zone is also known as the flame front.
                                    Diffused Flames 
                                    Oxidizing & Reducing Flames
                                    Different Classes of Fire
                                    There are five classes of fire, and the primary basis of their classification is the fuel on which they are burning. With this classification system, authorities can assess the hazards ad determine the most effective extinguishing agent or equipment required to put out the fire.

                                        Class A Fires: They involve all the common combustibles, such as wood, trash, rubber, and plastics
                                        Class B Fires: They occur due to flammable liquids, such as lacquers, solvents, oil, and its products, gasoline, etc.
                                        Class C Fires: These are caused by energized electrical equipment, e.g., wiring, motors, controls, appliances, machinery, etc.
                                        Class D Fires: Fires in this category are caused by combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, lithium, etc.

                                        The Four Stages of Fire
                                        The International Fire Service Training Association (IFSTA) classifies fire into four stages. these four stages are:
                                            Incipient
                                            Growth
                                            Fully developed
                                            Decay
                                        The Incipient Form
                                        This stage results from the fire being caused by the combination of heat, oxygen, and fuel. It is also called ignition, and the fire in this stage is usually tiny and often goes away on its o

                                        The Four Stages of Fire
                                        Growth
                                        It is the stage during which oxygen and the structure‚Äôs overall fire load work as fuels for the fire. This stage is affected by various factors, such as:
                                            The starting point of the fire
                                            The combustibles in their proximity
                                            Ceiling height of the structure, and
                                            The potential of thermal layering
                                        Although growth is the shortest stage of all four, it can be hazardous for firefighters. A flashover usually occurs during this period to trap, injure, and even kill the firefighters.

                                    Lesson Summary
                                    Three of such most important causes are given reasons due to which fire starts in the firs place are:

                                        Unattended cooking
                                        Heating equipment
                                        Faulty wiring

                                        To avoid fires due to unattended cooking, adult supervision over the cooking process is strictly advised
                                        Heating equipment can emit CO gas. To avoid exposure to CO gas, one must use CO alarms
                                        The important signs of an imminent short circuit are dimming of the lights while using other appliances, not being able to use multiple devices at a given time, and frequently blown-up fuses

                                    What is Combustion?
                                    Combustion is a chemical reaction that usually includes oxygen and the generation of heat and light as a flame.

                                        Fire Protection, Prevention, and Suppression
                                        The collective goals of fire protection, prevention, and protection systems in a building are to protect it from fire and related hazards. Although people may consider these systems the same, there are a lot of differences in their operability and functioning. However, better security is ensured when these three systems work together.
                                        A summary of the differences in the operability of these systems are as follows:
                                            Fire protection systems reduce fire-related damages and help safe evacuation from a building
                                            Fire prevention systems minimize potential fire hazards
                                            Fire suppression systems extinguish the fire flames
                                        What is the Fire Protection System?
                                        The fire protection system protects the building's occupants and/or residents from the damages associated with fires. The overall goal of this system is to provide the best opportunity for safe evacuation and reduce the repair costs as much as possible.
                                        Types of Fire Protection System
                                        Active Fire Protection Systems
                                        These systems and their elements are designed to assist in countering the fires. Examples of active fire protection systems include smoke alarms and water sprinklers.
                                        Components of Passive Fire Protection Systems
                                        Compartmentation
                                        Intumescent Paint
                                        Presence of Non-Flammable Materials
                                        According to fire safety regulations, a building should be compartmentalized into manageable areas. Specialists will take special care of these manageable areas by installing fire doors, walls, and other cavity barriers to stop the passage of smoke.
                                        Fire protection boards also constitute an important part of compartmentation. They absorb heat and do not shrink at high temperatures. Similarly, fire-stopping solutions seal the service penetrations. In case a fire breaks out in a compartment, the insulation of the surrounding compartment confines high temperatures and smoke to a specific area.
                                        The final aim of compartmentation is to limit the spread of heat, smoke, and fire. This method also ensures the protection of the entire escape routes.
                                        What is Fire Prevention?
                                        Fire prevention measures help identify and remove any fire hazards. These systems reduce the fire load of a building. Fire load is the potential of a fire in a building, as per the presence of specific hazards. You can reduce the likelihood of facing a serious fire with fire prevention. When you safely store the combustible materials or when you remain vigilant about ignition points (such as heating systems and plug sockets), you are essentially contributing to preventing a fire from happening. By conducting fire safety inspections regularly, you can identify potential fire safety hazards in any building.
                                        Equation to Calculate Fire Load
                                        Fire load of a building is a calculated value, however, its calculation can vary from region to region. .
                                        Fire load = (Mass * Calories) / Area
                                        What is a Fire Suppression System?
                                        Fire suppressions systems are used as a final resort to prevent fire spread. The primary aim of the fire suppression system is to put out the fire as quickly as possible. If a fire happens, the building's occupants are alerted of it. In contrast, the fire suppression system emits a concentrated substance to suppress the flames.
                                        Composition of the Fire Suppression Substance
                                        Use of Water in Fire Suppression Systems
                                        The composition of fire suppressing substance varies, as it depends upon the environment for which it is designed. The compositions of common chemicals in the fire suppressing system are usually carbon dioxide and inert gases. At the same time, some are composed of liquid and dry chemical agent

                                        Classification of Fire Extinguishers by Content
                                        Based on their content, there are six main types of fire extinguishers:
                                            Water
                                            AFFF foam
                                            CO2
                                            ABC powder
                                            De-ionized water mist
                                            Wet chemical
                                        Each of these extinguisher classes is designed to put out different fire classe

                                                Fire Safety Management Plan
                                                If you are among those who are willing to become a fire safety management professional, then you should be aware of the importance of the fire safety management plan. With a fire safety management plan, you can make arrangements for implementation, control, monitoring, and review of fire safety standards and ensure the maintenance of these standards. Your fire safety management plan describes the arrangements for an effective fire safety strategy for preventing the fire from occurring again. With a fire safety management plan, you can protect your property and its occupants in case a fire happens.
                                                There are five components of the Fire Safety Management plan, i.e:

                                                The Fire Warden
                                                A Fire Warden is a professional designated by the management to enforce fire safety arrangements in the workplace. They have the responsibility for workplace activities. They assist managers in implementing the necessary procedures and instructions (as directed by the Safety committee or any other body) to avoid a fire from threatening the health and safety of occupants and any other person in the vicinity.
                                                What is a Fire Warden?
                                                Fire wardens are trained employees who also provide their assistance during an evacuation. In a workplace, a fire warden has to assist the workplace manager with implementing fire safety practices. The fire warden is also responsible for preventing a fire from becoming endangered to the health and safety of the employees and occupants of the building.
                                                Fire wardens are one of the most important links in the life-saving chain, and they have a lot of duties to perform during an emergency situation. Some of these are:
                                                    Gathering people and directing them to their designated rallying points
                                                    Counting the number of people
                                                    Providing assistance to the EMTs and first-aid providers
                                                    Raise awareness about fire hazards

                                                Reactive Duties 
                                                The proactive duty of the fire warden is to prevent a fire from happening in the first place. They do it by mitigating any fire hazards present on the site.
                                                    A fire warden may also have to use fire alarms and fire extinguishers, assist disabled personnel, ensure isolation of hazardous materials, and coordinate in roll call.
                                                    They may also be required to perform emergency management planning by collaborating with the chief warden and the building manager. They also have to ensure that their equipment is up-to-date to respond to an emergency at any given time quickly.
                                                Important Skills Required to be a Fire Warden
                                                These are a few of the important skills which every fire warden should have:

                                                Firefighters' Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
                                                A firefighter's equipment is very extensive, and comprising of various parts and components. A brief list of this equipment is given as follows:
                                                    Fire extinguishers that can either contain water, dry powder, carbon dioxide, foam, and other substances
                                                    Gear: The firefighter's kit consists of a fire-resistant outer suit, inner lining suit, communication system, inner and outer gloves, fire-resistant shoes and woolen socks, and helmet

                                                The Fire Safety Guide
                                                Americans have faced more than a million fires and $15 billion worth of damages due to fires in 2019 alone. In many of these cases, lack of fire safety training was one of the major causes due to which people were not able to save themselves. Therefore, being aware of fighting with dangerous flames is an essential thing for you to know so that you can save your life as well as rescue others from these types of hazardous situations.
                                                Preventing House Fires
                                                The most common cause of fire incidents in households is unattended cooking. You can take these steps to reduce the likelihood of these incidents:
                                                    Try installing smoke alarms that must work during the day as well as during the night (since most of the fire incidents happen during the night when people are fast asleep)
                                                    Ensure that you never leave your kitchen while cooking food, especially while using deep fryers
                                                    Do not use portable or fixed space heaters because fires from heating equipment are the second-leading cause of fire-related deaths
                                                    Make a fire plan that allows you to escape your home within 2 minutes, and try practicing it as much as possible
                                                    Try not to
                                                    reventing House Fires
                                                    Ensuring the Safety of Electrical Equipment
                                                    The best way to prevent electricity-related fire incidents in households is to hire a qualified electrician to change your house's wiring. You should also keep an eye on the electrical cords and ensure that they do not run under the carpets or across the doorways, as they can get damaged in these places, and you would not get notified. You should also limit the number of electrical plugs in your electrical outlet. Overloading of these outlets can trip a breaker and start a fire. Also, the light bulbs in your house should match the recommended wattage designated for each bulb.
                                                    Other Necessary Precautions for Avoiding Short Circuit
                                                        Replacing damaged extension cords with the proper ones can help prevent fire hazards in your house. Instead of fixing the damaged cords, replace them with an upgraded version
                                                        Another necessary precaution you must take regarding your electrical equipment and appliances is keeping them away from water. Many appliances, such as juicers, water dispensers, and grinders, are commonly used near water. Therefore, it is best to stay alert while using these appliances
                                                         All of your outlets near the water source must be GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters) receptacles. These GFCI receptacles can quickly shut off the power if they sense an evident short circuit
                                                    smoke in your house
                                                Testing a Smoke Detector
                                                Smoke alarm malfunctioning is a leading cause of fire-related incidents. According to National Fire Protection Association, three out of every five fire-related house deaths are due to non-functioning smoke alarms. If you have smoke alarms installed in your home, you should check them monthly by pushing the test button.

                                                Appropriate Places for Installing Smoke Alarms
                                                Installation of smoke alarms is recommended on all the floors, including the basement as well as all the sleeping rooms. It is appropriate not to install smoke alarms on the ceiling. Instead, they should be placed high on a wall not more than a foot from a ceiling.

                                                Installing Smoke Alarms in the Basement
                                                To avoid any false alarms, you should place your smoke alarms in the kitchen in such a way that they are at least ten feet away from any cooki
                                                Fire Safety Training for Employees
                                                The fire safety training for employees should enable them to prevent fires by following the correct procedure. They should also be able to stay safe and escape quickly from the burning premises. To ensure that their employees' fire training is up to the mark, businesses and offices should give them regular training sessions.
                                                Further in this topic, the information regarding fire safety training of employees, employers, and the people in control of the premises is given in the light of Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order, 2005 issued by the government of the U.K. 
                                                Reasons Why Fire Safety Training is Important for Employees
                                                    It helps employees recognize the fire hazards
                                                    Employees can prevent fires from happening in the first place
                                                    Employees that are trained to cope with fires know how to respond adequately in case of an accident
                                                Instructions for Employees Regarding Fire Training
                                                    Your employer is bound to provide you with adequate fire safety measures on your work premises
                                                    You have the right to receive proper training and instructions about any identified risks on your premises, along with fire safety measures and the necessary actions to be taken in the event of a fire
                                                    You must ensure that your workplace is safe from any harm caused by the fire
                                                    You should avoid taking any action that puts you or your colleagues at risk of fire-related incidents
                                                    It would help if you informed your employer (or any of your colleagues) regarding any potential danger that can cause a severe and immediate fire safety danger
                                                    You should also notify your employer about any shortcomings present in the fire safety system of the premises
                                                    You should cooperate with your employer and allow them to fulfill their fire safety responsibilities
                                                What are Fire Drills?
                                                Fire drills are stimulated exercises that are conducted to help people in practicing safe evacuation in case of a fire. Most cases of fire drills involve activation of the building's fire safety alarm system, and the people are required to leave the premises as if an actual fire had happened.
                                                Aims of a Fire Drill
                                                Some aims of conducting a fire drill in office places are:
                                                    Preparing the building occupants to react promptly and adequately in case of a fire emergency
                                                    Making the occupants familiar with alarm features and systems of the building
                                                    Help the occupants know about the fire extinguisher locations
                                                    Allow them to recognize the emergency  point/rally point

                                                    What to Do Once the Fire Has Started?
                                                        Try extinguishing the fire with an extinguisher if you know how to operate it
                                                        Try to GET OUT towards the emergency assembly area. STAY OUT, and call the local emergency services
                                                        If you find yourself trapped behind the doors and they feel warm upon touch, do not try to open them. Similarly, if the doorknobs or handles feel warm to touch, do not try to open them
                                                        If the smoke blocks your primary escape route, run towards the alternative one
                                                        If there is no other way around, lower yourself from the smoke and then run towards the escape
                                                        If your exit route is blocked by smoke, heat, or flames, confine yourself to a room and close the doors. Place a wet towel under the cloth and call your local emergency and rescue services
                                                        Remember, never use the elevators to evacuate the premises. Use stairs instead,

                                        Every electric circuit needs a switching and a protective device. Switchgear is the general term covering a wide range of equipment connected with switching and protection. A circuit breaker is a switching device and also used to trip the circuit. 
                                        A circuit breaker serves mainly two purposes:

                                        - Switching the circuit (on and off) during normal operation.
                                        - Switching during abnormal conditions - short circuits, overload conditions to protect the connected equipment/load.
                                        Lesson Summary
                                        In this course, you have learned about the working principle of circuit breakers, their types, and specifications. We showed you how to select an appropriate size of these electrical switches, and we also explained the arc extinction process.
                                        Let's go over some of the main points covered in this course:

                                            A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electromechanical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by an overload or a short-circuit. 
                                            Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can reset to resume normal operation.
                                            A miniature circuit breaker (MCB) is an automatic electro-mechanical switch, used to protect an electric circuit under abnormal conditions.
                                            The types of circuit breakers are miniature circuit breakers (MCB), moulded case circuit breakers (MCCB), air blast circuit breakers (ACB) and vacuum circuit breaker (VCB).
                                            An arc is produced in every circuit breaker, and unless carefully controlled, the arc can lead to the danger of fire or explosion. Two methods commonly used for arc extinction are high and low resistance interruption.

                                        Lesson Summary
                                        In this module, you learned:
                                        Sensors Performance Terminologies
                                        Sensors are elements that produce a signal relating to the quantity being measured. Transducers are elements that, when subjected to some physical change, experience a related change. Sensors are also transducers.
                                        Some of the key terminologies used for sensors are:

                                            Sensitivity: The relationship indicating how much output one gets per unit input.
                                            Resolution: The slightest change in input value will produce a noticeable shift in output values.
                                            Static characteristics: They are values that are given when a steady-state condition occurs.
                                            Dynamic characteristics: The behaviour between the time that the input values change, and the time the values given by transducers settle down.
                                            Response time: The time which elapses after a constant input is applied up to the point at which a transducer gives values corresponding to some specific % of the output value. 
                                            Rise time: The time taken for the output to rise to some specific % of the steady-state output.
                                            Settling time: The time taken for the output to settle to within some % of steady-state value.

                                        Displacement, Position, and Proximity Sensors
                                        Some of the factors to consider when selecting a suitable sensor to measure a desired physical parameter are: 

                                            Range and Resolution

                                            Accuracy and Sensitivity

                                            Resonance and Linearity
                                            Response time and Operating temperature

                                            Precision and Dead band

                                            Bandwidth and Signal-to-noise ratio

                                        The sensors used in measuring displacement are: 
                                        Potentiometer  |  Strain gauge  |  Linear Variable Differential Transformer  |  Encoders
                                        Switches can serve as proximity sensors. For example, limit switches can be used to indicate the displacement limit of an object. 


                                        Hall effect sensors can be used to measure displacement, position, and proximity. The two types of hall effect sensors are Linear and threshold hall effect sensors. 
                                        Force and Fluid Flow Sensors

                                        Spring balance is an example of the force sensor. It essentially measures displacement, which is then calibrated in terms of force.
                                        Examples of pressure sensors are: piezoelectric sensors and tactile sensors.
                                        The method of measuring a liquid flow is based on measuring the pressure drop occurring when the fluid flows through a constriction.
                                        Example of temperature sensors are: 
                                        Bimetallic strips  |  Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD)  |  Thermistors  |  Thermodiodes  |  Thermotransistor.

                                        Acceleration & Vibration Measurement Sensors

                                        An accelerometer is a sensor designed to measure acceleration or rate of change of speed due to motion, vibration, and impact events.

                                        The design of an accelerometer is based on the inertia effect associated with a mass connected to a moving object through a spring, damper and displacement sensor.

                                        While the intention of an accelerometer is to measure the acceleration of an object, that of a vibrometer is to measure the displacement of an object. 

                                        Microelectromechanical (MEM) devices are a new class of semiconductor sensors and actuators. In 1980, the first MEM sensor was developed using IC technology to etch silicon and produce a device that responds to acceleration.

                                            Distinguish between hydraulic and pneumatic actuators.

                                        Lesson Summary
                                        In this module, you learned:
                                        Mechanical Actuation Systems
                                        Actuation mechanisms are devices that convert one form of motion to another. Examples are linkages, cams, gears, rack & pinion, chain and belt drives.

                                        The design of most mechanical actuation mechanisms is based on two primary forms of kinematic chains: Four-bar chain and slider-crank chain.

                                        In mechatronics, gears are used to reduce speed and increase the torque of mechanical components such as a motor. Also, bearings are to guide mechanical components with minimum friction.

                                        Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators
                                        An actuator is an element of a control system responsible for transforming the output of a microprocessor or control system into a controlling action in a machine or device.

                                        In pneumatic actuators, the working fluid is compressed air, and
                                        The major components of hydraulic and pneumatic actuating systems are:

                                            Power supply and Cylinders
                                            Directional control valves

                                            Process control valves
                                            Pressure control valves

                                        Electrical Actuation System
                                        Relays are examples of electromagnetic switches used to turn on or off a circuit by a low power signal.
                                        Solenoids consist of a coil of electrical wire with an armature attracted to the coil when a current passes through it. When the current through the coil ceases, the armature returns to its original position.

                                        In a conventional DC motor, wire coils are mounted in slots on a cylinder of magnetic material called an armature. The armature is mounted in the magnetic field produced by field poles. The ends of each armature coils are connected to a commutator via carbon brushes. As the armature rotates, the commutator reverses the current in each coil as it moves between the field poles.

                                        The three classifications of DC motors with field coils are:

                                            Series-wound and shunt-wound DC motors
                                            Compound-wound DC motor

                                        in hydraulic actuators, the working fluid is usually oil
                                        The speed of a permanent magnet DC motor depends on the current through the armature coil. However, for a field coil motor, the speed of the motor can be changed by either varying the armature current or the field current.
                                        In AC motors, the rotor receives power by induction, in contrast to DC motors which receive power by conduction.

                                        Synchronous motors are similar to induction motors except that they have a rotor, a permanent magnet. As the magnetic field of the stator rotates, the magnetic rotor rotates with it.

                                        Stepper motors are special types of DC motors. It can rotate in both directions, move in precise angular increment, sustain a holding torque at zero speed, and be controlled with digital circuits.

                                        Data Presentation Systems

                                        Two classifications of data representation are Indicators and recorders.

                                        Some printers are the dot matrix printer, ink/bubble jet printer, and laser printer.

                                        Many display systems use light indicators to indicate on/off status or give alphanumeric displays.
                                        The light indicators used in display systems are neon lamps, Light Emitting Diode (LED), and Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD).

                                        Introduction to Signal Conditioning
                                        Some of the reasons for needing signal conditioning in mechatronics systems are:

                                            The signal from sensors may be too small to be amplified.
                                            The signal from the sensor contains interference which has to be removed.
                                            Digital signal need to be made analogue or vice versa.

                                        An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a high gain DC voltage amplifier with a differential input and a single-ended output. 
                                        An op-amp usually has feedback from the output to the inverting input. This feedback results in the stabilisation of the amplifier and helps in the control of the gain. 
                                        Most amplifiers are designed to have a large input impedance so that minimal current is drawn from the input.

                                        Ideal op-amp exhibits infinite bandwidth while real op-amp exhibits finite bandwidth.

                                        Lesson Summary
                                        An action potential is the firing of electrical signals from one neuron to another caused by a brief change in the voltage across the cell membrane.  This is due to the flow of certain ions into and out of the neuron.  This Module uses potassium+ (K+) and sodium+(Na+) in most of the models that explain this mechanism. 
                                        Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley discovered a Nerve Impulse Flow from a giant squid axon in 1952. They developed a theorem called The Hodgkin-Huxley Model or Conductance-Based Model, a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons.

                                        Psychological Theories of Intelligence:


                                            Two-Factor Theory: Intelligence is divided into General Intelligence (g-factor) and Specific Intelligence (s-factor). The g-factor is the sum of s-factors scores. 
                                             Thurstone‚Äôs Modified g-factor Intelligence Theory: Instead of viewing intelligence as a single general ability, this theory focused on seven different primary mental abilities. 
                                            Howard Gardener‚Äôs Multiple Intelligence Theory: This theory proposed eight different types of intelligence based on skills and abilities that are valued in different cultures.
                                            Robert Sternberg‚Äôs Triarchic Theory of Intelligence: Defines intelligence as "mental activity directed towards purposive adaptation, selection and shaping of real-world environments relevant to one‚Äôs life".

                                        Robotics is a relatively new science, going back to fourteen or fifteen century. For some people, Robotics is a hobby. For others, it is a science fiction genre. For some, it is an engineering discipline or industrial technology. Robotics is also a controversial subject, often misrepresented in popular media.

                                        No single definition can satisfy such a variety of perspectives and interests as those of Robotics. Robotics is the intelligence connection of perception to action
                                        The history of robotics started with Leonardo da Vinci who, in 1495, designed a mechanical device that looked like an armoured knight. In 1920, the Czechoslovakian playwright Karel Capec introduced the word ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù in the play ‚ÄúRossum‚Äôs Universal Robots‚Äù. The word came from the Czech ‚ÄúRobota‚Äù, meaning ‚Äútedious labour‚Äù.
                                        According to Issac Asimov, three fundamental laws regulates Robotics:

                                            First Law: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
                                            Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

                                            Lesson Summary
                                            In general, degrees of freedom (DOF) are the set of independent displacements that specify completely the displaced or deformed position of the body or system.
                                            In robotics, degrees of freedom is often used to describe the number of directions that a robot can move a joint. A robot that has mechanisms to control all the six physical degrees of freedom is said to be holonomic. An object with fewer controllable degrees of freedom than the total degrees of freedom are said to be non-holonomic and an object with more controllable degrees of freedom than the total degrees of freedom is said to be redundant.
                                            A manipulator consists of joints and links. Joints provide relative motion. Links are rigid members between joints. There are various joint types, linear and rotary. Each joint provide a ‚Äúdegree of freedom‚Äù. Most robots possess five or six degrees of freedom
                                            A robot manipulator consists of two sections:
                                                Body and arm ‚Äì for positioning of objects in the robot‚Äôs work volume
                                                Wrist assembly ‚Äì for the orientation of objects

                                            Lesson Summary
                                            The relative position and orientation of the axes of two successive joints can be specified by two link parameters, link length and link twist angle.
                                            The two link parameters are always constant and are specified as part of the mechanical design.
                                            The orientation of a tool can be represented in Joint Coordinates by YPR (Yaw, Pitch and Roll) convention. In rectangular or Cartesian coordinates, the same can be represented by a rotation matrix R, where the three columns of R correspond to the normal, sliding and approach vectors respectively.
                                            The approach vector is aligned with the roll axis and points away from the wrist. Consequently, it represents the direction in which the tool is pointing.
                                            The sliding vector is orthogonal to the approach vector and aligned with the open-close axis of the tool.
                                            Yaw, Pich and Roll motions are rotations about normal, sliding and approach vectors.
                                            To manipulate objects in space, it is required to control both the position and orientation of the tool/end effector in three-dimensional space.

                                                Robot path planning problem is formulated in tool-configuration space, and robot motion is controlled at the joint space
                                                For the calculation of the Jacobian, we need to

                                                One of the potential problems with solving for joint space velocity is the non-existence of inverse. The Jacobean may not be invertible for all the values of Œ∏
                                                At certain points in joint space, Jacobian loses its rank; i.e. there is a reduction in the number of independent rows and columns. The points at which the Jacobian loses rank are called Joint spaces singularities.
                                                It is worthy of note that the Jacobian matrix J(q) is of full rank as long as q is not a joint space singularity.

                                            Electro-Motive Force (EMF) is a characteristic of an energy source capable of driving electric charge around a circuit while the electric current is the flow of electrons. 
                                            Voltage is the electromotive force or electric tension while Potential difference is a measure of the stored energy of any form.
                                            Formula charts serve as a quick guide and resource for relating resistance, current, voltage, and power.
                                            Resistance is the property of a material to resist (oppose) the flow of current. The unit of resistance is the ohm. A conductor is said to have a resistance of one ohm if it permits one ampere current to flow through it when one volt is impressed across its terminals.

                                            Capacitance = Charge / Voltage Farads (i.e. C = Q / V Farads).
                                            Resistors are classified into Conductors, Semiconductors, and Insulators.
                                            Independent voltage source supply and maintain the same voltage across its terminals immaterial of the current flowing through it. A dependent voltage source provides a voltage supply whose magnitude depends on either the voltage across or current flowing through some other circuit element.
                                            The capacitor is an element which stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field. It is denoted as "C" and it is measured in Farads (F). The capacitor is a passive component consisting of a pair of conductors separated by a dielectric.
                                            A Voltage Source is a device that generates an exact output voltage which, in theory, does not change immaterial of the load current.
                                            The elements which are capable of delivering energy is called active elements. The elements which are not capable of delivering energy is called passive elements.
                                            Resistance is the property of any substance due to which it resists (opposes) the flow of current in it. The unit of resistance is the ohm. A conductor is said to have a resistance of one ohm if it permits one ampere current to flow through it when one volt is impressed across its terminals.
                                            The Wheatstone Bridge is one of the methods of measuring the value of unknown resistance.

                                        Lesson Summary

                                            Machining is a process of removing the material from a workpiece to create a part of desired shape, size and surface finish.
                                            In traditional machining, the toot makes physical contact with the workpr and produces contact stresses, which cause the fracture on the surface of the workpiece.
                                            In the chemical processes, chemical reactions take place on the surface of thecause the removal of the material.
                                            Electrochemical machining process is governed by the Faraday‚Äôs laws of electrochemistry.
                                            Thermal-based machining processes remove the material by melting and/or vaporization.
                                            In advanced manufacturing processes, the local stresses are produced in a providing different types of material removal processes.
                                            In conventional machining, stresses are produced by a wedge shaped tool, contact stresses in the workpiece.
                                            Typical abrasive particles are cubic boron nitride.

                                        Lesson Summary

                                            Grinding is required after machining to improve accuracy.
                                            The grinding becomes unavoidable for the component which are difficult to machine for excessive strength and
                                            hardened after machining for dimensional stability and wear resistance.
                                            Some engineering components require super-finish for both dimensional accuracy for their expected and desired performance.
                                            The material removal rate in super finishing is small as compared to the grinding process.
                                            The surface finish requirement may be as important as the desired dimensional accuracy.
                                            Roughness produced by a machining operation is the combined effect of two independent quantities.
                                            CNC means Computer Numerical Control.
                                            Numerical control machining is a class of machining in tool industry, where numerical control enables an operator to communicate with the machine tools through numerically encoded instructions.
                                            Computer numerical control machining means, machining system where the machine tools functions are controlled by computer encoded instructions.
                                            CNC machines can produce parts with great speed, accuracy and repeatability.

                                            The key points from this module are:
                                            Plastic Filament
                                            The plastic raw material used in 3D printing is widely available and is not expensive.
                                            PLA stands for Poly-Lactic Acid ‚Äì It is biodegradable.
                                            When 3D printing the plastic filament must be heated by the printer before it is extruded onto the printer build plate.

                                            The heated plastic filament emerges from the extruder nozzle of the printer.

                                            There are 3 axes on a 3D printer:
                                            ‚Ä¢ X axis
                                            ‚Ä¢ Y axis
                                            ‚Ä¢ Z axis
                                            When 3D printing it is critical that the printed object stays attached to the printer's base to avoid defects in the printed object.
                                            Oil can be used to coat the plastic filament and helps it move smoothly through the extruder nozzle of the 3D printer

                                                All transactions should be recorded in money terms.

                                                Understanding and using accounting information
                                                An understanding of the accounting system is an important first step in this topic.
                                                Basically this topic is about Output. The data (input) has been collected and sorted into records from which reports have been prepared (process) and now it is up to you to use that information to make decisions (output).
                                                There are several steps in using output:
                                                Analysis and interpretation
                                                Evaluation
                                                Decision Making

                                                directing attention to the significance of various figures and relationships. 

                                                For instance this could involve comparing this year's sales revenue with the previous year's.

                                            Key ratios - profitability
                                            The key ratios used in the previous course are repeated here. Several ratios have been added and are indicated by an asterisk.
                                            Profitability is the measure of profit against sales, assets, capital or other figures.
                                            Ratio	Formula	Explanation
                                            Profitability	 	 
                                            1. Return on assets	
                                            	
                                            *Return on owner's investment (ROI)	Net profit/average owners equity	This ratio shows the return to the owner on funds invested in the business. Allowing for the extent of funds borrowed this ratio may differ from return on assets.
                                            Return on assets (ROA)	Net profit/average total asset NP/TA	This ratio reflects the return on the total assets used in the business. The average of total assets at the beginning of the period and at the end is used in case there is a significant change in assets.
                                            2. Return on sales	
                                            Key ratios - liquidity
                                            Liquidity is the ability of the firm to meet its short term debts.
                                            Ratio	Formula	Explanation
                                            Liquidity	 	 
                                            1. Working capital ratio	Current assets/current liabilities	The working capital ratio attempts to measure the ability of the business to meet short term obligations. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. It is difficult to define what is an adequate working capital. Too high a working capital indicates ineffective use of funds whilst insufficient working capital means difficulty meeting obligations.
                                            2. Quick asset ratio	Current assets less stock and prepaid expenses/current liabilities less bank overdraft	This ratio is a more urgent measure of liquidity. It does not include items that are not so quickly converted to cash. The bank overdraft has been regarded as an obligation not immediately called for. Some definitions, however, no longer regard this as always being true so do not deduct from

                                            	
                                            Key ratios - efficiency
                                            Efficiency it the ability of the firm to maximize their stock
                                            Ratio	Formula	Explanation
                                            Efficiency	
                                            	
                                            1. Debtors turnover	Credit sales/average debtors	This ratio may be measured in 'times per annum' or in days. It shows how quickly the money is returned to the business when goods are sold on credit. To evaluate the effectiveness of this ratio it has to be compared to the credit terms offered to debtors.
                                            2. Stock turnover	Cost of sales/average inventory	Measures how quickly stock (inventory) is sold on average. Like debtors turnover it may be measured in 'times per annum' or in days
                                            3. Creditors turnover	Credit purchases/average creditors	This measures the average time taken to pay creditors. When compared to the credit terms offered by creditors it may indicate if the business is taking advantage of discounts.
                                            Key ratios - stability
                                            Stability is the long term prospects of the business surviving.
                                            Ratio	Formula	Explanation
                                            Stability	 	 
                                            *Interest coverage ratio	Net cash inflow from operations + interest/interest expense	This ratio reflects the ability of a firm to meet the interest requirements on borrowed funds. Some texts define this ratio as Net profit + interest/interest expense.
                                            Gearing - Debt ratio
                                            The cash cycle
                                            The cash cycle measures the time it takes to buy and sell stock, collect money from debtors and return that money to the business. To complete the measurement the time allowed by creditors to pay is deducted.

                                            For instance, if stock turnover is 65 days and debtors turnover is 40 days this adds to 105 days. If creditors turnover is 30 days then the cash cycle is said to be 75 days.

                                            Benchmarks
                                            This may be a target internally determined by a business or an industry benchmark gained by the collection of data from a number of similar firms.
                                            Benchmarks are also known as yardsticks. They may be based on comparisons and so may include comparisons with:

                                                previous reports
                                                budgeted reports
                                                industry averages
                                                reports of similar firms
                                                opportunity cost - the value of the next best alternative

                                            Presentation
                                            It is recommended that you use graphs to improve presentation and understanding of information. This presentation may be assisted by computer programs. They may be interspersed between paragraphs as they become relevant to the particular accounting task. There is no doubt graphs add to the report and help the explanation. I would further recommend the use of graphs when carrying out trend analysis. The plotting of a series of graphs over several years for each of the profitability measures may more clearly show changes in profitability.
                                            The problem with using graphs is that you will often rely on the graph alone. While this does identify the change which has taken place it does not necessarily show the amount involved. To fully satisfy the particular criteria you may have to explain why the change has taken place.
                                            The use of horizontal and vertical variance analysis is encouraged. Like graphs they tend to focus your response, however, they share the common problem with graphs, of identifying but not explaining.

                                            It is very important that you support graphs with an explanation. You are invariably required to give 'reasons for the change'. It is also important to note that 'the reasons must be relevant to the hypothetical business'. Reasons will be found in the data and in the preamble provided by the
                                            .../cont.
                                            The Profit and Loss statement may be broken up to show both a vertical and horizontal analysis. For instance, the revenue section may be presented as follows:
                                            Figure 18
                                            This process may be repeated for the entire Profit and Loss statement.
                                            Figure 19
                                            Legend ‚ú¥NP/OE = Net profit to owner's equity ROI  ‚ú¥ GP/sales = Gross profit to sales  ‚ú¥ NP/sales = Net profit to sales
                                            It is important to note that the percentage change is not arrived at by direct deduction alone. For NP/owner's equity the percentage in 2000 is 80.2% and in 2001,40.9%. Many students then deduct 40.9% from 80.2% and say that this ratio has decreased by 39.3%. However, the 39.3% must then be divided by 80.2% to find the actual percent change..
                                            .../cont.
                                            Having completed the table above, you should then show this data in a line graph for each profitability measure
                                            Suppose the issue is liquidity. Once again Table 1 would be repeated, this time selecting ratios relevant to liquidity.
                                            These figures can then be converted into line graphs. Remember to correctly label all graphs.
                                            The ratios to select include:


                                                working capital
                                                quick asset ratio
                                                creditors turnover
                                                debtors turnover
                                                stock turnover
                                                bank balance

                                            Relevant reasons have to be given for changes to liquidity.

                                            Reasons for deterioration of liquidity include:


                                                deterioration in cash cycle such as slow paying debtors, slow moving stock items
                                                buying of non-current assets for cash
                                                excessive cash drawings

                                            How changes to numerators and denominators impact on the ratio
                                            Each of the ratios stated previously has a numerator and a denominator. For example: Net profit/(average) Total assets. The net profit is the numerator and the total assets the denominator. The ratio will be improved by increasing net profit at a faster rate than total assets or decreasing net profit at a slower rate.
                                            When considering a change in a ratio you should:

                                                measure the ratio
                                                show how it was calculated
                                                explain the changes to the numerator and denominator that caused the ratio to change

                                            May be increased by (for decreases reverse the increase/decrease below)
                                            an increase in sales
                                            a decrease in price, which may stimulate extra demand
                                            an improved location
                                            increased spending on advertising and sales wages
                                            Ratios
                                            Liquidity ratios: Working capital (current assets/current liabilities)
                                            There is an optimum amount for working capital and it may be too high or too low. A working capital (WC) that is too high means an inefficient use of funds, reflected by excessive stock, debtors or cash. It may also indicate an inability to obtain stock on credit.
                                            A WC that is too low means the inability to take advantage of credit terms offered with the loss of discount. Businesses are engaged in 'hand to mouth' buying and may be forced to rely on bank overdrafts and other credit, which is expensive.
                                            This ratio is easily manipulated. For instance, borrowing long term to repay short term debts will improve the ratio without being of benefit to the business.
                                            Quick asset ratio: (current assets less stock and prepaid expenses/current liabilities less bank overdraft).
                                            There is not the same certainty these days that the bank overdraft will not be immediately called in, some businesses do not deduct bank overdraft from current liabilities when calculating this ratio. Thi

                                            Debtors turnover: (credit sales/average debtors)


                                                credit sales
                                                extension of credit terms offered to potential credit customers
                                                offering of credit to a greater range of potential customers
                                                debtors

                                            The reduction of average debtors will also improve this ratio:


                                                discount offered to debtors
                                                reduction in credit offered
                                                incentives to buy for cash

                                            Stock turnover: (cost of goods sold/average inventory)


                                            The cost of sales will improve with greater sales. This is favourable to the business. On the other hand a business may face an increase in cost of sales, with increased unit costs and be unable to increase selling price accordingly. This would be unfavourable to the business.

                                            Trend analysis
                                            It is important to recognise trends or patterns relating to particular businesses. These trends may relate to sales, margins, expenses or profit. All of these items may be measured in amount or as a percentage of some other relevant figure. When measured over more than one period it may show trends or movements in these figures. Business may then act by making decisions relating to those statistics.




                                            ecline in profit
                                            The reasons for a decline in profit may include:


                                                excessive stock loss
                                                increased competition
                                                loss of traditional customers
                                                increase in expenses without a commensurate increase in sales

                                            There are numerous other possible reasons, however, they must 'fit the scenario'.
                                            Example of Losses
                                            For example, let us select the profit to sales ratio. In a hypothetical example, net profit to sales may fall in the budgeted year.

                                            This may be due to a fall in profit or a rise in sales and reasons may include:


                                                an increase in the unit cost of items sold

                                            Creditors turnover: (Credit purchases/average creditors)
                                            The terms offered by creditors must be noted when measuring the success of a business in dealing with this ratio. If creditors offer 30 days and the ratio is below 30 days this would indicate that the business is taking advantage of discounts and maintaining a happy relationship with creditors.

                                            By taking longer to pay than the terms offered means that the business is:


                                                jeopardising future supplies
                                                influencing the quality of service, such as being informed about new products and so on
                                                reducing discounts received

                                            Discussing long term stability
                                            Selection of the key ratios is again important. It is easy to use a multitude of 'gearing' ratios, however, only one is necessary. Most people favour liabilities to total assets as a measure of gearing.
                                            The references are not consistent in their definition of ratio items. For instance, some define the rate of return ratio using "owner's equity" whilst others use 'average owner's equity'. Either is acceptable providing you are consistent in the application of these measures. Where relevant you should use an 'average' figure.
                                            Two other possible ratios to use are:
                                            debt ratio = Interest bearing debt/total assets


                                            interest coverage ratio = Net cash flow from operations + interest/interest expense
                                            It is important that you graph the ratios stated above along with liabilities: total assets. The movement of these ratios must be explained and, if provided, compared with a benchmark.
                                            By referring to the financial reports you should attempt to explain why changes have occurred.
                                            Before condemning a business in respect of it's long term stability check the nature of the non-current assets. If these assets have been acquired some time ago and are shown at historical cost then it may be possible that they are considerably understated in value, which means the gearing situation is not as bad as it appears.
                                            .../cont.
                                            On the other hand a business, which has a reasonable gearing, may still fail if it loses a major account or suffers the failure of a major customer/debtor.

                                            An area you may wish to pursue in your report concerns items which are certainly not measurable but vital in performance evaluation. One such example is the quality of the management of the business you are evaluating.
                                            The advice you provide to management may be non-financial such as providing better staff training, improved customer relations and use of the internet. You may also suggest that the business widen or contract operations.
                                            Limitations in the use of accounting information
                                            Problems in using historical information:


                                                the nature of the business may have changed
                                                the historical information may have been obtained from unreliable data
                                                the business may be in an industry which is changing
                                                the data may not reflect the state of the economy, either specific to this industry or in general
                                                the quality of leadership may not be shown
                                                not all information may be available; for example, the intention to introduce new technology
                                                The qualities of good information include:

                                            The qualities of good information include:


                                                comparability
                                                relevance

                                            Balance day adjustments
                                            When using the 'Asset' approach to expense recognition the initial payment is treated as an asset rather than an expense. A consequence of this approach is that there are no reversing entries involved as only that portion of the payment to be treated as an expense is deducted from the 'asset'.
                                            Example
                                            Stan Jones from the Video and CD Store pays $6000, on 1 January for an advertising program which will extend over the next three years.

                                            The cash budget
                                            The cash budget is a report designed to show future movements of cash into and out of a business. The purpose of a cash budget is to plan and control future cash movements.

                                            The cash budget may indicate shortages of cash, in which case the business may:


                                                arrange additional finance
                                                postpone intended spending on non-current assets
                                                delay payment of outstanding debts

                                                revenue but not a receipt

                                                an expense but not a payment

                                            Reasons for having shorter budget periods include:


                                                to provide more accurate information in the budget for the business to act on
                                                to better identify periods of cash shortage leading to decisions to improve cash flow
                                                to better identify cash surplus maximising the return on excess funds

                                                Relates to budgeting in that it is a process designed to enable a business to more accurately predict receipt of funds from individual debtors.
                                                A typical ageing analysis may be shown as:
                                                Figure 31
                                                Figure 31
                                                Comments may also be made as to the best strategy to recover these outstanding debts.
                                                It is important to know what the credit policy of the business is, before commenting on the performance of the business in collecting of outstanding debts. In this case if 30 days is given for payment then performance is poor, as only 44% have been collected in that time. Should it be 60 days then performance is much better with 80% collected (44% + 36%).
                                                It is very important to watch the pattern emerging in the collection of debts and be wary of any deterioration

                                            Information debtors (accounts receivable) ageing analysis provides


                                                it shows for how long each individual accounts receivable has owed money to the business
                                                individual accounts receivable may be matched against the terms offered to see how they are responding
                                                when matched against discount offered the analysis reveals that accounts receivable (debtors) are eligible for discount
                                                over time the analysis provides a history of each accounts receivable, which may be matched against the cost of carrying and collecting those debts
                                                further analysis into special groups may help decision-making
                                                enables comparison with previous periods to assess performance

                                            Reporting - Profit and Loss statements
                                            Three major accounting reports are:
                                            ‚ñ†    Cash flow statement
                                            ‚ñ†    Profit and Loss statement
                                            ‚ñ†    Balance sheet
                                            When preparing reports the Profit and Loss statement requires both vertical and horizontal classification. The multi column Profit and Loss statement must indicate both gross margin and contribution margin. Make sure that you classify expenses.

                                            Likely errors when compiling reports include the display of aliens such as drawings, loan repayment and petty cash as expenses and the incorrect calculation of depreciation. This takes place when depreciation is shown for one year and the reporting period is only one month.
                                            The Profit and Loss statement may be:

                                                - a trading Profit and Loss statement with functional classification
                                                - a departmental Profit and Loss statement

                                            Control for debtors and creditors
                                            Control accounts are prepared in the general ledger and are used where there are a number of subsidiary items involved in business transactions such as individual debtors, stock or non-current assets and the business desires to group these items into the one ledger account.
                                            What is the purpose of a control account?


                                                the control account is summarised information located in the general ledger. More detailed information is held in the subsidiary ledger
                                                a control account enables a separation of duties between the bookkeeping department (or section) responsible for the general ledger and bookkeeping department (or section) responsible for the subsidiary ledger

                                                The subsidiary ledger is a supplement to the general ledger, continuing specific information about the individual debtors, creditors, stock and other items.
                                                The advantages of preparing a subsidiary ledger are:

                                                    it removes bulky detail from the general ledger. This streamlines posting procedures to the general ledger
                                                    it enables a check to occur between the balance of the control account and the total balances of the individual accounts - usually shown in a schedule
                                                    it allows the separation of duties between the person completing the general ledger and the person dealing with the subsidiary, thus improving security
                                                    it shows the individual transactions involving that particular item. For instance, in the case of debtors, it includes the amount of stock bought on credit, cash received from the debtor and the amount outstanding. The date of which all these individual transactions occurred is also shown
                                                s maintained by checking the balance of the control account with the total of balances shown in the schedule taken from the subsidiary ledger

                                            Likely errors
                                            Questions often concern the posting of data from journals to the general and subsidiary ledger. The task may be focused on the debtors control account and debtors subsidiary ledger. Some errors that students make when completing this task include the following.
                                            Likely errors will include:


                                                entries recorded on the wrong side of the ledger
                                                inability to treat contra entries and bills receivable/payable
                                                failure to include opening balances
                                                omission of sales/purchases returns
                                                inability to treat bad debts
                                                inclusion of items such as cash sales/purchases which do not belong
                                                double counting of discount
                                                recording of entries on an individual basis
                                                failure to total the debtor
                                                Bad debts
                                                Bad debts derive from debtors have been identified by management as being unable to pay outstanding debts. Once management determines that certain debtors are not going to pay the asset debtors is reduced and the expense bad debts is recognised.
                                                In the general journal this would be shown as:
                                                Figure 35
                                                Bad debts will be shown as a financial expense in the Profit and Loss statement.
                                                Bad debts may well be assessed in the context of control accounts or separately. You must be able to separate the treatment of bad debts, firstly when the bad debt occurs in the same period as the credit sale, and secondly, when the bad debt happens in the later period.
                                                Doubtful debts are an estimate of the amount not likely to be recovered from debtors. It is general and not linked to any specific debtor. It is allowed for by a business in order to try to match the expense associated with a revenue (credit sale) in the same reporting period in which the revenue was earned. Doubtful debts are the anticipation of bad debts.

                                                Source documents
                                                Source documents are usually linked to control accounts. Two important documents for students to understand are the invoice and the credit note.
                                                Invoice
                                                An invoice delivered by the seller to the buyer along with the goods as evidence of the transaction. The invoice duplicate is used by the seller (Alex) to record that this has happened in their credit sales journal. The buyer (Stewart Retail Stores) uses the invoice to record the transaction in their credit purchases journal.
                                                For the party selling the goods the effect on the accounting equation is:

                                                    a decrease in the asset stock (show dollar cost)
                                                    an increase in the expense cost of goods sold which is recorded at the cost price, followed by (show $ cost)
                                                    an increase in the asset debtors (show dollar selling)
                                                    an increase in the revenue credit sales, which is recorded at the selling price. (show $ selling)
                                                For the party buying the goods the effect on the accounting equation is:
                                                Credit note
                                                This document is a credit note. The seller delivers the credit note to the buyer following the return of the goods, which in this case have been damaged. The credit note duplicate is used by the seller (Alex) to record that this has happened in their sales returns journal. The buyer (Stewart Retail Stores) uses the credit note original to record the transaction in their purchases returns journal.

                                                In the example for the previous page "Credit note", Alex Fine Furniture would record the sales return by Stewart Retail Furniture as follows:
                                                Figure 36
                                                Credit note accounting equation
                                                For the party returning the goods (Stewart) the effect on the accounting equation is:

                                                    an decrease in the asset stock
                                                    a decrease in the liability creditors
                                                For the party receiving the returned goods (Alex) the effect on the accounting equation is:

                                                    an increase in the asset stock
                                                    a decrease in the asset debtors
                                                These transactions may be recorded in the general journal in the manner stated above.
                                                Reasons for goods being returned include:

                                                    the goods are damaged
                                                    the goods are not in the quantity ordered
                                                    the goods do not match the description

                                            Reporting - historical cash flow statement
                                            Cash flow statements are not to be confused with cash budgets or statements of receipts and payments. The cash flow statement is more than a simple listing of cash receipts and payments.
                                            It classifies cash flow into:
                                            ‚ñ†    operating
                                            ‚ñ†    investing
                                            ‚ñ†    financial
                                            There are two approaches to cash flow statements


                                                Information is presented in the form of a cashbook, cash journals, or a statement of receipts and payments, and you have to classify into the appropriate format
                                                A Profit and Loss statement and a balance sheet with opening and closing balances are provided. After account reconstruction cash amounts are determined and are classified in the cash flow statement.

                                            Cash flow statements report on the movement of cash inward and outward from the business. The cash flow statement is classified into three areas.
                                            Examples of cash flow items
                                            Figure 37
                                            Figure 37
                                            There are three essential skills required in preparing a cash flow statement:


                                                determining whether the item is a cash flow
                                                if yes, classifying that item

                                            Reporting - historical cash flow statement table
                                            It is important to be aware that not all transactions and the resultant accounts belong in the cash flow statement.
                                            In the table below three columns have been prepared.
                                            In the first column are examples of items that belong in the Profit and Loss statement but not in the cash flow statement.
                                            In the second column are items that relate to the same transaction but are reported under different titles and usually different amounts in both the Profit and Loss statement and the cash flow statement.
                                            In the third column are items that belong in the cash flow statement but not in the Profit and Loss statement.

                                            Risk in small business
                                            When evaluating a small business the following twelve (12) points are areas of risk that deserve consideration. Listed here is the first consideration.
                                              1. The form of the business organisation

                                            The manner in which the small business is organised; as a sole trader, a partnership or a company, brings both benefits and disadvantages to the business. The major risk in this situation is that to the personal assets of the owner(s). The concept of 'limited liability' remains a relevant factor to business organisation.
                                              2. Degree of competition




                                              3. The nature of the product

                                            Aspects of stock recording and valuation:


                                                source documents
                                                ledgers

                                            Stock cards may be used as the basis for the preparation of ledger accounts. In the example that follows you are required to prepare a stock card using both FIFO and identified cost. The stock control account will then be prepared from the relevant stock card.

                                            Stock loss/gain is only detected when a physical count of stock occurs and the actual amount is compared with the balance in the stock card. This stock figure should NOT be deducted from 'Cost of goods sold' in the Profit and Loss. The purpose of the stock figure revealed in the physical count is to disclose stock loss/gain and to provide an amount for current assets in the balance sheet.
                                            The treatment of stock loss is not to be confused with stock revaluation following the application of the 'lower of cost and net realisable value' rule. The application of this rule may require a stock write down. The stock write down is an expense and is debited in the general journal whilst stock control, the current asset, is credited. The stock write down

                                            This rule is applied to individual stock items. It is important that students can adequately define each of these terms. Below is an example of an application of that rule.

                                            Reasons for NRV loss may include
                                            Distinguishing between FIFO and identified cost
                                            FIFO ("first in - first out") and identified cost are approaches to measuring the "cost" of stock on hand at the end of the accounting period. The problem occurs when stock is bought in batches during the period at different prices. The business must decide which stock is on hand from which batch.
                                            FIFO method - cost of units removed from inventory is assumed to be from the first units available for sale at the time of each sale.
                                            Identified cost is where the particular batch from which goods are sold is identified. This is relevant when batches of goods are bought at different prices and the identification of actual cost price is considered important. It is possible for items from different batches to be sold in the one transaction. Identification of individual stock items is made possible by electronic measuring devices such as the use of bar codes.

                                                Later more technically advanced models are now available
                                                Later models are cheaper
                                                There has been a fall in demand for modems
                                                Later computers have modems already built-in

                                                Accounting alternatives
                                                Example: In the year ended 31 December smoke detectors are bought in batches:
                                                A stock take revealed that 25 smoke detectors are on hand at 31 December.
                                                The stock was identified as coming from the following batches:
                                                January - 3, May - 10, August - 5 and November 7.


                                                Required
                                                Calculate stock on hand for both FIFO and identified cost.
                                                In their response students should go on to say that FIFO has exceeded the valuation of identified cost for stock by $45. Stating the actual dollar amount is important.
                                                Summary of key learning points for Financial Accounting
                                                Common accounting issues apply to these areas in particular:
                                                    depreciation
                                                    revenue/expense recognition (point of sale or point of cash transfer)
                                                    stock valuation (lower of cost and net realisable value)
                                                    historical cost and non-current asset valuation
                                                The key information and ratios use in accounting include 
                                                    Profitability  - e.g. Return on Investment (ROI)
                                                    Liquidity  - e.g. Working capital ratio
                                                    Efficiency - e.g. Debtors turnover
                                                    Stability - e.g. Gearing - Debt ratio
                                                    The cash cycle
                                                    Trend analysis and bench marking
                                                Balance day adjustments - When using the 'Asset' approach to expense recognition the initial payment is treated as an asset rather than an expense. 

                                                When balance day adjustments are made using the 'expense approach' the payment or receipt is initially treated as an expense or revenue. That portion of the payment, or revenue not used or received, at the end of the accounting period, is then treated as an asset or a liability.

                                                Depreciation is defined as the allocation of the cost of a non-current asset over the economic life of that asset. It is charged at the end of each accounting period. At the end of each accounting period depreciation accumulates and it is the 'Accumulated depreciation' account, which is posted to the Balance sheet as a deduction from the relevant non-current asset.

                                                The cash budget is a report designed to show future movements of cash into and out of a business. The purpose of a cash budget is to plan and control future cash movements.

                                                A variance report shows the difference between actual figures and budgeted figures for a period of time. Variance reports may be applied to any type of financial report. The cash variance report brings together the statement of receipts and payments and the cash budget.

                                                Control accounts are prepared in the general ledger and are used where there are a number of subsidiary items involved in business transactions such as individual debtors, stock or non-current assets and the business desires to group these
                                                Cash flow statements report on the movement of cash inward and outward from the business. The cash flow statement is classified into three areas: Operating, Investing and Financing.
                                                The Profit & Loss Statement is combined the following reports

                                                    Cash flow statement
                                                    Profit and Loss statement
                                                    Balance sheet
                                                When preparing reports the Profit and Loss statement requires both vertical and horizontal classification. The multi column Profit and Loss statement must indicate both gross margin and contribution margin. Make sure that you classify expenses.
                                                Risks for small businesses come from 12 main areas

                                                    The following are the key topics covered in the module:
                                                        Whenever a button on the remote is pressed, it sends an infrared signal to the IR Sensor. The code uses a microcontroller to receive the decoded incoming IR data and use this data to control any device. The IR sensor receives the signal and gives it to our microcontroller.

                                                    Critical Facility: Power Supply Management
                                                    Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:
                                                        Identify and describe Critical Operations.
                                                        Identify critical industries.
                                                    What are Critical Operations?
                                                    Critical Operations are just that‚Äîactions, processes, and systems that enable the execution of the integral functions of a business or organization. Simply put, the litmus test to identify Critical Operations can be: if this "thing"‚Äîa specific task, process, or system‚Äîbroke or stopped working, would this hinder or cripple the continued ability of the organization to meet its goals?
                                                    Critical Operations are classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics. For instance, the emergency generator at an air traffic control tower is absolutely mission critical, whereas a backup generator for your local sporting goods store is not. The consequences of the same component failing are vastly different: the loss of the former during a power outage poses a tremendous, imminent threat to the safe landing of airplanes, but the loss of the latter during a power outage will probably only result in the store closing early and losing some sales. The two are simply not comparable in the severity of their impact.
                                                    There are some systems and processes that are fairly unique to Critical Operations because they create reliability and safety for the systems and processes crucial to the success of the larger entity. Regardless of how commonplace or unique the component may be, Critical Operations are united by the fact they are the fundamental building blocks that allow an organization to deliver a service with little or no possibility for error, downtime, or any other type of interruption.
                                                    Fig. 1.1

                                            Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or service.
                                            Non-physical items such as specific procedures or safety programs might be considered characteristics of the critical infrastructure of critical operations, but in this sense, critical infrastructure focuses on the physical pieces of equipment that make up the critical operations system, including systems networks.
                                            A threat is anything that can potentially cause damage or harm to a person or object. A threat can be environmental in nature, the result of faulty equipment, or human-created in the form of accidents, negligence, or nefarious activities. 
                                            Considering the possible threats posed to the people, property, or systems within a critical facility is an important part of both the design and implementation of critical operations. Within reason, you should always assess the potential threats to critical operations and plan for as many as is practical. This is equally important in design, construction, and day-to-day sustained operations within a facility.
                                            In a critical facility, there is almost never a single piece of equipment‚Äîor even one, stand-alone system‚Äîthat constitutes the whole of the facility‚Äôs critical operations. Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of a system as a set of interconnected "things" or components that come together to form a more complex whole. A fundamental building block of critical operations is simply understanding that these components, in any combination, come together to create a more complicated system that serves a mission critical purpose. 
                                            Within a facility, these various systems work together to perform critical functions and are often connected to each other, via design and/or their operators, by various systems of process and procedure. More often than not, the critical operations within a critical facility include the following systems.

                                            Plumbing and other Mechanical Systems
                                            Safety and Security
                                            Controls
                                            Critical power systems cover an immense spectrum of designs and components, but really only fulfill two purposes: delivering power to equipment performing critical tasks or distribute power from generation sources.


                                            There are five key elements of Critical Operations that tie together the various systems that make up the mission critical environment. These elements include:

                                            Networking and IT
                                            Networking refers to the system of computers and other assorted hardware and software components that are connected together to allow for the communication of data and information between devices. 
                                            It is part of a broader category of Information Technology (IT), which is the broad application of computer devices and other communications equipment that are used to deliver, receive, and store data or other types of information.

                                            Security
                                            Security refers to the application of devices and procedures to ensure that a valuable asset‚Äîwhether an object, a person, a facility, or even information‚Äîis protected from harm. For Critical Operations, security can be grouped into three main areas of focus: protecting people (safety), protecting equipment (physical design), and protecting information (processes and procedures).

                                            Procedures and Policies
                                            Procedures are specifically prescribed means for accomplishing tasks in a reliable and safe manner. Policies are guidelines that direct actions or activities, generally needed to ensure similar outcomes are achieved given a wide array of possible inputs and variables. 
                                            Another way to think of the distinction is that policies govern our thoughts and the boundaries for related actions, while procedures are designed to specific sets or sequences of actions required to assure a predicted result.

                                            Documentation
                                            Documentation is a collection of documents that are relevant to a specific topic, whether that is an object, process, or any other specific subject. Documentation often includes user manuals, procedure checklists, reference guides, and so forth, and can be in hard copy (or paper) or electronic form.
                                             
                                            In a perfect world, documentation should exist‚Äîand be easily accessible‚Äîfor every component of the critical system and for every possible process, policy, or procedure. This includes documents about the system design, installation, and operation specifications, instructions, and material history for all of the various components of the system and facility.

                                            Crises
                                            A crisis is any event or occurrence, typically happening abruptly or with little or no warning, that has the potential to result in an unstable or dangerous environment. 
                                            Crises can take on many forms and require specific responses, depending upon their nature. A natural disaster and the threat of imminent system failure are of equal concern. For the sake of identification and planning, it is important to categorize the different types of crises and how to address them. 

                                                A threat is any natural or man-made occurrence, individual, entity, or action that has or indicates the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.
                                                An incident is any occurrence, caused by either human action or natural phenomena, that may cause harm and that may require action. 
                                                An attack is any malic
                                                Crisis Management
                                                Of all the in-depth planning and design that goes into bringing a critical installation online, and as skilled as its operators may be, emergency situations still arise‚Äîit's inevitable. Hence, the necessity for crisis management: the planning and monitoring for and the immediate response to any potential threat.
                                                It is vital to have well-thought-out crisis management plans that operations teams are trained on and comfortable with. Writing scripts for every possible scenario is highly impractical, if not impossible, but consistent plans to respond to situations, to establish a path towards stability, and to connect the right resources will be invaluable in the event of a crisis. 
                                                Accelerated Decision Time Frame 
                                                With incidents occurring in real time, quick decisions provide windows of opportunity to stop an event or at least mitigate damages from spiraling out of control. Crisis management leaders must think on their feet and be confident enough in prior planning efforts to execute response activities so that they lose as little time as possible. 
                                                ious activity by outside individuals directed at a specific target.

                                            Phases of Crisis Management
                                            In the event of a crisis, there are three phases of crisis management that are typically followed: 

                                                Crisis Assessment - The right problem needs to be addressed and it needs to be fixed. Plans and procedures should be followed to determine things like: How did this begin? Are there other conditions (e.g., alarms, faults, etc.) that we're not seeing? What resources are available? And, what is the status of all our systems? 
                                                Crisis Action Plan - With answers to the preceding questions, the crisis management leader should begin to enact and/or develop action plans. This spans the range from completing triage activities, to incident notification protocols, to marshaling resources for permanent repairs, to establishing the level of sensitivity or urgency under which these actions are to take place. Depending upon the environment, formal crisis response activities may continue on until every single fault or failure is addressed, whereas other facilities simply want to restore operations, even under temporary conditions, and document the go-forward plan. 
                                                Crisis Termination - Again, putting a stop to the crisis response varies by industry and application, but generally falls into the two approaches just mentioned: maintain the crisis response posture until all systems, equipment, and operations are fully restored or repaired, or release this posture once the threat to operational availability has been neutralized and the crisis leadership is comfortable with the documented remediation plans. 

                                            Critical Industries
                                            As a Facilities Operator, it is imperative that you know all of the organizations that are part of the critical infrastructure, especially those that are inherently interconnected.  According to U.S. national policy created to "strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure," there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors. 

                                            Use this policy as a guideline to understand critical infrastructure in whatever nation you may reside in:

                                            Chemical Sector
                                            The Chemical Sector consists of five segments based largely on what final products they produce, each of which has unique characteristics, markets, development opportunities and, accordingly, respective areas of issue. These five segments are: 

                                                Basic chemicals
                                                Speciality chemicals

                                                Consumer products

                                            Commercial Facilities Sector
                                            The Commercial Facilities Sector consists of any facility that operates within the sphere of open public access, which means that the general public can easily enter and move about in the facility's space without the presence of security barriers. Typically, these facilities require unfettered access to the general public because they provide a commercial service or product to them. They fall into one of eight subsectors: 

                                                Public Assembly (such as arenas, stadiums, zoos/aquariums, museums, convention centers, etc.) 
                                                Sports Leagues (such as professional sports leagues or other organizations)
                                                Gaming (such as casinos) 
                                                Lodging (such as hotels, motels, conference centers, etc.) 
                                                Outdoor Events (such as amusement parks, fairs, campgrounds, parades, etc.) 
                                                Entertainment and Media (such as movie theaters, movie studios, broadcast media centers, etc.) 
                                                Real Estate (such as office buildings, apartment buildings, condominiums, mixed-use facilities, storage facilities, etc.) 
                                                Retail (such as retail centers or districts, shopping malls, etc.)

                                            Communications Sector
                                            The Communications Sector is an integral part of the entire critical infrastructure of a nation, since so many other sectors rely heavily upon it. This sector, in particular, has changed significantly over the past two or three decades, as communications technology has quickly evolved: where it used to be primarily concerned with voice services, it now includes terrestrial, satellite, and wireless transmission systems. And, more so, these various transmission types have become interconnected, working together to provide seamless, end-to-end transmissions across different communication media. 

                                            Today, many providers will share their facilities and technologies to ensure that there is interoperability among the different transmission mediums.

                                            Critical Manufacturing Sector
                                            The Critical Manufacturing Sector is another sector that can be considered crucial to the continued, uninterrupted functioning of some of the other critical infrastructure sectors because the products that they manufacture are directly used‚Äîif not essential to‚Äîthe operations of the others. 
                                            This sector consists of four broad categories of industries that manufacture critical components: 

                                                Primary Metal Manufacturing‚Äîincluding iron, steel, and ferro alloy manufacturing, alumina/ aluminum production and processing, and nonferrous metal production and processing. 
                                                Machinery Manufacturing‚Äîincluding engine, turbine, and power transmission equipment manufacturing. 
                                                Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing‚Äîincluding electrical equipment manufacturing. 
                                                Transportation Equipment Manufacturing‚Äîincluding vehicle manufacturing, aviation and aerospace product and parts manufacturing, and railroad rolling stock manufacturing. 

                                            Dams Sector
                                            FIg. 1.7
                                            FIg. 1.7
                                            The Dams Sector is another critical component of a nation's critical infrastructure. The Dams Sector consists of a number of different types of dam-related assets, including dams, locks, levees and dikes, hurricane barriers, hydropower generation facilities, and a host of other water containment or control facilities. The facilities or organizations that fall within the Dams Sector provide services with a wide range of benefits, including water supply and waste management, flood control, waterway navigation, natural wildlife habitats, and even recreation. 
                                            These services also extend to some of the other critical infrastructure sectors‚Äîsuch as providing a source of water for the Food and Agriculture Sector‚Äîcreating strong interdependencies between the Dams Sector and these o
                                            Defense Industrial Base Sector
                                            The Defense Industrial Base Sector is a complex collection of industries that supports the research and development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons, parts, and other components for a nation's military, including products and services that are necessary for mobilizing, deploying, and maintaining military operations.
                                            Financial Services Sector
                                            The Financial Services Sector consists of the wide variety of institutions that provide financial products and services to individual consumers, businesses, and the other critical infrastructure sectors. These activities include depositing funds, making payments between parties, providing credit to consumers, investing funds, and transferring financial risk between parties. 
                                            As technology has become more prevalent in the financial industries, this sector has become more vulnerable to newer security risks including power emergencies, the effects of natural disasters on IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity threats.
                                            ther sector

                                            Emergency Services Sector
                                            The Emergency Services Sector (ESS) serves as a nation's primary defense in regard to the prevention of and remediation of risk resulting from both man-made and natural incidences. In addition to protecting an entire nation in the event of an emergency, it also carries the heavy burden of serving as the first line of defense for the remaining critical infrastructure sectors. 
                                            This includes a wide array of response functions in an emergency, but primarily it is responsible for protecting people, property, and the environment; providing assistance to those affected by the emergency event; and providing recovery services and aid to those impacted by the event. 
                                            These emergency response actions are the responsibility of five broad categories of emergency responders: 

                                                Law enforcement
                                                Public works
                                                Fire and emergency services
                                                Emergency medical services
                                                Emergency management services

                                            Within the ESS, there are also a number of specialized organizations that provide specific services in the event of an emergency of various types, including: 

                                                Public Safety Answering Points (such as emergency telephone call center responders)
                                                Tactical Operations (such as S.W.A.T or Emergency Response Units)
                                                Search and Rescue
                                                Aviation Services (such as police or medical helicopters)
                                                Hazardous Materials
                                                Explosive Ordinance Disposal (such as a bomb 

                                            Energy Sector
                                            The Energy Sector has been labeled "uniquely critical" by DHS because the products and services it provides directly support the critical functioning of the other critical infrastructure sectors. The sector is divided into three interconnected segments, including:

                                                Electricity (which is produced by combusting coal, combusting natural gas, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric plants, or renewable power sources) 
                                                Petroleum 
                                                Natural Gas 

                                            Almost every critical sector relies on some form of energy produced by the Energy Sector industries, making it both incredibly important but also incredibly vulnerable to threats. 
                                            Food and Agriculture Sector
                                            The Food and Agriculture Sector consists of those industries producing and providing food-related products or services to the nation, including:

                                                Farms

                                            Government Facilities Sector
                                            The Government Facilities Sector consists of a number of government-owned and operated buildings, some of which are publicly accessible and some that are open to approved personnel only. Those that are open to the public include buildings used for business, commercial, or even recreational purposes; those that are not open to the public typically house sensitive information or materials, including government-used office buildings, courthouses, embassies, laboratories, or any other structure that might be home to critical equipment or systems. 
                                            The Government Facilities Sector is also responsible for utilizing cyber technology to protect government assets, including information and personnel, that are critical to government functions. 
                                            Healthcare and Public Health Sector
                                            The Healthcare and Public Health Sector is responsible for protecting the public from all sorts of risks to their health, including terrorism, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and other natural disasters. These responsibilities are both proactive, in the form of providing preventative healthcare options; and reactive, in the form of providing healthcare response and recovery actions in an emergency event. 
                                            The healthcare component of these services is typically delivered and managed at the local level via private industries or state-run programs, while the public health component is typically managed across all government levels
                                            Information Technology Sector
                                            The Information Technology Sector has become a key critical sector, as more private citizens, businesses, and other large organizations‚Äîincluding the government‚Äîrely on the availability and stability of computer-related technology. 
                                            The functions of the Information Technology Sector are both virtual and distributed in nature, including the production and distribution of hardware, software, IT systems and services, and (in conjunction with industries in the Communications Sector) the Internet. The threats posed to the Information Technology Sector are vast and ever-changing and require that the private entities involved in IT‚Äîwhich are the private owners and operators that maintain key systems and networks, including the Internet‚Äîwork creatively and collaboratively with the government agencies of the Information Technology Sector to devel
                                            Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector
                                            The Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector oversees a variety of industries or services involved in the general use of nuclear reactors, including:

                                                Nuclear power plants
                                                Non-power nuclear reactors (those used for research, testing, or training)
                                                Manufacturers of nuclear reactors or their components
                                                Nuclear fuel-cycle facilities
                                                Decommissioned nuclear reactors
                                                Entities involved in the transportation, storage, or disposal of nuclear or radioactive waste

                                            Because of the inherent threat that nuclear reactors can pose to the general population (both within a nation and globally), the environment, and the consistent and reliable functioning of many of the other critical sectors, maintaining the safety and security of this sector is of the utmost importance.
                                            op plans to protect the safety and security of the sector's assets
                                            Transportation Systems Sector
                                            The Transportation Systems Sector consists of all of the industries involved in the movement of people or things from one location to another, within the country and to and from overseas locations. There are seven key subsectors within the Transportation Systems Sector: 
                                            Aviation
                                            The Aviation subsector consists of all aircraft, air traffic control systems, commercial airports, and privately owned airports, heliports, and landing strips used in the air travel or transportation of people or things within the nation and traveling to or from international locations. 
                                            Highway Infrastructure and Motor Carrier
                                            Maritime
                                            Mass Transit and Passenger Rail

                                            Water and Wastewater Systems Sector
                                            The Water and Wastewater Systems Sector consists of those facilities and associated systems that provide public drinking water and sewage treatment/wastewater treatment services.
                                            These systems are most vulnerable to attacks that could compromise the availability of potable drinking water, including physical attacks such as contamination with toxic agents or the release of other gaseous chemicals, and cyber attacks that target these systems' functions. Attacks of this nature could result in large-scale health concerns, including illness or death, and the interruption of crucial water services to private citizens, industries, and the other critical infrastructure sectors.

                                            The main points from this module are as follows:

                                                A Critical Operation is classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics.
                                                Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or services.

                                            Critical Infrastructure sectors include:

                                                Identify alternative sources of power. 

                                            Power Fundamentals
                                            When you think of the term "power," you may think first of the utility lines that provide us with the energy needed to keep the lights and your electronic devices powered on and working. And, as you know, power is one of the utilities necessary for keeping Critical Operations up and running. But what you may not know are the fundamental concepts of power: what power is and how it works. 
                                            Electricity
                                            Electricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles. The electricity that is most relevant to the discussion of power and power sources is the latter, known as current electricity since it flows between objects or places. A good analogy for this kind of electricity is water in a hose: when the water is turned on, pressure is applied to the water at one end of the hose and pushes it out the other end. Electricity works similarly: electrically charged particles flow from one end‚Äîsay, a power generator‚Äîand come out on the other end‚Äîperhaps the lights in your house.
                                            But electricity is also a concept that encompasses all aspects about the accumulation or flow of electric charge, from the quality and volume of energy transferred to the manner in which it reacts with different
                                            Critical Systems That Rely on Constant Availability of Power
                                            There are very few purely mechanical systems in use today that do not require some sort of electrical power. It is, therefore, possible to state that all critical systems in Critical Operations rely upon electrical power. The degree, however, to which equipment needs constant availability of power, or a certain quality of power is a differentiating factor. 
                                            Some systems are energy hogs but are not highly sensitive to ebbs and flows in the power supply, while some other systems use only a small amount of electricity but have little or no tolerance for any fluctuation in the quality of power supplied. 
                                            One example of a critical system that relies on the constant availability of power would be a computer-based system, like a data center, in which the components are highly sensitive to a constant supply of electricity at a specific voltage. The concern here is that any interruption, no matter how momentary, can cause a hiccup in the function of a delicate high-speed motor component, which would then cause ripple effects throughout other Critical Operations. Loss of data or continuity of data are both a great concern for all the electronic and digitally controlled systems in place today.

                                            The other form of Critical Operation electrical systems particularly concerned with the constant availability of power are those with complex or extended start-up cycle times. 
                                            Plenty of Critical Operations have sufficient tolerance or backup plans to handle a system going offline for a few seconds or a minute; for instance, an emergency communications/command center could temporarily allow data to be routed elsewhere and rely upon the most recent information or view information from another location to continue making decisions and move operations forward. 
                                            But, bringing all of these systems back online, in the proper sequence and with the proper security considerations in place, might actually take hours or days to complete. In this case, those two seconds of power drop begin to cripple Critical Operations for an extended period of time.

                                            Voltage
                                            Voltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them. 
                                            Volts
                                            A volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity. 
                                            Fig 2.2

                                            Think of it this way: conceptually, it is like both the speed limit of a roadway and the actual speed of the cars traveling on that roadway. The speed limit on Interstate 5 is 70 mph whether or not there are vehicles on the road going 70 mph; in the same manner, a 12V flashlight is still a 12V flashlight whether it is turned on or off. 
                                            Systems are designed to operate at specific voltages, but are not always restricted to that voltage. However, that specific voltage needs to be supplied as consistently as possible to allow the system to operate properly but not running too far outside of optimal operations and potentially causing damage; in the roadway example, this would
                                            Low Voltage
                                            Low voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels. There are actually many technical definitions of what constitutes a low voltage system that vary by industry and country; for example, in the US, a low voltage system is one operating at 100V or less. 
                                            Some examples of common low voltage systems are included in the following tabs:

                                            Network/Data Circuits
                                            Wiring circuits for building and equipment controls systems run at a multitude of voltages and tend to vary most with the age of the system or facility. In newer installations (within the last decade or two), you will most frequently run across 24V controls systems. Voltage is dictated by the types of components and controllers on the circuits, but the trend is moving towards standardization to increase the commonality of repair parts (wiring harnesses, power modules, backup batteries, etc.).

                                            Medium Voltage 
                                            Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
                                            Operators working in Critical Operations should be most concerned about the medium voltage systems in their day-to-day tasks, primarily due to the various levels of specified protective equipment and safety regulations required to operate and maintain the power components within a medium voltage system. In this case, dedicated safety and technical training is required, but stops short of needing a full electrical license or advanced preparations.

                                            The following tabs includes some examples of common voltages falling within the medium voltage range and their common applications:

                                            Especially in the Critical Operations industry, high voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers. Some large-scale manufacturing or power generation systems may have high voltage components inside the facility, downstream of the utility supply and backup power systems, but they will be highly specialized to the location 
                                            Live high voltage circuits are incredibly dangerous to work around since there is no protective gear in existence that can protect an operator from the hazards associated with an electrical fault. Operators and technicians rarely perform maintenance on these systems as it is left to utility electricians or specialty contractors due to the infrequency of operation and the levels of knowledge required to do so safely. However, protective gear should be worn even when operating breakers and switches at these voltages with the housings fully closed. 

                                            Current
                                            Electrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire. Current takes into account both the volume of electrons in the circuit and the speed in which they are moving, which is the circuit's voltage. 
                                            Amperes
                                            Amperes, represented by the shortened term amps or the letter A, is the unit of measure for expressing the flow rate of an electric charge, or current. Scientifically speaking, one ampere is equal to the current flowing in two parallel wires, one meter apart, producing a force of 2x10-7 newtons per meter. Current, expressed in amps, is measured by using an instrument called an ammeter.

                                            Power measures the work done (or the potential work that can be done) by electricity. Specifically, power is the rate at which a given amount of energy is transferred through an electrical circuit. The power of a system can be calculated using the simplified equation, power = voltage x current. 
                                            Power Factor
                                            In a real, operating electrical system, there are many components that are influenced by their environment that create inefficiencies. So how do you bridge the gap between ideal physics and real-world function?
                                            By using the power factor, a concept generally calculated indirectly as the ratio of real power (the amount of energy actually available or used) to apparent power (the potential power purely available in an ideal system with no losses). A power factor of 1.0 in a system is referred to as a "unity" and represents perfect conditions

                                            Direct current (DC) is a constant flow of electricity that travels in one direction. It is the "original" type of electrical power, or that which is produced by batteries. In a DC system, both voltage and current are constant, and there is another variable at play: resistance, which is the innate property of most conductors that creates opposition to the passage of an electrical current. Resistance is measured in ohms, represented by the symbol Œ©, named after the German physicist who discovered this property.

                                            Three-Phase Power
                                            Single-phase power is a specific type of AC power distribution where a single conductor carries one waveform of current, or multiple conductors carry multiple currents with matching waveforms. A single-phase AC power supply does not create a magnetic field in the motor it is connected to, and therefore needs additional circuits to start the motor. 
                                            For this reason, single-pha

                                            A transformer is an electrical device that changes voltage in an AC circuit‚Äîeither increasing it or decreasing it‚Äîby varying the current flowing through the conductor's internal wires using a process called electromagnetic induction. Basically, it manipulates the characteristics of the rotating electromagnetic fields that create AC power in the first place, in order to ‚Äústep up‚Äù or ‚Äústep down‚Äù the AC voltage supplied. Most commonly, transformers are used to reduce the voltage as it works its way down through the electrical distribution system from high-voltage utility supplies to the end-use equipment. 
                                            se power is the most common power distribution scheme for residential and light duty commercial environments, which use few large motors or no motors at all.

                                            Watts and Kilowatts
                                            A watt is the global standard for measuring electrical power and has a value of one joule per second. One watt is not a tremendous amount of energy, so you may often encounter the measurement of a kilowatt‚Äîor 1,000 watts.

                                            Grounding
                                            Grounding is the process of removing excess electrical charge and distributing it to a larger body capable of receiving that charge. Most commonly, that charge is sent down to the earth via a conductor.
                                             
                                            The easiest way to think about grounding is lightning itself. The atmosphere and clouds accumulate charged particles due to the changing weather conditions. The charge then finds the earth as a happy receptor for all of that energy. Now consider the use of lightning rods: where the lightning bolt was an uncontrolled discharge of these particles, a lightning rod can be used to accept the excess charge and purposefully move that current through a conductor safely to the ground.
                                            Three-Wire vs. Four-Wire Power Cords
                                            A three-wire power cord has three wires: one hot, one neutral, and one ground. A four-wire power cord has four wires: two hot, one neutral, and one ground. 
                                            The ground wire serves the same protective purpose in both types. The neutral wire is perhaps even more complex than the concept of grounding, as it can serve multiple purposes. For the sake of comparing power cords, however, it is easiest to consider the neutral conductor as the return path for the electrical circuit. What sets these two applications apart is that having two hot conductors allows delivery of power at two different voltages (to different components in the equipment), both of which can share the neutral path. 
                                            Power Density
                                            Power density is a concept most pertinent to design and construction, but is of increasing importance in electrical system fundamentals. Just as the name implies, it refers to the quantity of power consumed in a given infrastructure footprint. 
                                            This could be a vertical power density, such as in the spaces of a vertical server rack in a data center; or lateral power density, such as the equipment in a manufacturing space. Power density is one of the main bridges between electrical and mechanical cooling design,
                                            Generator-Provided Power
                                            While utility-based power is the optimal source of electrical power for Critical Operations, there will always be a need for a backup power supply. For this, generator-provided power is the most common source of backup energy. But, of course, there are many types of backup generators and fuels that can be used to power them, and different types of system components to safely switch between the two sources of power. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it will be vitally important for you to have a strong working knowledge of generator-provided power and how to integrate this source of backup power into your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the different types of generator-provided power and the system components used to implement them safely
                                            because it tells us not only how much heat-generating equipment needs to be cooled, but how concentrated the cooling needs to be.

                                            Generators are by far the most recognizable and widely implemented source of backup electrical power for Critical Operations. 
                                            A generator is a machine used to convert mechanical energy of some kind into electrical energy. By industry standards, the terms "generator" and "generator set" are often used interchangeably, but in fairness, the generator itself is the part of the system making electricity and the generator set is the engine attached to the generator that provides the mechanical energy. 
                                            Another term that you may find used to refer to any machine providing electricity is prime mover, since there are a few Critical Operation designs that use something other than an engine to turn a rotor and generate electrici

                                            There are different types of generators that are rated for use in certain situations, based on their size and function. The intended use within Critical Operationss typically guides which type of generator is the best fit for a system.

                                            Stand-by generator sets are exactly as the name implies: purely backup systems. These engines are off, in a normal state, but fully operational and waiting on a start command to fire up and power Critical Operations.  Stand-by generators may be required to operate for extended periods of time in large emergencies, but ideally only need to run for a few hours during a utility outage. Typically, a stand-by generator will have some more rugged components installed, such as heavy-duty starters and starting batteries, pre-lubrication pumps, and jacket water heaters, so as to be able to start immediately during any condition.
                                            Fuel Types
                                            Traditionally, the prime mover for a generator set is an internal combustion engine. An internal combustion engine can run on a variety of fuel types, with diesel, fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas being the most common engine fuels in use. 
                                            However, there are some pros and cons to evaluate when considering what type of engine/fuel type is best for Critical Operations. Click on the following tabs to explore:

                                            Natural Gas
                                            The term "diesel fuel" is the commonly accepted shorthand for off-road diesel #2, a particular type of petroleum-based fuel that is not the same as the ‚Äúhighway use‚Äù diesel you might fill up your truck with. Diesel #2 is a particular grade of refinement that would not meet the emissions requirements for use on roadways in most states. It is also usually colored with a red dye to denote its off-road use. Utilizes the heat and pressure created by compression as its means of starting.

                                            Automatic Transfer Switches
                                            An automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a particularly helpful component that acts as an independent traffic director of sorts, to ensure that power is being supplied from the most optimal source available. While ATSs exist in many places throughout Critical Operations installations, ATSs at the main utility input are of unique importance since they perform a few extra duties. 
                                            Think of an ATS as a ‚ÄúY‚Äù gate, with the top of the Y connecting to two different power sources; in this case, the utility-source and the generator. The bottom of the Y heads off to whatever load is being supported. The ATS has two main parts: a control panel and the switch. The control panel is always monitoring power quality signals from both sources and is programmed to have a primary and alternate source. 
                                            Fig. 2-13: A diagram of an automatic transfer switch (ATS).
                                            Throw-Over Switches
                                            A throw-over switch, or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but without the automatic control features. Some switches still have control panels that will provide an alert or alarm when conditions reach set thresholds, although they will require an operator to physically make the transfer.
                                            Paralleling Switchgear
                                            Paralleling switchgear are large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout the system. Specifically, they are used to switch the power source for the load, provide load sharing capabilities, operate the generator, meter the output, and protect the generator from any potential malfunctions. aralleling switchgear is an especially vital component for Critical Operations with multiple backup generators, specifically because of its multiple moving parts. 
                                            Think of it this way: generators are rotating machines, providing an AC output of a certain frequency, voltage, and waveform. Since it is constantly in flux‚Äîsay, 60 Hz, or 60 cycles of the waveform every second‚Äîyou can imagine how difficult it could be to match two "moving" AC sources from multiple power supplies. Closing the AC output from the generator to transfer it to the facility bus with AC power still running through it will have disastrous consequences if the two AC signals are not closely matched: most likely, an explosion! 
                                            Modern paralleling switchgear is controlled electronically by logic boards to remove the need for operators to be standing at the switchgear, manually closing the breakers. Until the generator output breaker has closed to support the Critical Operations load, it is the variable source, and the control boards in the switchgear will usually make minor tweaks to the speed of the engine in order to align the AC waveforms
                                            Uninterruptible Power Supplies
                                            By now, you have a strong understanding of the two main types of power that can be provided to your Critical Operations: the consistent power supplied from the utility-source and the backup power supplied from a generator. These are likely the two sources you are most familiar with, just from day-to-day use; you may have even used a generator before to supply power to your own home. But, there is another source of backup power that is a commonly-used, critical component of any Critical Operation: an uninterruptible power supply. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it is imperative that you understand the purpose of an uninterruptible power supply and be able to choose between the different types that are available in order to best serve your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the types of uninterruptible power supplies.
                                            UPS
                                            An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device or machine that provides immediate emergency power when the primary power source fails, using electrical energy stored within the device itself. UPSs are a critical component of a Critical Operations power system because they are designed to provide clean and continuous power to Critical Operations during power interruptions and eliminate abnormal fluctuations from the power source as delivered.
                                            Electricity delivered from the utility power source is never ‚Äúclean power,‚Äù often experiencing spikes, sags, and occasional interruptions. These power abnormalities can wreak havoc on the IT load and other critical equipment serving Critical Operations and even severely damage them. UPSs protect these systems by providing temporary backup power for brief outages and absorbing those spikes and sags, ensuring the power delivered is within acceptable tolerances and specification for critical consumption. UPSs are not designed to sustain power supply for long periods of time, but rather long enough to engage another alternative source of power, such as a power generator, to accept the electrical load.

                                            UPSs vary in design and method of application, but the basic function of a UPS follows the same principle. A UPS accepts AC power from the provided source, stores a portion of the energy in a backup battery system, and delivers the remaining to the critical connected equipment. In order to perform this vital function, the UPS requires three key components: a charger/rectifier, a battery or other storage mechanism (typically, a flywheel), and an inverter. The charger/rectifier converts the input AC power to DC power for battery charging, and the inverter converts the battery power to AC power during a power interruption.
                                            Flywheels
                                            As an alternative to a battery system, flywheels can be used with a UPS to support continuous power requirements. A flywheel is a mechanical-type storage device that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis. The electrical input spins the flywheel rotor up to speed where it remains fully charged in stand-by mode, 24/7, until a power interruption requires its activation. When this occurs, the flywheel provides back-up power immediately, while the system monitors for proper electrical input. If this condition persists for a specified time frame measured in seconds, the system transfers to a more permanent power source such as the backup generator system. 
                                            This technology is relatively cost-effective and environmentally friendly as opposed to the traditional lead acid battery system. Although the initial cost of batteries is relatively low, the cost of maintaining, replacing, and disposing of batteries over the long term must be taken into consideration. Flywheel technology can also work alongside a battery system if desired, and is highly effective at absorbing the abnormal electrical inputs as the first line of defense, thus prolonging the life of the storage batteries.
                                            Line Interactive UPS
                                            A line interactive UPS combines the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit. 
                                            This system limits transient voltages when switching and increases the speed of the changeover from main power to backup battery power. Because of this design, a line inverter UPS does not have to resort to batteries as often as other systems; instead, it utilizes some of its battery power only to support the transition from normal mode to voltage regulation mode.
                                            Fig. 2.16 - A schematic of a line interactive UPS, showing how it operates (or doesn't operate)at various levels of voltage.

                                            Double Conversion UPS
                                            A double conversion UPS converts all AC power to DC power, some of which is utilized for battery charging, while the rest is simply converted back to AC power to provide power to the critical load. The double conversion aims to prevent any possibility of an abnormal power event reaching the equipment downstream. 
                                            Although the double conversion method is highly successful in providing continuous power from outages and power quality anomalies, it is also less efficient due to the power loss during the conversion process and the generation of additional heat, which creates a higher demand on the cooling systems. 
                                            Delta Conversion UPS
                                            The delta conversion UPS was designed to address some of the issues of a double conversion UPS, and therefore has a few similarities. Like the double conversion UPS, the inverter in a delta conversion UPS is always supplying the load voltage; however, it also uses a special transformer configuration to interface between the utility supplied power and the electrical load. 
                                            A ‚Äúdelta‚Äù converter in the transformer regulates the input current and power and also delivers power to the inverter output. During normal conditions, the delta converter allows the UPS to deliver power to the load with greater efficiency than t
                                            Rotary UPS
                                            In a rotary UPS, a motor generator or some variation of rotating components are utilized to transfer power to the load via rotating generation. Whenever power is supplied within an acceptable range of frequency and voltage, the motor mechanism is driven directly from the utility power source as delivered, and therefore also supports the critical load. At this point the rectifier/inverter remain in a stand-by mode while acceptable power is monitored. 
                                            If and when the supplied utility power parameters fall outside of specifications, the rectifier/inverter begin to supply power to the motor and thus to the generator portion of the UPS to support the load. The energy stored in the stand-by batteries provide sufficient power momentarily until an alternate source, such as stand-by generators, can come up to speed and incur the electrical load.

                                            Diesel Rotary UPS
                                            A diesel rotary UPS combines a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS with a diesel generator to supply backup power for the load. It actually consists of five key components: a motor generator, flywheel, choke, mechanical clutch, and a diesel engine. 
                                            Under normal and uninterrupted conditions, the local utility power is fed to the critical equipment load via the choke and motor sub-system, otherwise known as the filter. This same source of power also feeds the flywheel to retain kinetic energy storage capability in the event of a power interruption. When utility supplied power is interrupted, alternate power is supplied by the rotating flywheel to the motor generator unit, which provides adequate power for a few seconds until the diesel engine can start and accelerate to full speed. At this point the clutch is engaged, enabling mechanical power to be supplied to the motor generator to sustain continuous electricity to the critical load. 
                                            In most cases, diesel rotary UPSs are a fixed asset and are rarely modular. Future growth relating to power requirements must be considered upon the initial engineering calculations to ensure capabilities are somewhat oversized. Since these are diesel powered, special ventilation and purging equipment for fumes may be required, as well as potentially constructing a separate building or enclosures to support these system
                                            Load Bus Synchronization
                                            Load Bus Synchronization (LBS) is an engineering method to keep the output of two independent UPSs in sync, even if they are operating from two different sources of supplied power. In general, a UPS in a multiple-UPS system will automatically sync to its own bypass source, as long as all of the UPSs are tied to the same input source. However, imagine if these UPSs were operating off of different back-up generators, batteries, or another bypass source. In these scenarios, their outputs will always tend to drift out of sync and cause problems within the electrical load. 
                                            The LBS system functions by continuously monitoring the sync reference signals of two UPS modules. It remains in a dormant state until the output of the UPS modules drift out of predetermined operational parameters‚Äîor out of sync‚Äîat which point the LBS activates and manipulates the output of each UPS module until they once again fall in sync with each other. Once completed, the LBS once again returns to its dormant state of operation.
                                            Batteries
                                            So far, the sources of power you have learned about are typically used on a larger scale, providing power to a whole system or the large components within it. When it comes to providing power to smaller devices or equipment (or, sometimes, even a secondary source of power), batteries are a familiar and typical solution; however, not all batteries are best suited for use in a Critical Operation environment. 
                                            As a facilities operator, you will need to be able to differentiate between the different types of batteries and select the one that is best for your particular Critical Operation‚Äôs needs. 
                                            Fig. 2.17
                                            A battery is a device that converts stored chemical energy into electricity via a process in which free electrons move between a positively charged terminal (called a cathode) and a negatively charged terminal (called an anode) through a solution favorable to this process (called the electrolyte). All of these things together, within a container, is called a jar or cell (although some battery designs include multiple sets of terminals such that one jar may have several cells within it). 
                                            There are numerous types of batteries which are differentiated based on the materials used for the cathode, anode, and the electrolyte (as well as a few other secondary variables).
                                             
                                            A battery system is simply a set, or sets, of individual battery cells wired together in strings in order to achieve higher voltages, capacities, or redundancies.
                                            For much of history, the type of batteries that were being used were what would be considered primary batteries, meaning they were really only useful for one full discharge before having to be scrapped or have at least one component replaced. With the advent of rechargeable, or secondary batteries, a charge could be applied to the battery which would convert the electricity back to chemical energy to store for future use. 
                                            In Critical Operations, only the latter type of battery system is typically used, and therefore these types of batteries will be focused on here.
                                            Lead Acid Batteries
                                            Lead acid batteries are widely prevalent and come in many options available for commercial/ industrial scale usage in MCOs. In a lead acid battery, the positive terminal is made of lead-oxide (PbO2), the negative terminal is made of lead (Pb), and the electrolyte solution that fills the container is some concentration of sulfuric-acid (H2SO4). The chemical reaction amongst the three components produces the voltage for the battery. 
                                            Flooded wet cell batteries are the original form of lead acid batteries and simply have the cathode and anode fully submerged in the electrolyte solution. The top of the battery is covered, with the terminals protruding for connection, and two ports: a vent and a fill port. As part of the chemical reaction releasing and storing energy in the battery, the acid (in this case, H2SO4) and some water (H2O) molecules are broken apart, releasing hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gasses. This gas needs to be vented in order to prevent over-pressurization of the battery, hence the need for the vent. Some of the solution can also evaporate over time, so to maintain the cathode and anode fully submerged, de-ionized water may need to be added to the jar from time to time. 
                                            Valve Regulated Lead Acid batteries (VRLA) are an advancement of lead-acid battery technology and have been in wide use for decades now. This battery design utilizes a specialized one-way pressure release valve, only releasing gasses when pressure is actually beginning to rise to certain levels (whereas the flooded wet cell tends to release most all gas produced). By forcing the gasses to stay within the jar, they become re-absorbed by the solution, attach to the cathode and/or anode, and through ionic exchange reactions, form water again. This is a process commonly referred to as recombinant technology and delivers two main benefits: increased safety protection from over-pressurization and/or dangerous gas release, as well as virtually eliminating the need to ever refill a jar.
                                            Lithium-Ion Batteries
                                            Lithium-ion batteries are relative newcomers to the world of battery technologies, bringing many benefits along with them. In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is a lithium oxide material, the anode is typically a carbon-based material, and the electrolyte is a liquid consisting of lithium salts and an organic solvent. The basic operation is still the same: a chemical reaction causes ion exchange with is then converted, stored, and used as electricity. In this case, positively charged lithium ions (Li+) are shared back and forth between the two terminals, creating the voltage for the battery.
                                            Fig. 2.18 - A schematic of a lithium-ion battery.
                                            Fig. 2.18 - A schematic of a lithium-ion battery.
                                            There are certainly many advantages to using lithium-ion batteries, including the higher voltages that can be produced, a more compact design, a longer lifespan and recharging efficiency, and little to no maintenance; however,
                                            Nickel Cadmium Batteries
                                            Nickel Cadmium (NiCd or NiCad) batteries are another style of popular modern batteries. In a nickel cadmium battery, the cathode is a cadmium material, the anode is a nickel oxide material, and the electrolyte is an alkaline. 
                                            Principles of operation remain the same as other types of batteries, although in this case it is the chemical reaction between the two terminals that creates the voltage for the battery. NiCd batteries tend to be smaller‚Äîgenerally, between the scale of lithium-ion batteries and other lead acid batteries‚Äîbut do not have the higher voltage characteristics of lithium-ion. They are, however, extremely robust and durable, having both impressive recharge lifetimes and the ability to handle a wide range of electrical activity. Typically, in Critical Operations, NiCd batteries will be used to operate switchgear or machinery but not to the scale of full-system (i.e., UPS) support.
                                            they also have their disadvantages, including high-temperature concerns and more expensive production.

                                            Utility-Source Power
                                            The next important concept to discuss, once you understand the fundamentals of power, is where power comes from. There are a myriad of energy sources in use today, and that list keeps growing as old sources fall out of fashion and new sources are discovered or developed. Of these sources, utility-source power is one of the most common sources of energy and the one you are probably most familiar with since you see it and use it on a daily basis. 
                                            As a facilities operation professional, you will need to know where your power comes from and understand the nuances of how and how much power comes into your Critical Operations facility from the source. In this topic, you will identify utility-based sources of power.
                                            Utility power refers to the electricity that Critical Operations receive from external sources, typically from a combination of public and privately-owned power plants, as well as public and regulated private/ semi-private utility distribution companies that are part of "the grid." Speaking at a high level, the grid is the collective system of transmission lines, switching, and substations involved in providing utility power. Generally speaking (with Texas being a notable exception) the national grid is a highly regulated, shared domestic public resource, although it may be operated and maintained by a mix of the organizations listed above. 
                                            Domestic power is produced from multiple energy sources‚Äîthe list of which is almost constantly growing due to the advent of various renewable energy sources.

                                            Click on the following tabs to explore the most common sources that provide utility power:
                                            Coal
                                            Coal-fueled power generation plants supply about half the electricity in the United States. Coal is the original fossil fuel and receives the most press regarding the environmental impact of its use. It is formed over long periods of time as geological processes build up over layers of biological material‚Äîmostly plants. Coal is extracted from the earth via mining. 
                                            The basic concept for creating power from coal is common to most electricity generation plants: create a heat source to turn water into pressurized steam which may then transmit mechanical energy to a turbine. The rotation of the turbine may directly, or indirectly, spin the rotor of a generator set.

                                            When discussing utility supply power levels, there is some difficulty in clearly quantifying power levels, particularly the upper and lower boundaries for medium voltage systems. For the purposes of grid connections, let's just consider the utility supply lines at the point where Critical Operations take ownership; the voltage at that location will determine what other substation and transformer equipment Critical Operations need, and perhaps most critically, the backup power source.
                                            Some Critical Operations take the full 100+ kVA supply from the utility main transmission line and have large substations onsite. Some take power from the utility that's been stepped down once to something closer to 12-15kVA but also have generators that operate at that same level, so the final step-down happens inside the facility, regardless of where the power is being supplied from. Still others take power that's been fully reduced to site operating levels (typically 480V) via a utility reducing station and a ‚Äúcampus‚Äù reducing station, and then also run their generators at this voltage.



                                            Determining the appropriate incoming power supply voltage for Critical Operations is a balancing act either driven by money or end-use (both the equipment being used and operations team using it). At the lowest levels, the operational benefit is not having to deal with large transformers or higher voltage switchgear onsite. However, designing a system with a lower voltage limits, to a certain extent, any further expansion of Critical Operations; it would be incredibly costly to have to install a step-up transformer or bring a new, higher kVA feed into Critical Operations if a new piece of machinery needed it.
                                            On the flip side, high voltage distribution is much more energy efficient. There are losses associated with the distance that electricity has to run, and there is always some loss from moving the electricity through the various power equipment in the system (transformers, substation gear, etc.). Transmission losses increase at lower voltages. So for example, taking a 112kVA or 36kVA feed from the utility, stepping down once to 14kVA, running generators at 14kVA, and then utilizing smaller transformers close to the end-use gear is
                                            Microgrids
                                            A microgrid is a small-scale, localized utility-source system that can disconnect from the larger, more traditional utility-source grid (i.e., the public or privately-owned power plants and distribution centers) either partially or completely. A microgrid can operate autonomously, providing its own generation, storage, and transmission of electrical energy, though typically at a low voltage. In this way, it is an excellent source of both small-scale energy production and a powerful backup option for any interruptions to the power provided by the larger utility-source grid. 
                                            With all this in mind, you may think that any Critical Operations with a backup power source would be considered a microgrid, but that's not entirely accurate. This is particularly relevant in a campus setting, where the backup power will be the supply for multiple loads, both critical and non-critical, and needs to be able do so for an extended period of time. 
                                            Additionally, using only a petro-fuel based generator as the sole source of power, without the support of the main utility grid, is limited by how much fuel storage is onsite (and subsequently, how often fuel deliveries would be required). A true microgrid setup is going to have some kind of co-generation plant and/or standalone power plant such as biomass, solar, or wind power.

                                            High vs. Medium Voltage Systems
                                            When discussing utility supply power levels, there is some difficulty in clearly quantifying power levels, particularly the upper and lower boundaries for medium voltage systems.

                                            Alternative Power Sources
                                            Most of the power sources you are familiar with are the more traditional types, such as utility-supplied or battery-supplied. These days, there are more alternative energy sources available as we look to find clean, renewable options for power. As the technology improves, these alternative power sources are becoming more available and prevalent in both residential and commercial implementations‚Äîincluding Critical Operations. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it will benefit you to be aware of these alternative power sources and be prepared to potentially interact with them in a Critical Operations facility. In this topic, you will identify alternative sources of power. 

                                            Fuel Cells
                                            A fuel cell converts stored chemical energy into electricity using a chemical reaction between positively charged ions and an oxidizing agent. 
                                            Like batteries, they are made up of three segments: the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte; unlike batteries, however, fuel cells require a continuous source of fuel and air to operate. In a fuel cell, the chemical reaction occurs where the three segments interface, such that the fuel is consumed, water or other gases are created as a waste product, and an electric current is produced. As long as the sources are supplied, the fuel cell will continue to produce electrical energy. 
                                            The most common and familiar type of fuel cell is likely the hydrogen fuel cell, which requires hydrogen (H2) fuel and air (O2) as the sources. During the chemical reaction at the segments, some O2 molecules are stripped from the air and some are stripped from the water (H2O) molecules, leaving more H2 to act as fuel. In the end, the remaining broken-apart, ionized hydrogen (H+) and oxygen molecules re-combine to form water as the was
                                            Fuel cells have been making inroads in several industries‚Äînotably, transportation and propulsion, in addition to power generation‚Äîdue to their capability to make renewable, mostly clean energy (wastewater being the one downfall). For large-scale implementations, fuel cells can be an expensive capital investment but have relatively low cost of operation. Power density is approaching that of traditional diesel/gas generators, so Critical Operations of any size would still require a small array of fuel cells, but they can provide continuous power more indefinitely than generators.
                                            Fig. 2.19 - A schematic of a hydrogen fuel cell shows how energy is created from the chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen.

                                            Solar Power
                                            One of the cleanest alternative energy sources available is right above you: the sun. To understand the potential alternative energy source that is solar power, consider this: on average, the Earth receives enough solar radiation each day to equal about seven times the amount of total global consumption. The photovoltaic (PV) cells on solar panels can capture the sun's energy and provide a clean, renewable source of electric power and yet‚Äîunfortunately‚Äîcurrent commercially available solar panels are only about 20% efficient, making it a widely available but underutilized source of energy.
                                            Fig. 2.20 - Long rows of solar panels on a solar farm in Sharon, Vermont.
                                            Fig.
                                            Aside from the lack of efficiency, the current limiting factor for solar power production and usage is real estate. Panels simply take up a lot of linear space, so their viability as an alternative energy source depends largely upon how deep the owner or developer's pockets are. 
                                            Whether you are deciding between implementing solar panels as input to a local grid or as on-site supplemental power, the decision factors are largely the same. PV manufacturing technology has improved sufficiently enough in the last decade that construction and labor costs are the major variables that may provide economies of scale; the PV cells/panels themselves have become quite affordable in relation to the overall investment. 
                                            However, much like microprocessors changed the face of electronics and computing, the next breakthrough in solar technology will certainly bring it to the forefront of most power planning discussions. If solar technology can reach a point where it is capable of generating two to four times the amount of power on the same amount of land (or the same power in a fraction of the footprint), solar power could rival hydroelectric power as a leader in renewable energy production. 
                                            For Critical Operations in particular, it is important to keep in mind that‚Äîeven without a solution to grid-scale power storage limitations‚Äîcreating solar power is nearly free (minus the initial capital investment) to generate during daylight hours when strains on the utility grid and electricity prices are highest.
                                            Wind Power
                                            Wind power also ranks very highly as a clean, sustainable alternative energy source. Wind turbines are simply large fans that convert the mechanical energy of the wind to electricity by turning the rotor of a standard generator. These are highly efficient machines as virtually the only source of energy loss is overcoming friction in turning the rotor.
                                            Fig. 2.21 - Wind turbines on a wind farm in Idaho. In 2011, wind power generated 8% of the state's total electricity.
                                            Biomass
                                            Biomass is a broad term encompassing virtually all renewable, organic materials‚Äîfrom old wood pallets, to discarded crops, to ‚Äúmunicipal waste‚Äù as the dictionary gently puts it‚Äîthat can be treated in some manner (shredded, compressed, composted, etc.) and burned for fuel. Then, just like most other power plants, the heat is generally used to drive steam or gas turbines to create electricity. 
                                            Fig. 2.22 - The biomass plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina burns forest residue to provide power to the rest of the campus, which produces nuclear materials for the U.S.Department of Energy.
                                            Fig. 2.22 - The biomass plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina burns forest residue to
                                            While the by-products of biomass are not quite as bad as coal or other fossil fuel plants, burning is still burning; in this regard, biomass should be considered a cleaner alternative energy than some of the others, speaking strictly from the energy production process. 
                                            However, if you take into account the fact that much of the biomass fuel sources are often headed for landfills, or require additional energy to recycle or treat, removing these items from the waste chain does actually have a notably positive effect on the environment.
                                            Currently, the largest hurdle for biomass power plants is the fuel supply chain. There is certainly no shortage of fuel products, but industries have not been fully established to process these sources in a manner desirable for a particular plant design. 
                                            Plant designs can be easily modified for any primary source, or combination of fuels, but once it's built, it's committed. While many large-scale biomass power plants also process their own fuel onsite, it is simply not practical to build processing capabilities for all types of biomass sources; as a result, most biomass plants usually stick to producing the one or two sources that are the most heavily used in the serviceable area
                                            Supercapacitors
                                            Capacitors, specifically electrochemical capacitors, are another category of energy storage devices, typically used on smaller scales than batteries. They can store very small amounts of electric potential. 
                                            For example, think about the minuscule amount of charge it takes for an electronic device to keep track of time. The battery on your phone may have died, or your computer may have been unplugged for weeks, and yet when you connect to a primary power source and boot it up; it still knows what time it is.

                                            Co-Generated Power
                                            In a co-generated power system, some fuel source (nuclear, coal, gas, biomass, etc.) is used to create steam for turbine generators, and then the leftover heat is extracted from the exhausted waste steam (or condensate) and is used to provide power for other central services (such as space heating or water heating). 
                                            Co-generation plants are an economical, if not thrifty, alternative power source that is primarily found in campus settings because of the ability to utilize the co-generated energy to power a central service for multiple buildings on the site, if not the entire campus. 
                                            While it is still not common for most Critical Operations facilities to be generating their own primary power on site (with a few large-scale exceptions), the co-generation concept is one that facilility technicians and operators are finding great success in implementing after the fact. Anything that generates heat can be considered a candidate for co-generation. 
                                            For instance, a communications center that finally decides to install a solar array on the roof could then install a bypass loop to its hot water heater and run tubes within or behind the array to collect its heat. Or machinery with compressors or motors in a manufacturing plant could be hooded in some manner, and ductwork could be put in place to pump the hot air back into people spaces during colder months to augment installed electric heaters.
                                            harge‚Äîis measured in a unit called the farad (named for the acclaimed 19th century English scientist Michael Faraday).

                                            Geothermal Power
                                            Geothermal power uses the natural thermal energy‚Äîin short, heat‚Äîgenerated and stored in the earth to act as either a nascent heat source or a power source. Geothermal power is a dual-faceted alternative energy source: these underground heat sources can either be utilized directly in heat exchangers that create hot air or hot water (mostly for comfort uses, like office areas) or provide the supply power to heat engines that in turn generate moderate amounts of electricity.
                                            Fig. 2.24 - Steam rises from the stacks of a geothermal power plant in Iceland.

                                            The main points from this module are as follows:

                                                Electricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles.
                                                Voltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them.
                                                A volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity.
                                                Low voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels.
                                                Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
                                                High voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers.
                                                Electrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire.

                                                The most common sources that provide utility power: coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind.
                                                A microgrid is a small-scale, localized utility-source system that can disconnect from the larger, more traditional utility-source grid (i.e., the public or privately-owned power plants and distribution centers) either partially or completely.
                                                A generator is a machine used to convert mechanical energy of some kind into electrical energy.
                                                An automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a particularly helpful component that acts as an independent traffic director of sorts, to ensure that power is being supplied from the most optimal source available.
                                                A throw-over switch, or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but without the automatic control features.
                                                Paralleling switchgear are large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout the system.
                                                A flywheel is a mechanical-type storage device that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis.
                                                A line interactive UPS combines the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit.
                                                A double conversion UPS converts all AC power to DC power, some of which is utilized for battery charging, while the rest is simply converted back to AC power to provide power to the critical load

                                            Upon completion of this module you will be able to:

                                                Compare and contrast medium and low voltage systems for power distribution. 
                                                Describe redundancy levels. 
                                                Identify the elements of power supply transfer.

                                                Identify and apply electrical protection techniques. 
                                                Discuss preventative maintenance procedures for power distribution components.

                                            Power Distribution
                                            Power distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source‚Äîeither externally from the utility or internally from generators‚Äîand then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load. 
                                            In a Critical Operations Infrastructure, power is generally supplied via the local utility substation to the facility at a predetermined and fixed voltage. From there, the power must be harnessed, distributed, and stepped down to various voltages suitable for the customer's critical load, and that's where the various components of the power distribution come in‚Äîcomponents including uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), substations, power distribution units (PDUs), electrical switchgear, transformers, circuit breakers, power supply cables, and other equipment that you'll learn more about.

                                            PDUS
                                            A power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs‚Äî typically in the form of outlets‚Äîdesigned to distribute electrical power to multiple devices. 
                                            Generally a PDU in an A/C circuit is engineered with a power transformer to step down 480VAC to 120/208VAC to provide conditioned power from a centralized UPS or generator to racks and computers of network equipment. A PDU may have the capability to accommodate power supply to multiple equipment racks or server cabinets. 
                                            PDUs vary in design and use, and may be as simple as inexpensive rack-mounted power strips to much larger and expensive floor-mounted machines with complex functions.

                                            Low Voltage vs. Medium Voltage Systems

                                            Low Voltage
                                            Medium Voltage
                                            In the context of critical environments, low voltage electrical systems are generally categorized as those systems operating at voltages up to 1000 volts (or 1kV). 
                                            Power coming from the utility-source is delivered at a much higher voltage (typically closer to that of a medium voltage system) so it must be stepped down to low voltage, which can be done via a three phase transformer in the low voltage system. 
                                            The low voltage bus (a device in the power system that evaluates the voltage, current, or flow of energy within the system) then distributes this stepped down electrical power to the various loads in the facility, such as IT equipment loads, PDU converters, lighting, and cooling systems.
                                            N.B. Attempting to define low voltage, medium voltage, and high voltage can be tricky because these levels vary depending on specific application guidelines, the context of the application, and sometimes even the electrical parameters tha
                                            Multiple-Source and Multiple-Feed Power
                                            In the ideal situation, the critical facility will be fed from multiple power sources‚Äîmaybe even more than one power plant. Additionally, the substations, switches, transformers and UPSs within a specific system will influence how electrical power is transferred to and throughout the facility. Dependent upon the design, quantity, placement, and redundancy capabilities of each will define the true meaning of multiple-source or multiple-feed power.
                                            Note: Redundancy refers to the "extra" components of a system that are typically used solely for backup during critical times, like an outage or failure. It will be covered in greater detail in the next topic.
                                            There are four types of multiple-source/multiple-feed power configurations, each with their own distinguishing characteristics:

                                                Single feed/single substation
                                                Multiple feed/single substation
                                                Multiple substation
                                                True dual/multiple feed

                                            t have been determined by the authority having jurisdiction.
                                            Single Feed/Single Substation
                                            In this configuration, a facility is supported by one substation with a single power line and a single input feed to the utility transformer(s). 
                                            Facilities that are supplied power in this manner can be vulnerable to a high risk of failure and critical operations interruption. While it might be supported by multiple transformers (giving it the appearance of backup redundancy), if this single substation and single feed failed to provide power, all equipment downstream would fail as well.
                                            Multiple Feed/Single Substation
                                            In this configuration, there is a single power line with a manual or automatic throw-over switch from the one substation and a single input feed to the utility transformer(s). The throw-over switch will manually or automatically transfer to the second feed if power is interrupted from the main feed.
                                            Facilities supported by a single substation with a multiple feed from that substation are at a somewhat reduced risk of failure when compared to a single feed and single substation; however, this configuration still poses a significant failure risk as the facility is relying on one substation for power supply.
                                            Fig. 3.4
                                            Fig. 3.
                                            Multiple Substation
                                            In this configuration, there are two power lines (one from each substation), single input feeds to each transformer, and one throw-over switch connecting the two substation outputs. Upon a substation failure, the throw-over switch will manually or automatically transfer to connect to the other substation.
                                            Facilities supported by multiple substations gain the advantage of increased redundancy with limited single point failure opportunities. In this case, the throw-over switch is the most prominent single failure source. Failing to transfer after a substation power interruption will create the necessity for the facility to rotate to an alternative source of electrical generation to maintain the critical load.

                                            Efficiency
                                            Specific to Critical Operations, efficiency refers to the ability to deliver the same desired critical operations while using less energy, incurring lower costs (namely, utility costs), and/or requiring less involvement or maintenance by specialized technicians. 
                                            Reducing costs and improving efficiency are elements that are under the microscope at every opportunity. From initial construction, operations, and repair, it is always a balancing act of ensuring continuous operations of the facility at a cost that is acceptable to the business. To do so, many design engineers are increasingly choosing medium-voltage power distribution over low-voltage power distribution within their critical facilities. 
                                            In any power system, the larger the load current and the larger the conductor resistance, the larger the voltage drop between the utility-source and the distribution system. A medium voltage distribution system helps to reduce drops in voltage from the utility service to the load, therefore increasing the overall effectiveness of the distribution system. Low voltage distribution systems generally have much longer feeder runs and must be designed to be oversized in an effort to compensate for the resistance of the conductor; since medium voltage systems have a smaller load current and reduced voltage drop, the necessity for oversized conductors can be eliminated. 
                                            Utilizing medium voltage power distribution can also reduce the upfront cost of copper conductors and installation as well as the long term operating costs. This method provides the opportunity to move the transformation of load power closer to the load itself to take advantage of the reduced current at higher voltages. Lower current equates to smaller and fewer copper conductors, thus reducing overall costs.
                                            Redundancy and Power Supply Transfer
                                            When it comes to providing power to your Critical Operations system, one of the most important things you need to consider is how to ensure that power is always being consistently supplied. As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the concept of redundancy as a method for maintaining stable power and distributing it appropriately throughout your power system and selecting the appropriate scheme for your facility's needs. In this topic, you will identify redundancy levels.
                                            Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 

                                            In the world of Critical Operations, however, the concept of redundancy is much more multi-faceted than the word ‚Äúextra‚Äù implies. How many components of a system have redundancy? Is it just extra capacity or really extra equipment? Does the extra equipment sit idle in standby, or can it be used for non¬¨critical functions until called upon in the event of a failure? To what extent can a single fault take out the primary component and the redundant component
                                            Redundancy Levels
                                            Most of the Critical Operations industries are converging towards a common language regarding redundancy and the different variations, or levels, of redundancy. This means a facilities technician can walk from a power plant to a data center to a critical manufacturing facility and understand very quickly what equipment is actually being used out on the floor when the operations manager describes the designed redundancy.
                                            Note: Redundancy levels in regard to mechanical and controls systems have essentially the same meaning as they are described here, in terms of power distribution systems.
                                            These various levels of redundancy include the following:
                                            N 
                                            N+1
                                            2N
                                            2(N+1)
                                            N is to redundancy discussions as the variable ‚Äúx‚Äù is to mathematics: a given or basic number of some thing(s). N redundancy means just that: the basic number of some type of device or equipment (be it generators, UPSs, chillers, etc.) required to support and operate the critical infrastructure. 
                                            In this case, the number of items is more limiting than capacity. For instance, an MCO facility that requires 2 MW of power for its critical infrastructure with a single 5 MW generator is only operating at N redundancy; that
                                            Dual-Cord Supply
                                            When you get down to the level of an individual piece of equipment, redundancy can get a bit tricky. Utilizing a dual-cord supply scheme is the most common approach for high-technology equipment and literally refers to plugging that piece of equipment in twice.
                                            Fig. 3.7 - Rack-mounted servers in a data center utilize dual-cord supplies to provide power redundancy.
                                            Fig. 3.7 - Rack-mounted servers in a data center utilize dual-cord supplies to provide power redundancy.
                                            When utilizing dual-cord supply, there is a basic method and a preferred method. In almost any piece of equipment, there is usually an internal power supply of some sort behind the power cord connection that takes the supplied power and converts it to what the machine needs to run on (AC vs. DC, a particular voltage, wattage, etc.). The machine will therefore need two of these. 
                                            The basic method to establish redundancy is to have this configuration and plug both cords into the same supply circuit. The preferred method is for each of these cords to be connected to separate power circuits, so that there is redundancy if the machine's power supply component fails, but also if one of the circuits in an MCO system goes down. 
                                            There are two situations where dual-cord supply is important and therefore often implemented: with medical equipment and data center equipment. Medical equipment tops the list of candidates for dual-cord supply, simply because there may be one or more lives at risk. Not all medical equipment is highly sensitive to losing power for fractions of a second, but if a life-support system or surgical device went offline for even a few seconds or minutes, the results could be deadly. 
                                            Additionally, when it comes to complex modern medical technologies, it's not just about how long power is lost, but whether or not the start-up cycle time for that equipment is lengthy enough to have equally terrible consequences.

                                            When it comes to data center equipment, dual-cord supply is equally important. Computers operate at incredibly high speeds and, in most cases, all outages are therefore equal: it doesn't matter if power was lost for one second or milliseconds. 
                                            Lost data, lost transactions, the risk of fail-over systems not picking up the load are all examples of how millions of dollars can be lost all for the sake of not installing an additional $50 power cord.

                                            Power Supply Transfer
                                            With a strong understanding of the fundamentals of power distribution and redundancy, you can then begin to explore what to do if there is any interruption to the stable power being delivered through the system. In the event of some sort of power outage, having the ability to easily switch between the primary power source and the backup power source is of the utmost importance. 
                                            As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the basics of power supply transfer, including the various components that can be used to perform this important function. In this topic, you will identify the elements of power supply transfer.

                                            Closed Transition Transfer Switch 
                                            Closed transition is a method of switching between two power sources utilizing the ‚Äúmake before break‚Äù method of transfer. A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power. If these conditions are met within tolerances, the switch contacts close or ‚Äúmake‚Äù with a slight overlap for transfer to prevent any interruption of supplied

                                            Click on the following tabs to learn about interlocks:
                                            Critical Power Interlocks
                                            Trapped Key Interlocks
                                            An interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage. This is achieved by utilizing two circuit breakers that are interlocked so that only one can close at a time. In this manner, an interlock system maintains the critical load during a power outage, while prohibiting the circuit breakers from being powered by two different sources at the same time while connecting to the load. 
                                            In the case of an electrical transfer from utility power to generator, the interlock system will enable a safe disconnect from the utility feed to the emergency generator power without the two sources connecting to each other. This separation eliminates the possibility of electrical back feed which can be extremely dangerous to personnel and cause catastrophic damage to critical equipment.
                                            Note: Trapped Key Interlocks are commonly referred to as Kirk Keys. Kirk Keys are a specific brand of trapped key interlocking systems, but having been around for over a century, many Critical Operations personnel have gotten into the habit of referring to all trapped key interlock systems, regardless of manufacturer, as Kirk Keys. 
                                            Power Distribution Topologies
                                            Now that you know about the concepts of redundancy and the components of power distribution and transfer, it's time to think about how all these components go together to provide the necessary redundancy for your Critical Operations system. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it is important for you to understand the concept of a topology and select the appropriate schema that will successfully support your facility in the event of an emergency. In this topic, you will identify the various power distribution topologies. 
                                            Power Distribution Topology
                                            The topology of systems refers to more than just what is in a system: it focuses on how and why things are laid out and connected the way they are. Specific to power distribution, then, this refers to the specific design of the power distribution system, made in such a manner that it offers the most optimal operations. 
                                            With this in mind, a Critical Operations design may include the best equipment available and extra components for redundancy, but the next step in mitigating risk and ensuring reliability is a well-defined topology that takes into consideration more than just a piece of equipment breaking down. 
                                            Redundancy is only one part of topology reliability designs‚Äîwe do want extra equipment, after all. Taking steps to protect parts of systems, or other systems, from nearby faults is how we take steps toward higher and higher levels of reliability. In this vein, there are four different topologies or "tiers" of design that are commonly used in power distribution (and that are applicable to other system designs): basic, redundant, concurrent maintainability, and fault tolerant. For simplicity's sake, we'll look at each of these topologies using a single Critical Operation example utilizing generators and associated generator switchgear for distribution, with a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load.
                                            Note: The Uptime Institute‚Äîa consortium of companies that oversee the education and certification of enterprise data center professionals‚Äîhas perhaps the most well-defined and widely recognized system for design topology analysis. The Tier System they have developed has four levels corresponding to the major levels of reliability: Tier I‚ÄìBasic, Tier II‚ÄìRedundant, Tier III‚ÄìConcurrently Maintainable, and Tier IV‚ÄìFault Tolerant. A full description of the tier classification system, the tier classifications, and the process for site certification analysis is included in an appendix, reprinted with permissio
                                            Basic Topology
                                            Basic topology for the example facility (generators, associated switchgear, and a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load) gives us just enough to keep things running‚Äîperhaps two 2.5 MW generators connected to a single generator switchgear. During a loss of power‚Äîwhile, hopefully, a UPS system is carrying the load‚Äîthe generators fire up and supply the whole power distribution system from a single connection. While this is better than no back up, for sure, a basic topology is just barely an acceptable option.

                                            Redundant Topology
                                            Given the desired level of N + 1 redundancy when the design allows for it at the example critical facility, you would need at least one extra unit beyond N. Redundant topology for this facility would be three 2.5 MW generators sharing a common connection to the generator switchgear. Upon a loss of power, all three generators would come online to power the facility (most likely, but the logic could call for just two, keeping one in ready standby), but a fault on one unit will still leave sufficient capacity to carry all the critical load. In this manner of thinking, a redundant topology is a good option.

                                            Concurrently maintainable topology takes it one step further by adding isolation points around the pieces of equipment in a system with redundancy. As the name implies, this allows for maintenance or repair of equipment without taking the entire system out of service. In the Critical Operation example, each of th
                                            Fault Tolerant Topology
                                            A fault tolerant topology has the most strenuous design considerations put into place; basically referring to a design in which a single fault would not take out an entire system. From a redundancy perspective, we would see 2(N + 1) for all equipment and components in the system. In the Critical Operations example, there would be two sets of three 2.5 MW generators (for a total of six units), with each set having its own separate generator switchgear. The two units would most likely be connected by a normally closed ‚Äútie-breaker‚Äù between them, with the ability to supply the power distribution system from either end. 

                                            Not only does the Critical Operations team benefit from the aspects of concurrent maintainability, any fault (generator failure, switchgear breaker failure, fault on the switchgear, etc.) only takes out one-half of the system, leaving it with a full N + 1 set of equipment available. In this manner of thinking, the fault tolerant topology is the best option.
                                            Electrical Protection
                                            As you start to get further into the design of a system's power distribution scheme‚Äîincluding which critical components will be implemented and how they will be implemented‚Äîyou need to make sure that you have put the proper protections in place to ensure that every component in the electrical system is operating safely. Any amount of electrical voltage could be hazardous to the people or parts in any given facility, but the voltage in a critical facility is exponentially more dangerous. 
                                            As a facility operator, you will need to know what techniques and devices are available to protect your facility's personnel and critical components from dangerous electrical events. In this topic, you will identify and apply electrical protection te
                                            Grounding Electrical Equipment
                                            As you may recall, grounding is the process of removing excess electrical charge from a component or system and distributing it to a larger body capable of receiving that charge. When it comes to your power distribution system, grounding is an extremely important concept, especially due to the higher voltages that you may interact with at this level of the distribution chain. 
                                            In addition to grounding measures in place throughout power distribution systems as a whole, individual electrical equipment should have grounding connections whenever possible to mitigate the risk of damage to the equipment during faults and to disperse any excess charge for personnel safety. In many cases, individual pieces of equipment may be connected directly to those larger facility grounding systems. In this situation, it is imperative that these connections are well-documented and well-designed, so that the pathways of lower electrical potential lead to the ground termination and not back to smaller equipment. 
                                            Equipment may also be grounded locally if need be. For example, a PDU may be located in a hall or closet somewhere between the switchgear and the critical load, but not near the installed grounding system. In this case, the PDU may be grounded to a piece of structural building steel, or just a single copper rod sunk into the subfloor

                                            Over-Current Protection
                                            Fig. 3.14 - In over-current protection, a breaker automatically switches to the off position when the power exceeds the level it can support.
                                            Fig. 3.14 - In over-current protection, a breaker automatically switches to the off position when the power exceeds the level it can support.
                                            Over-current protection is likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with: it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe levels. 
                                            This is most often achieved by a breaker tripping or fuse blowing‚Äîthe exact same thing you've probably experienced in your own home if you overloaded an outlet. A surge of current through the device triggers the interruption, which likely requires a



                                            Fig. 3.13 - A fault tolerant topology.
                                            Over-current protections can be instantaneous or over a predetermined, measured period of time. For example, most motors have a notably higher starting current than running current, so we don't want equipment tripping a breaker just because there are twice as many amps as usual if the motor equipment is shifting. So, on a PDU that is feeding mechanical equipment, the design may call for the PDU to trip breakers instantaneously at one hundred times the running current, or at twenty-five times the running current and sustain it for three seconds. 
                                            Some advanced logic controls may be able to analyze the occurrence and determine if it is safe to close the breaker and rejoin back in to the load, but the majority of Critical Operations personnel prefer to stick with manual resets so that a technician has the chance to troubleshoot the occurrence and make the determination whether or not a dangerous condition still exists.
                                            Protective Relays
                                            Protective relays are electromagnetically or electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions. More simply, these are the mechanical devices that open and close breakers in response to undesirable conditions. 
                                            This is generally the means by which breakers are tripped open during protective features such as over-current. Protective relays may also be controlled by logic as part of a response sequence, closing breakers for alternate source after a primary source is tripped due to a fault condition.
                                            Fig. 3.15 - Protective relays used to provide over-current protection at a power generating station.
                                            Surge Protection
                                            Just like you might have a surge protector at home to protect your electronic devices from harmful spikes in the power supply (typically in the form of a surge-protected power strip), Critical Operations need a form of surge protection to do the same for their critical components. 
                                            A Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) is the industrial equivalent to the surge protector power strip your home electronics are plugged into, and provides electrical protection to connected equipment by buffering and absorbing voltage spikes. There are many variants of TVSS systems available to Critical Operations designers, with a wide range of proprietary technologies (usually to protect specific types of equipment or to mitigate specific types of transients (i.e., momentary changes in the voltage). 
                                            The basic concept of surge protection‚Äîin addition to the specific protections that individual equipment may have‚Äîis to have inline devices throughout the power distribution system that act as energy diverters. When a TVSS module senses a condition for which it is configured, it uses some form of switch to quickly divert part or all of the excess voltage away from the connected load, generally to a ground connection
                                            Lighting Protection
                                            Since critical facilities have a tendency to be very large, often remotely located, they are clearly at higher than average risk for lightning strikes. Lightning protection comes in many forms and is simply a safeguard to Critical Operations from lightning strikes. It can be as simple as a single tower located away from the main facility, or a series of small lightning rods (similar to those found in residential applications) connected to a ground conductor.
                                            TVSS setups are also a form of lightning protection to handle the immense voltages associated with a strike. For Critical Operations installations that may share utility connections with non-critical spaces or other customers (namely, not having their own substation and switchgear with a full set of other protective trips, relays, and interlocks), TVSS should be an important part of the design in regard to lightning protection, as the Critical Operations installation may not have full control of the incoming utility.

                                            Flash Protection
                                            An arc flash is an explosion of heat, light, molten metal, and plasma that results when an electrical connection is made with very little resistance. Most commonly, an arc is the result of a short between phases and or ground connections (imagine what happens when a conductive material falls across two power lines running along the street). You may have experienced a small spark when removing a plug from a power outlet‚Äîthis is a minor arc. `
                                            In Critical Operations, however, you are exposed to much higher electrical energies than in your home, so these arcs become exponentially more powerful and dangerous. Operators and technicians are most exposed to arc flash risks when operating and maintaining switchgear and breakers.

                                            Zone Selective Interlocks
                                            Keeping in mind that electrical energy does not exist as a stationary point in a system but is always moving in some direction (ignoring energy storage devices for the moment), a zone selective interlock is an intelligent control feature that can be added to a protective system in order to prevent the entire system from responding to a fault.
                                             
                                            For example, a ground fault may be sensed on an entire circuit, from the output of a UPS down to a specific piece of equipment; however, the logic-controlled zone selective interlocks will observe the condition and only perform the protective response at the point closest to the fault (furthest downstream, in most cases). This will ideally only trip the breakers nearest the condition‚Äîit wouldn't make sense to shut down the entire electrical lineup if only a single PDU has a fault. 
                                            This particular protection scheme could be designed in a very complex manner depending upon the scale of the critical power distribution system and criticality of connected load, but the underlying principle remains the same: impact the least amount of equipment possible. 
                                            Power Distribution Preventative Measures
                                            Now that you can identify all of the various components of the power distribution system and how to protect them reactively in an emergency event, it is equally important to think about how you can protect them proactively. Preventative maintenance can help ensure that all your critical components are operating safely and effectively, even without the threat of an outage. 

                                            As a facility operator, it is highly likely that your responsibilities will include completing these types of tasks. In this topic, you will identify the preventative maintenance procedures for power distribution components.
                                            Switchgear Maintenance
                                            Switchgear maintenance involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup, exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular equipment installed. It is generally the most complex, comprehensive, and risk-sensitive preventative maintenance procedures that most critical facilities will experience on their support infrastructure (aside from the more complex maintenance of specialized components such as nuclear reactor refueling, bringing down a satellite tower, moving cryogenic R&D equipment, etc.). 
                                            As it is difficult, and often dangerous, to methodically work through fully de¬¨energizing switchgear for personnel safety, this maintenance is typically only done once every few years. Critical Operations managers will take advantage of this rare condition to maintain as many components of this critical component as possible on a tight timeline.
                                            Fig. 3.20 - The switchgear for an electrical main and its associated distribution should be maintained every few years.
                                            Breaker Testing
                                            Breaker testing involves physically inspecting a circuit breaker and subjecting it to as many functional checks as possible. 
                                            This is often accomplished during switchgear maintenance schedules because it is much easier and quicker to remove breakers from de-energized cabinets. One sub¬¨process of breaker testing is injection testing, in which varying levels of voltage, current, and/or resistance are applied to the breaker in order to check that its protective features respond appropriately. 
                                            Coordination Studies
                                            Breaker coordination studies refer to the analysis of installed breakers, their connected loads, and validating or setting their protective features to operate in proper sequencing. 
                                            For example, breakers that are further down a lineup, and therefore closer to connected load, should generally have lower thresholds or tighter tolerances than those upstream. Similar to selective interlock functions, this allows for isolation of faults closest to the condition, affecting fewer adjacent components. 
                                            Coordination studies should be performed during construction, but are unfortunately not regularly updated with the addition of new equipment. Many Critical Operations, therefore, prefer periodic reviews of the power distribution systems to identify any changes and then adjust settings appropriately.
                                            Exercising Generators
                                            Exercising generators refers to a variety of maintenance activities from short weekly run starts, to load bank tests, to full transfer of connected critical load. It is general best practice to exercise generators to at least a nominal extent on a monthly basis. 
                                            This is a hotly debated topic amongst Critical Operations personnel as there is always some risk. An engine could break during an otherwise innocuous test and inadvertently take a backup power supply away from the facility, or the switchgear could hang up during a full load transfer and force the UPSs to carry the load or cause an outage altogether. With proper equipment-level maintenance, these risks can be minimized, but never prevented. The other side of the argument is: if there is going to be a failure, why not have it during a controlled environment, with competent personnel around, and primary power sources still available? 
                                            The main points from this module are as follows:

                                                Power distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source‚Äîeither externally from the utility or internally from generators‚Äîand then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load.
                                                A power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs‚Äî typically in the form of outlets‚Äîdesigned to distribute electrical power to multiple devices.
                                                Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 
                                                A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power.
                                                Soft loading is a method of switching between two power sources where a soft loading transfer switch synchronizes and parallels the two independent power sources without the interruption of power, and then transfers the load between the two as it minimizes the momentary variations in the voltage and frequency.
                                                A static transfer switch (STS) utilizes solid state power electronics and silicone controlled rectifiers to transfer power very rapidly without utilizing slower electromechanical means to transfer the power supply.
                                                A soft loading closed transition switch is often utilized to support an automatic transfer of power while enabling a

                                                An automatic transfer switch (ATS) automatically transfers electrical power from the primary source (via electromechanical means) to an alternate source such as an emergency generator set.
                                                An interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage.
                                                Trapped Key Interlock a key is actually trapped inside a cylinder that is part of the breaker itself.
                                                Over-current protection is likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with: it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe levels.
                                                Protective relays are electromagnetically or electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions.
                                                Switchgear maintenance involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup, exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular equipment installed.

                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                    The main points from this module are:
                                                        Criminal intelligence is information that has been compiled and analysed for the purpose of preventing or monitoring crime.

                                                        Understanding all the available information is crucial for good decision-making using criminal intelligence analysis.

                                                        The collation and assessment of intelligence can be broken down into four stages: collection, evaluation, analysis and actioning.

                                                        There are some key areas in which an analyst is expected to be highly capable, they include critical thinking, multitasking, task management and objective thinking.

                                                        Criminal psychologists assess convicted offenders and provide them with support and treatment.

                                                        Quantitative research handles numbers and statistics, while qualitative research is concerned with personal accounts and meanings.

                                                        Intelligence-led policing is a form of policing that focuses on the prevention of crime over reactive policing.

                                                        The application of intelligence is dependent on the collection of reliable data.

                                                        Technological advancements have helped law enforcement agencies in curbing crimes. Also, they have made criminal organisations more advanced.
                                                        The police force in the UK is broken down into 43 forces with each overseen by three distinct authorities

                                                    Having completed this course, you will be able to:
                                                        Describe the process, rules and techniques involved in the interrogation.
                                                        State the outcomes of the case studies done on the British interrogation system
                                                        Identify the psychological struggle between the suspect and the police during interrogation.
                                                        Distinguish the different tactics used in police interviews and responses of a suspect to the said tactics.
                                                        Recognise the issues related to the interpretation of interview tactics.
                                                        Discuss the significance of confession and the reasons involved in making confessions.
                                                        List the causes for a false confession.
                                                        Define the miscarriage of justice.
                                                        Lesson Summary
                                                        The key contents covered in the module are the following:
                                                            The Reid technique of interrogation construes interrogation as the psychological undoing of deception.
                                                            The tactics of effective interrogation are dependent upon the interrogator coming across as confident and fully knowledgeable about the case.
                                                            The three main ways in which an interrogator confronts a suspect are direct accusation, evidence strategy and supported direct accusation.
                                                            The most common tactic of the interview involves the police officer pointing to a contradiction or an inconsistency in the suspect‚Äôs statement.
                                                            The presence of a solicitor and previous prison experience markedly reduces the likelihood of suspects‚Äô confessing.
                                                            In April 1995, the detainees‚Äô right to silence was modified under sections 34 and 37 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The middle sentence of the current police caution warns of possible adverse inference of the detainees‚Äô right to silence.
                                                            The three categories of interview tactics are delivery, maximisation and manipulation.
                                                            The impact of interview tactics can be determined from the responses of the interviewee and the observations and evaluation of the behavioural symptoms throughout the interview process.

                                                                    Machines are an integral part of modern industry, making work easier for human operators. However, these machines also pose a significant risk to workers if not properly safeguarded. The fast-moving parts, sharp edges, and high-powered mechanisms of machines can cause severe injuries like amputations, lacerations, crushing, abrasions, and even fatalities. This is why machine safeguarding is so important - it ensures that workers can do their jobs safely and helps prevent costly accidents and downtime. To understand how to safeguard machines, let's first understand what exactly machines are and the hazards they can present.
                                                                    What is a machine or machinery?

                                                                    As per ISO 12100, an international standard on machinery safety, a machine is defined as "An assembly fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves and which are joined together for a specific application." 
                                                                    This highlights the fact that the presence of moving parts is the key characteristic that defines a machine, and it is these moving parts that can create the primary hazards.
                                                                    Machinery Hazards
                                                                    Machinery hazards can be grouped into two main categories:
                                                                    Mechanical Hazards
                                                                    Mechanical hazards can come from the movement of various mechanical parts such as gears, moving belts & pulleys, rotating shafts, reciprocating arms, cutting teeth, or any other parts that are in motion. These different types of hazardous mechanical parts are found in various combinations in all machines. 
                                                                    Non-mechanical Hazards
                                                                    Mechanical Hazards
                                                                    There is a risk of injury whenever a machine part moves or has the potential to move. Movements can be reciprocating, sliding/transverse, or rotational. Each form of movement poses a different hazard, including one or more of the following:
                                                                    Abrasion (or Friction)
                                                                    This is the result of friction between a moving part and the skin. The risk increases with the surface's roughness and speed of movement. Even smooth parts can cause abrasion if they are moving at high speeds. The risk may increase if the body part is trapped and unable to escape the hazard.
                                                                    Mechanical Hazards (Cont.)
                                                                    Drawing in (or Trapping)
                                                                    This is caused when a body part is drawn into a 'nip point' of the moving machine parts. The risk is more significant if the surface is rough or has projections, e.g., screws and bolts. The injury may occur as a direct result of the entanglement or as a result of the body part being dragged into an area where further injuries could occur. Anyone with long hair, loose clothing, gloves, a necktie, jewelry, or any of these things is at considerably higher risk.
                                                                    Impact (or Struck by)
                                                                    Non-mechanical Hazards
                                                                    Non-mechanical hazards to be considered from machine safeguarding perspective include:
                                                                    Electrical Hazards
                                                                    Any exposed electrical conductors in a machine may pose a risk of electric shock or electrocution. Additionally, contact with live electrical parts can result in electrical burns.
                                                                    High Temperatures

                                                Non-mechanical Hazards (Cont.)
                                                Hazardous Substances
                                                Workers who operate and maintain machinery can suffer from various adverse health effects besides physical injuries. They can be exposed to certain hazards through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. These hazards can include exposure to toxic chemicals, biological contamination, waste materials, harmful airborne substances, and radiation such as UV light, radio frequencies, and lasers.
                                                Ejected Materials
                                                High Noise Levels
                                                Which one of these is an example of an impact hazard?
                                                Risk Control of Machinery Hazards
                                                To ensure the safe operation of machines, it is necessary to control the risks posed by machinery hazards. Controlling the risks involves identifying the hazards, assessing the risk level presented by each hazard, and implementing suitable control measures. This approach can be implemented at any stage of the machinery's lifespan, from construction to disposal, and should be repeated until the risk is deemed acceptable.
                                                Hazard Identification
                                                Machinery hazards that have not been identified can neither be assessed nor managed. The risk control process, therefore, starts with an inspection of the machine operation and its operating parts to identify the hazards present.  This includes checking for all hazardous conditions and predicting any hazardous events associated with the machine. Using a checklist or template can simplify the process, but hazard identification can effectively be accomplished by following these four steps.
                                                Analysis of operation
                                                Analysis of machine
                                                Analysis of current controls
                                                Machine intervention analysis
                                                This involves observing work activities associated with the machine and recognizing the hazards to which workers may be exposed. In addition to normal operation, these activities may include start-up, shut-down, cleaning, tool changes, common maintenance, etc.
                                                When identifying hazards, it is also essential to consider any past accidents, incidents, or malfunctions, as well as relevant regulations, standards, technical specifications, and safety data sheet
                                                Risk Assessment
                                                After identifying the machinery hazards, the next step is to assess their risk level and prioritize them accordingly. There are a variety of methods for conducting risk assessments, ranging from technical (quantitative risk assessment) to observational (qualitative risk assessment). A simplified model presented here includes elements of both quantitative and qualitative methods and comprises two steps: Risk Estimation and Risk Evaluation.
                                                In risk estimation, the risk level for each hazardous situation is estimated by quantifying the following elements of risk:
                                                A) Severity of harm, which can be determined based on the extent of injury or health damage, such as minor, major, or fatal, and the number of people affected, such as one or multiple.
                                                B) Probability of occurrence, which is determined by the likelihood of a hazardous event happening and the availability of technical and human measures to prevent or mitigate harm.
                                                Risk Assessment (Cont.)
                                                After assigning the appropriate values for severity and probability, the Overall Risk Score (also referred to as the Risk Index Value) is calculated by multiplying the severity and probability values.
                                                Overall Risk Score = Severity x Probability
                                                The overall risk score for each identified hazard is then used to evaluate the level of risk and determine if it is acceptable. If deemed unacceptable, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented.
                                                The scores can also be used to prioritize risks, with higher scores signifying a greater degree of risk requiring more focus and mitigation resources.

                                                You can learn more about the machinery risk assessment procedure by referring to "ISO 12100:2010. standard,  Safety of machinery ‚Äî General principles for design ‚Äî Risk as
                                                Control Measures
                                                If the risk assessment process determines that a reduction in risk is necessary, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented. For selecting control measures, the following hierarchy of controls is used to reduce risk levels.
                                                Inherently Safe Design Measures
                                                Inherently safe design measures involve eliminating hazards or reducing associated risks through the selection of appropriate design features in the machinery. This is the most effective and ideal solution for reducing risk, as design elements that naturally eliminate or reduce hazards are likely to remain effective, whereas other protective measures can sometimes fail or be ignored. There are two approaches to designing machines with inherent safety.
                                                Avoiding or Reducing Hazards
                                                Examples of this approach include:
                                                ‚Äî Reducing the mass, speed, or distances of travel of moving parts.
                                                ‚Äî Ensuring rotating parts have no projections and smooth polished surfaces.
                                                ‚Äî Reducing the sharpness and increasing the corner radii of machinery parts.
                                                ‚Äî Increasing the separation and clearance distances between moving parts.
                                                ‚Äî Filling or reducing the size of gaps to prevent access to crushing or shearing hazards.
                                                ‚Äî Reducing operating temperatures and pressures.
                                                ‚Äî Reducing voltages.
                                                Machine Safeguards
                                                Due to operational limitations, it may not always be possible to reduce risk to an acceptable level by using inherently safe design measures. In such cases, machine safeguards become the next option.
                                                It's common to use the words "safeguard" and "guard" interchangeably, but they have distinct definitions in the field of machinery safety.
                                                What are machine "safeguards"?
                                                The word "safeguards" refers to a collection of protective measures used to keep workers from coming into potentially dangerous contact with machinery hazards Those protective measures can be machine guards or safeguarding devices employed separately or in combination.

                                                Personal protective equipment (PPE) and administrative controls are viewed as last resort for managing risks associated with machinery hazards. They aim to reduce residual risks after higher-level controls, which address the hazard at its source. Also, these controls require substantial efforts and oversight to be effective and potentially less effective than other risk control methods.
                                                Administrative Controls
                                                Administrative controls involve implementing procedures and processes to reduce risk by establishing a set of required actions. This can include placing warning signs on machines, having documented safe operating procedures, training workers, lock-out tag-out machines before interventions, etc. 
                                                Machine Guards
                                                A machine guard is a physical barrier or cover that is designed to prevent access to machinery hazards. There are several types of machine guards, each designed for a specific purpose. General categorization is as follows:
                                                Fixed Guards
                                                These guards are fixed permanently (through welding or riveting) or temporarily (by screws, nuts, etc.) and can only be opened or removed with the use of tools or by destroying the attachment mechanism. There are two basic types:
                                                Enclosing Guards
                                                These guards block access to the danger zone from all sides and cannot be easily removed. However, if frequent access is required, access sections are created along with the use of suitable interlocks. They are typically made from meshed material such as wire mesh, perforated metal, or other similar materials, which allows visibility to the machine. However, if noise, dust, and ejected material protection are also required, solid enclosing guards are used.
                                                Distance Guards
                                                Moveable Guards
                                                The movable guards remain attached to the machine through hinges or slides and can be opened easily without any special tool. There are three basic types:
                                                Adjustable Guards
                                                These guards can be adjusted in position or have sections that can be adjusted in position. These are typically secured with tighteners, like wing nuts, that can be tightened or loosened quickly. Adjustable guards are frequently seen on tools like circular saws and pillar drills; however, their effectiveness depends on the user maintaining the correct guard setting. Because of this, adjustable guards should only be used when a fixed or interlocking guard is not feasible.
                                                Self-adjusting Guards
                                                Interlocking Guards With Guard Locking
                                                For some machinery, the moving parts may have high momentum and take a significant time to stop, or the machine may be programmed to finish a cycle before stopping. In these situations, a standard interlocking guard may not be enough, and a guard-locking feature may be necessary. The guard-locking feature includes a latching device that prevents the guard from being opened until the latch is opened. There are two types:
                                                Interlocking guard with unconditional unlocking
                                                In this case, the operator must unlock the latch before the guard can be opened. This typically requires the operator to activate an ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù control on the machine control panel and provides for a certain time delay between activating the ‚Äústop‚Äù control and opening the guard.
                                                Other Types
                                                Interlocking Guards With Trapped Key
                                                Trapped key interlocking guards ensure that the guard is always closed and locked before the machine can be activated. They work by using a key system to control access to the dangerous parts of the machine and to activate its start function. The key must be inserted into the guard control in order to open the guard and gain access to the dangerous parts. Once the guard is open, the key is trapped in the guard control and cannot be removed until the guard is closed and locked again. Similarly, the same key must be inserted into the start control in order to activate the machine, and it is trapped in the control until the machine is stopped.
                                                Interlocking Control Guards
                                                Note: If there is a possibility that someone could become trapped inside the guarded area, then it is nece
                                                Machine Guards Design Requirements
                                                When determining the appropriate design and type of machine guards, a comprehensive evaluation of all foreseeable aspects of the machinery's environment and operation during its expected lifespan is crucial. This includes considering the potential dangers posed by the various hazards present and the groups of individuals who may be exposed to these hazards. Inadequate evaluation of these aspects can lead to hazardous situations, such as individuals being able to bypass the guards and exposing themselves to danger.

                                                The aspects to take into account include the following:

                                                    Machine aspects
                                                    Human aspects
                                                    Materials of construction
                                                    Shape and installation aspects

                                                Let's delve into the elements that should be considered for each aspect.
                                                Machine Aspects
                                                Access to dangerous parts of the machine
                                                Machine guards should be designed in a way that doesn't require opening or removing them to make adjustments, lubrication, and routine maintenance of the machine. This can be achieved by installing multiple smaller guards that prevent access to dangerous parts while allowing access to safe parts. Also, small access holes can be provided for screwdrivers, test probes, etc. 
                                                Ejected materials and hazardous substances
                                                Noise Level
                                                Radiation
                                                Explosive atmosphere
                                                ssary to have a presence-sensing device and emergency stop feature available inside the area.
                                                Interlocking Devices
                                                Interlocking devices aim to stop a machine's hazardous operations under a specific condition, such as by opening a machine guard. These devices monitor the guard's position and send a stop command if it's not closed. They can also control other functions, like applying a brake to stop hazardous machine operations before access is allowed. 
                                                There are various types, but they mainly fall into two categories based on their actuation principle:
                                                1. Mechanically activated devices
                                                The principle of working for these types of devices is based on physical contact, force, or pressure. They use switching cams, turning levers, or hinges to activate or deactivate the machine. To increase safety, some of these devices may be coded, which means that they can only be operated with a specific actuator, such as a key or a specific shape. 
                                                2. Non-mechanically activated devices
                                                Interlocking Device Examples
                                                Linear Cam-operated Position Detector
                                                This type uses a linear cam to open or close a control circuit by means of an actuator & position detector. It is commonly used on sliding guards to detect when the guard is opened or closed. The linear cam is connected to the sliding guard, and when the guard is opened, it forces the actuator down, which in turn opens the control circuit contacts and deactivates the machinery. 
                                                Rotary Cam-operated Position Detector
                                                Tongue-operated Interlocking Device
                                                Examples of interlocking devices are shown on the following pages.
                                                Interlocking Device Examples (Cont.)
                                                Lever-operated Interlocking Device
                                                In this type, an open guard physically blocks the start/stop lever, preventing it from being lifted to start the machine. The machine may be started once the guard is closed, enabling the lever to be lifted.
                                                Captive-key interlocking Device
                                                Non-contact interlocking Devices
                                                Mode of Actuation
                                                Mode of actuation refers to the method or mechanism by which a device is activated or triggered to operate. Selecting the appropriate mode of actuation is crucial for interlocking devices to minimize the risk of manipulation. Mechanically activated interlocks can be triggered in two ways: positive-mode actuation and negative-mode actuation.
                                                Positive-mode Actuation
                                                Negative-mode Actuation
                                                This actuation works by keeping the plunger of the interlocking device pressed down by a cam, resulting in an open circuit as long as the guard stays open. Once the guard is fully closed, a spring moves the plunger back, completing the circuit. In case of a fault, such as the spring failure, the device will fail to a safe condition, and the machine will not operate.
                                                Positive-mode actuation is more reliable than negative mode. Therefore, when a guard employs a single mechanical interlock, it should utilize positive-mode actuation. Interlocks with negative-mode actuation should only be used in combination with additional positive-mode actuators on the same guard.

                                                Interlocking System Failures
                                                Even though interlocking systems effectively prevent access to dangerous parts, injuries still happen on machines with these types of systems. The reasons for failure can be divided into two categories:
                                                Interlock Malfunction
                                                Commonly occurring faults with interlock systems can include misaligned parts, sticking of moving parts, poor electrical connections, short-circuiting, spring fractures, and corrosion. These faults are often caused by vibration, wear, and the accumulation of dust and liquids that have not been adequately addressed in the design or by routine maintenance.
                                                Interlock Defeat
                                                How to Avoid Interlock Failures?
                                                Ensuring safe operation and preventing interlock failures requires the use of reliable, high-quality, and high safety-rated devices that are difficult to bypass. Additionally, the following suggestions can be implemented to avoid failures:
                                                Avoiding Interlock Malfunction
                                                Interlock malfunction can be prevented or reduced by:
                                                ‚Äî Choosing an interlocking system with high reliability of control system; 
                                                ‚Äî Installing interlocks securely, so they do not move during use and do not come loose;
                                                ‚Äî Protecting components and wiring from physical damage;
                                                ‚Äî If using mechanically activated interlocks, choose those with positive-mode actuation;
                                                ‚Äî Preventing the use of interlock devices as the standard machine stop;
                                                ‚Äî Ensuring regular maintenance, testing, and training of personnel.
                                                Avoiding Interlock Defeat
                                                Presence Sensing Devices
                                                Presence Sensing Devices (also known as Trip Devices) do not restrict access to the danger zone but rather stop the movement of potentially hazardous parts before contact. While these devices offer adequate protection, they are unsuitable in situations where the ejection of machine parts or materials is possible or containment of dangerous emissions (e.g., noise, dust) is necessary. Additionally, if the machine has a slow or inconsistent stop time or is unable to stop mid-cycle during operation, these devices are also inappropriate.
                                                The main types of presence-sensing devices are:

                                                    Light Curtains
                                                    Area Scanning Devices
                                                    Pressure Mats
                                                    Pressure Sensitive Edges and Bars
                                                    Trip Switches
                                                    Light Curtains
                                                    Light curtains (also called light guards) are electronic devices that consist of a light emitter and a light receiver. The emitter transmits visible or invisible (such as infrared) light beams, and the receiver detects them. If any of the light beams is blocked, the machine stops. 
                                                    Advantages
                                                    Limitations
                                                    Installation
                                                    Light curtains minimize the requirement for interlocking guards and give nearly transparent access to machinery. This is especially advantageous for automated machinery moving bulk goods or machinery where regular access for loading or unloading is required.
                                                    Area Scanning Devices
                                                    Area scanning devices use harmless electromagnetic radiation, usually laser beams, to detect movement or changes within the defined area. When a movement or change is detected, it sends a stop signal to the machine and shuts it down. 
                                                    Advantages
                                                    Limitations
                                                    Installation
                                                    Laser scanning devices typically have a fast response time and can quickly detect objects and shut down machinery. They can cover a wide area, making them useful for protecting large machines or multiple machines at once. Their applications include detecting personnel in front of unmanned guided vehicles and within perimeter guards, e.g., in robotic machine enclosures.
                                                    Pressure-sensitive Safety Mats
                                                    Pressure-sensitive safety mats detect the presence of an object or person on a specific surface. These mats usually have pressure-sensitive switches or sensors built into them, which stop the machine when someone steps on them to reach the danger zone.
                                                    Advantages
                                                    Limitations
                                                    Installation
                                                    Pressure-sensitive safety mats are usually cost-effective, easy to install, and can be integrated with other safety systems for added protection. Also, they can be used to cover any shaped or sized surface and provide a fast response when pressure is applied to them.
                                                    Pressure Sensitive Edges and Bars
                                                    Pressure-sensitive edges and bars are mechanically actuated trip devices that stop the machine if subject to a small actuating force. The most widely used type of these devices is a rubber bar that has two conductive strips embedded in it. When pressure is applied to the rubber bar, it causes the strips to come into contact with each other, which generates a stop signal and shuts down the machinery.

                                                    Pressure-sensitive edges and bars can be used to safeguard machinery when there is a potential for entanglement. These devices offer continuous presence detection along surfaces and shut down machinery if a person is captured and pulled onto the sensitive edge. They can also be used between powered closing doors (e.g., subway train doors and elevator doors) and as bumper guards on the front of automatic power trucks.

                                                Trip Switches
                                                Trip switches are devices designed to stop a machine if a minimal amount deflects them. They can be used to prevent serious injury by stopping the machine if a person or object comes into contact with a dangerous part. 
                                                Advantages
                                                Limitations
                                                Installation
                                                On specific machines, such as pillar and radial drills, where installing guards is not feasible, protection can be achieved through the use of trip switches. They can be an effective and simple safety measure for preventing severe injuries on machines where a hand or arm contact can be made with the actua
                                                General Considerations
                                                In all cases, the presence sensing devices should have a suitable maximum response time that has been tested and is not affected by environmental conditions. Their placement should consider a person's approach speed and the total response time to shut down the machine. This can make using presence-sensing devices challenging on some machines. However, when using these devices (e.g., pressure mats, area scanning devices) solely for hazardous start-up prevention, stopping time is not a concern.
                                                Presence-sensing devices must also:

                                                    Have an appropriate performance level (PL) and is reliable for its function.
                                                    Remove any stored energy from the access area of the machine.
                                                    Not to be used for regular stopping or starting the machine. 
                                                    Have a visible indication showing that the device is operating.
                                                    Require manual reset after activation.
                                                    Tested and maintained regularly to ensure proper functioning. and must not fail to danger.

                                                What is meant by performance level (PL)?
                                                Protective Devices
                                                In some cases, it may be necessary to perform maintenance or repairs on a machine while the guarding interlocks are disabled. These kinds of interventions are extremely risky and should be avoided if at all possible. Additional control measures, usually involving the use of protective devices, are required if the suspension of interlocks cannot be avoided. Protective devices allow machine parts to move but in a way that reduces the risk to the machine operator. Also, protective devices can offer some degree of protection if a machine is difficult to guard due to its operational requirements. There are two basic approaches:
                                                1. Reduce access to the danger zone
                                                This is achieved using Two-Hand Devices and/
                                                Two-hand Controls
                                                Two-hand control devices require an operator to use both hands simultaneously to actuate two separate controls to start a machine. This functionality is typically applied where the operator needs to be very close to the machine and could place his other hand in the danger zone if it was a one-handed control.
                                                Advantages
                                                Limitations
                                                Installation
                                                Two-hand controls are an option for machinery that is otherwise hard to guard (e.g., machines having feed and removal processes). This protective device forces the operator to remain in a designated safe area while operating the machine. The operator must keep both controls engaged to activate the machinery; if one control is released, the machine will stop.
                                                or Hold-to-Run Devices. These devices allow machine parts to move but only while control is being operated by someone who is a safe distance away from the danger zone.
                                                Hold-to-run Controls
                                                Devices with hold-to-run operation require an operator to continuously actuate a control to initiate and maintain the operation of the machine. The control can be in the form of a button or lever, which upon release, stops the machine.
                                                Advantages
                                                Limitations
                                                Installation
                                                Hold-to-run controls are typically installed at a safe distance from hazardous areas. These devices require the operator to be positioned away from the danger zone in order to operate the machine by continuously pressing the control. Hold-to-run controls are also used on small power tools such as portable drill machines, where they function as an emergency stop mechanism rather than providing safety by distance.
                                                2. Reduce the hazard in the danger zone
                                                Safe Distance Calculation
                                                A protective device's effectiveness depends on its location being far enough from the machine's danger zone. This is because moving parts of the machine do not come to an immediate stop, and if someone can reach the danger zone before the machine stops, it could result in injury.
                                                Safe Distance (S)
                                                Approach Speed (K)
                                                Total Stopping Time (T)
                                                Additional Distance (C)
                                                The safe distance to install protective devices "S" can be derived using the following formula, as specified by "ISO 13855:2010 Safety of machinery ‚Äî Positioning of safeguards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body".
                                                S = (K x T) + C
                                                The same formula can also be applied to other types of safeguards, including interlocked guards, light curtains, pressure-sensitive mats, area scanning devices, etc.
                                                Limited Operation Devices
                                                Limited operation devices reduce the inherent hazard in the machine by reducing the speed, or range of movement, of machine parts. While this is beneficial, the risk can rarely be reduced to such a low level that access to the moving parts can be acceptable. Usually, access still needs to be prevented, and because these devices do not prevent access, additional functionality (e.g., hold-to-run or two-hand devices) needs to be provided.
                                                Speed Limiting Devices
                                                These devices provide workers with additional time to avoid an accident by reducing the movement speed of potentially dangerous parts. This feature is useful during machine maintenance or adjustments, promoting a controlled machinery operation. Some machines include a built-in speed limiter that an authorized user with a key or combination can activate.
                                                Movement Limiting Devices
                                                Emergency Stop Systems
                                                An emergency condition in a machine can arise unexpectedly and requires immediate action to prevent injury or damage. Emergency stop systems, also known as E-stops, provide a means for quickly shutting down machinery or equipment in the event of an emergency. 
                                                Advantages
                                                Limitations
                                                Installation
                                                When an emergency occurs, it is usually because of something that was not anticipated during the design stage of the machinery. Thus there may not be any built-in features or safeguards to mitigate its effects. In this situation, emergency stop devices provide a means for stopping the machinery in a safe and controlled manner.
                                                Lesson Summary

                                                    Machines are defined by the presence of moving parts, which can include reciprocating, sliding/transverse, and rotational movements.
                                                    The hazards posed by moving parts can include abrasion, cutting, crushing, drawn-in, impact, stabbing, and shearing. Non-mechanical hazards can include exposure to live electrical parts, hot surfaces, high noise levels, hazardous substances, ejected materials, and stored energy.
                                                    To control the risks posed by machinery hazards, it is necessary to identify the hazards, assess their risk level, and implement suitable control measures.
                                                    Machinery hazards can be identified through analysis of operation, analysis of the machine, analysis of current controls, and machine intervention analysis.
                                                    The overall risk score for each hazard is calculated by considering the severity of harm and probability of occurrence, which is then used to evaluate the level of risk and determine if it is acceptable. If the risk is deemed unacceptable, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented.
                                                    The hierarchy of controls is used to select the most appropriate control measures, with the first priority being to reduce hazards through inherently safe machine design. Other options include the use of safeguards, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE).
                                                    Safeguarding methods can include the use of machine guards and/or safeguarding devices

                                                Transport Management System (TMS) - A Transportation Management System (TMS) is a subset of Supply Chain Management (SCM) that deals with the planning, execution and optimization of the physical movement of goods.

                                                TMS is a platform that is designed to streamline the shipping process. It is offered as a module within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and SCM suites that help organizations move inbound ‚Äì procurement ‚Äì and outbound ‚Äì shipment ‚Äì freight using tools like route planning and optimization, yard management, carrier management, etc.
                                                TMS handles four important operations of transport management:

                                                By the end of this module, you will be able to:

                                                    Define electrolysis and redox reactions

                                                    Redox Reactions
                                                    Redox reactions are oxidation-reduction reactions in which electrons transfer between reactants.
                                                    During redox reactions, one of the reactants oxidises (it loses electrons), and the other is reduced (it gains electrons).
                                                    Another, more specific definition of redox reactions involves the transfer of oxygen and hydrogen between chemical species. The following are some examples of redox reactions:
                                                    Iron rusts, forming iron oxides.
                                                    Iron rusts, forming iron oxides.
                                                        Metal corrosion (iron rust) is caused by oxygen in water, oxidising iron into oxides.
                                                        Combustion reactions: The combustion reactions are redox reactions in which hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water.
                                                        Respiration: Redox reactions convert the food we consume into energy.
                                                        Photosynthesis: The reaction between water and carbon dioxide to give glucose and oxygen is a redox reaction in which water becomes oxidised, and carbon dioxide becomes reduced.
                                                    Usually, metals to the left of the periodic table oxidise by losing electrons, and nonmetals to the right reduce by gaining

                                                    Remember that oxidation makes the oxidation number more positive, whereas reduction makes it less positive or more negative.

                                                Redox Equilibrium
                                                When we submerge a copper rod in an aqueous solution of copper sulfate, a dynamic equilibrium is established in which the copper metal oxidises to copper ions, and some ions are reduced to metal copper.
                                                Oxidation reaction
                                                Copper metal is oxidised to copper ions.
                                                                    Cu(s) ‚Üí Cu2+ + 2e‚àí
                                                Reduction reaction
                                                Copper ions are reduced to copper metal.
                                                                    Cu2+ + 2e‚àí ‚Üí Cu(s)
                                                There is an equilibrium between the oxidation and reduction reactions. We can write the oxidation-reduction reaction as follows:
                                                                    Cu2+ (aq) + 2e‚àí ‚áå Cu (s)
                                                Even though the Cu2+/Cu redox reaction is at equilibrium, the equilibrium is shifted more to the right when compared to reactive metals. Copper is an unreactive metal at the bottom of the electrochemical series; it easily gains electrons and reduces to copper metal.
                                                An equilibrium redox reaction occurs between the copper metal and Cu¬≤‚Å∫ ions.

                                                The Opposite Happens With Active Metals
                                                When a zinc rod is submerged in an aqueous zinc sulfate solution, zinc metal loses electrons and converts to zinc ions; at the same time, zinc ions gain electrons and convert to zinc metal.

                                                A conductive electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution is called a half-cell. For example, a copper electrode immersed in a copper sulfate solution is a half-cell.
                                                We write the half-cell as Cu2+/Cu.
                                                In the half-cell, a difference in potential develops at the interface between the copper ions and copper metal because of the difference in the oxidation states between the electrode and electrolyte; we call it ‚Äúthe electrode potential.‚Äù
                                                ‚óè The voltage measured under standard conditions for a half-cell using a standard hydrogen electrode is called the ‚Äústandard electrode potential‚Äù. It has the symbol EÍùä (spoken of as E standard).

                                                Standard Electrode Potential of Some Half-Cells
                                                Here are some examples of standard electrode potentials under standard conditions.
                                                The positive voltage indicates that species are easily reduced, and the negative voltage means that species are easily oxidised.

                                                    The more negative the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is oxidised (the equilibrium lies further to the left).
                                                    The more positive the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is reduced (the equilibrium lies further to the right).

                                                Notice that we consider the metals at the top of the reactivity series to be good reducing agents. This is because they

                                                Why don‚Äôt we measure the electrode potential directly without using a reference electrode?
                                                We use a reference electrode (for example, a standard hydrogen electrode with a known potential) to measure the electrode potential of a half-cell. It is not possible to measure the electrode potential directly due to double-layer formation.

                                                The double layer is a layer that forms when a metal electrode is dipped in an electrolyte; for example, a zinc electrode in a zinc sulfate electrolyte. Zinc tends to be oxidised to Zn2+ ions. As a result, the formed zinc ions move into the solution, causing the accumulation of electrons on the surface of the zinc electrode. The accumulated layer of electrons attracts Zn2+ ions in the solution, leaving another layer of positive ions near the surface of the electrode.

                                                The Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)
                                                We mentioned that we could measure the electrode potential of an electric cell in relation to a standard electrode with a known potential. One of the most commonly used standard electrodes is the standard hydrogen electrode (H+/¬ΩH2) or (2H+/H2).
                                                Standard hydrogen electrode components:
                                                - Platinum electrode coated with a platinum black (finely divided platinum) coating.
                                                - Sulfuric solution, diluted (1.00 mol dm-3).
                                                - Hydrogen gas supply at one atmospheric pressure.
                                                The standard hydrogen electrode has zero electrode potential.

                                                Copper electrochemical half-cell Cu2+/Cu
                                                To measure the copper electrode potential at standard conditions (Eœ¥) (E standard), we prepare a copper half-cell and then connect it to a standard electrode with a known potential (for example, a standard hydrogen electrode).
                                                A copper half-cell consists of a pure copper rod dipped in a 1.00 mol dm-3 copper salt solution (usually copper sulfate) at 25oC.
                                                The copper half-cell is connected to the standard hydrogen electrode in the air using a wire and in solution using a salt bridge.

                                                When we write the equation, we always write the species with a higher oxidation number, Cu2+, to the left.

                                                The zinc electrochemical cell is prepared similarly to the copper electrochemical cell by dipping a pure zinc rod in a 1.00 mol dm-3 zinc salt solution (for example, zinc sulfate) at 25oC.

                                                Notice zinc is more reactive than hydrogen; zinc is more likely to lose electrons and oxidise to zinc ions (negative electrode potential).

                                                Non-metal/Non-metal Ion Half-Cell
                                                A non-metal/ non-metal ion half-cell consists of an electrolyte containing non-metal ions that are reduced to gas. The half-cell electrode is made of platinum rod or foil because it is a conductive and inert metal that does not take part in the reactions.
                                                Let's consider the following example to understand how we can measure the electrode potential of a non-metal/non-metal ion half-cell.
                                                Measuring the electrode potential of Cl2/Cl‚àí half-cell

                                                The Cl2/Cl‚àí half-cell is prepared by bubbling chlorine gas over a platinum electrode immersed in an electrolyte that contains 1.00 mol dm-3 chlorine ions. When we connect the Cl2/Cl‚àí half-cell to the standard hydrogen electrode, the Cl2 gas tends to be reduced to Cl‚àí.
                                                The Cl2/Cl‚àí half-cell:
                                                ¬Ω Cl2(g) + e‚àí ‚áã Cl‚àí(aq)               EÍùä= +1.36 V
                                                Cl2 molecules tend to be reduced to Cl‚àí ions (gain electrons). Electrons move from the hydrogen half-cell to the Cl2/Cl‚àí half-cell. The positive EÍùä value indicates that chlorine has a greater tendency than hydrogen to be reduced

                                                Similar to the chlorine half-cell, we can measure the electrode potential for another non-metal, such as sulfur.
                                                The S2-/S half-cell consists of a solution containing 1.00 mol dm-3 of sulfide ions (S2‚Äì ), and the electrode is platinum.
                                                Reactions at the S2-/S half-cell:
                                                S + 2e‚Äì ‚áã S2‚Äì         EÍùä= ‚àí0.51V
                                                Notice that the S2-/S half-cell has EÍùä equal to ‚àí0.51V. As a result, sulfide ions (anions) lose electrons, forming a solid sulfur precipitate.
                                                The S2-/S half-cell is connected to the standard hydrogen electrode.
                                                Ion/Ion Half-Cell
                                                The ion/ion half-cells contain ions of the same element in different oxidation states.
                                                1. Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cells

                                                Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell contains an equal concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions in 1.00 mol dm‚àí3 solutions. To measure the electrode potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell, we connect it to a standard hydrogen electrode.
                                                The Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell equation is:
                                                        Fe3+(aq) + e‚àí ‚áã Fe2+(aq)          EÍùä= + 0.77 V

                                                 2. MnO4‚Äì/Mn2+ half-cellAnother example of an ion/ion half-cell is MnO4‚Äì/Mn2+ half-cell. The half-cell contains several ionic species. When the half-cell is connected to the standard hydrogen electrode, the reaction at the MnO4‚Äì/Mn2+ half-cell is
                                                                                     MnO4‚Äì(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e‚Äì ‚áã Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)        EÍùä= + 1.52 V
                                                The electrode potential of MnO4‚Äì/Mn2+ half-cell is +1.52 V.

                                                3. VO2+ / V3+ half-cellIn the VO2+ / V3+ half-cell, three species are present: VO2+, V3+ and H+ in 1.00 mol dm-3 solutions. The VO2+ / V3+ half-cell reaction is:
                                                                                                  VO2+ + 2H+ + e‚Äì ‚áã V3+ + H2O           EÍùä= + 0.34 V

                                                    Nernst equation
                                                    We discussed earlier the electrode potential of cells under standard conditions (temperature is 25oC and concentration is 1.00 mol dm‚àí3). The German scientist Walther Nernst developed an equation to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions (at any given temperature or concentration).
                                                    Nernst equation formula:
                                                    Where
                                                    E is the electrode potential under non-standard conditions.
                                                    EÍùã is the electrode potential under standard conditions.
                                                    R is the gas constant, 8.314 JK‚àí1mol‚àí1.
                                                    T is the temperature in Kelvin.
                                                    z is the number of electrons.
                                                    F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol‚àí1).
                                                    [oxidised form] and [reduced form] are concentrations of oxidised and reduced forms
                                                    Nernst formula at 25oC
                                                    If we substitute the RT/F with their values at 25oC and convert ln to log10, the formula becomes:
                                                    The value 0.059 which replaced RT/F is obtained by substituting the values with R = 8.314 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1, T = 298 Kelvin, F = 96,500 C mol‚àí1, and multiplying by 2.303 to convert ln (x) to log10 (x).
                                                    (ln(x)= 2.303 log10 x)
                                                    Nernst formula for cells containing solids
                                                    The concentration of solids doesn‚Äôt change; therefore, at 25oC, the Nernst equation can be simplified to:

                                                    Determining the Feasibility of a Reaction
                                                    In the previous module, we studied how to predict the feasibility of a reaction based on the difference between the two half-cells being greater than 0.30 volts. Sometimes, even though the cell voltage is greater than the mentioned value, the reaction is too slow to be considered feasible.
                                                    Consider the following example of the reaction between the two half cells, 2H+/H2 and Zn2+/Zn.
                                                                                            2H+(aq) + 2e‚àí ‚áå H2(g)                        Eœ¥ = 0.00 V
                                                                                            Zn2+ (aq) + 2e‚àí ‚áå Zn(s)                      Eœ¥ = ‚àí0.76 V
                                                    The voltage of the cell = 0.00 ‚àí (‚àí0.76) = 0.76 V.
                                                    Although theoretically, the cell voltage is greater than 0.30 volts, zinc is considered to lack reactivity when placed in water; the reaction is too slow to be considered.
                                                    Another consideration is the difference between industrial and standard conditions. A large deviation from standard conditions can prevent the reaction from occurring.
                                                    In industry, the rate of a reaction is more crucial than Eœ¥ prediction of the reaction‚Äôs feasibility. The rate of a reaction can be increased by raising the temperature, pressure (for gaseous reactants), reactant concentration (for dissolved reactants), surface area (for solid reactants), or by adding a catalyst.
                                                    oC that has a concentration of 0.003 mol dm‚àí3 (the standard electrode potential of Ag(s)/Ag+(aq) electrode is +0.80 V).

                                                Based on Legislation in Section 13 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                                                Every employee has the right to be kept informed.

                                                The employer must ensure that the employee knows the health and safety risks associated with any job being done, anything being produced, processed, utilized, stored, handled, or transported, and any equipment or machinery being used.

                                                The employer must then offer information on how to take precautions against these threats.
                                                Occupational Health & Safety Act
                                                Based on Legislation in Section 8 of the OHS Act
                                                Based on Legislation in Section 15 of the OHS Act
                                                No employee may knowingly or carelessly meddle with, damage, or abuse health and safety equipment.
                                                This comprises safety and personal protection equipment, as well as firefighting equipment.

                                                An employee who violates a provision of the OHS Act may face legal action.
                                                They may face a fine, punishment, or even incarceration. (A maximum fine of R 50 000 or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months, or both such fine and imprisonment)
                                                Workman's Compensation Procedures

                                                    After an injury or accident, the employer must compensate 75% of the worker's salary for up to three months. The employer will receive this money back once the Compensation Fund begins compensating the worker.
                                                    All businesses are required to pay an annual assessment fee after registering with the Compensation Fund depending on their employees' salaries and the risks connected with the type of job performed.

                                                Workman's Compensation
                                                The COIDA was amended in 1997, Act No 61 of 1997. Unlike the old Workmen's Compensation Act, COIDA covers most employees, not only those who earn less than a certain amount. 
                                                Workers who are injured on duty or have an occupational disease can claim compensation for permanent or temporary disablement.
                                                All employers, as per the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act No 61 of 1997 (COIDA), must register for worker's compensation. Any employer who fails to do this is guilty of a criminal offence.
                                                How Do I Claim Workman‚Äôs Compensation in South Africa?

                                                Inform your immediate boss or employer (verbally or in writing). Make a list of everyone who saw the accident. WCL 2: Notice of Accident and Claim for Compensation is the form that must be filled out.
                                                Observing Task Performance
                                                When determining if something is a physical hazard, consider whether physical harm to an employee could occur.
                                                Everyday workplace objects, such as flammable items or objects that may violently react to other environmental factors, could be included.
                                                What is the Risk of Equipment?

                                                Assess and consider the equipment workers use and how it is used, particularly non-mechanical hazards. 
                                                Equipment and machinery associated with this include contained fluids or gas under pressure, harmful emissions, chemicals and chemical by-products, noise and electricity; if not adequately controlled, it could cause serious harm.
                                                Assessing the Risks of Equipment
                                                Identify, analyze, and mitigate potential hazards and associated risks by conducting risk assessments.
                                                Design and Layout of the Work Area
                                                The work area's layout will determine the employees' safety and efficiency.
                                                 The layout and design of a workspace will determine the flow of people, materials, and equipment.
                                                Look at the arrangement of the equipment and other resources in a facility that can significantly affect efficiency and productivity.
                                                Poor design can be costly, resulting in wasted time, energy, and effort. Worse, a poor layout can significantly increase the hazards in a work area.
                                                Personal Protective Equipment
                                                Gloves, safety goggles, safety shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, vests, and full-body suits are examples of personal protection equipment.
                                                Safety gear is crucial in the workplace because it shields wearers from safety hazards and potential health. It is also known as PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), and it guarantees a secure, enjoyable working environment for everyone by reducing the potential of accidents, illnesses, and legal problems. 
                                                PPE Training
                                                Employers are obligated to supply PPE at no cost to employees where it is necessary to safeguard workers.
                                                Employees who must wear PPE must get training to understand the following:

                                                    When is PPE required?
                                                    What kind of PPE is required?
                                                    How to put on, take off, adjust, and wear anything properly.
                                                    PPE's limitations.
                                                    Upkeep, usefulness, and proper disposal.

                                                Head Protection (Hard Hats )

                                                    A strong, protective shell that deflects and resists head trauma.
                                                    The hat's internal suspension mechanism serves as a shock absorber.
                                                    Some hats act as electrical shock isolators.
                                                    Protects from splashes, spills, and drips for your head, face, neck, and shoulders.
                                                    By altering them, you may add face shields, goggles, hoods, or hearing protection to several hat

                                                Fighting Fire
                                                Fire extinguishers come in a variety of designs to combat various fire classes. The following are the top three categories of fire extinguishers:
                                                Water (APW) Fire Extinguishers
                                                Large, silver fire extinguishers that are 11 kilograms in weight when full and stand 600 millimeters tall.
                                                APW is an abbreviation for "Air-Pressurized Water."

                                                They are simply big squirt cannons filled with regular tap water and pressured air.
                                                Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguishers
                                                Class A Fires
                                                APWs are designed for Class A fires only: Wood, paper, cloth.
                                                APWs are designed for Class A fires only: Wood, paper, cloth.
                                                APWs will be found in older buildings, particularly in public hallways.
                                                 
                                                They will also be found in computer laboratories. It is important to remember, however, that computer equipment must be disconnected from its electrical source before using a water extinguisher on it.
                                                Using water on a flammable liquid fire could cause the fire to spread.
                                                Using water on an electrical fire increases the risk of electrocution. If you have no choice but to use an APW on an electrical fire, make sure the electrical equipment is unplugged or de-energized.
                                                Class B and C Fires
                                                CO2s will frequently be found in the following locations:

                                                    Laboratories
                                                    Mechanical Rooms
                                                    Kitchens
                                                    Flammable Liquid Storage Areas

                                                CO2s are designed for Class B and Class C (Flammable Liquids and Electrical Sources) fires only!
                                                CO2s are designed for Class B and Class C (Flammable Liquids and Electrical Sources) fires only!

                                                By FPASA (Fire Protection Association of South Africa) regulations (and manufacturers‚Äô recommendations), every five years all CO2 extinguishers must undergo hydrostatic testing and recharge.
                                                Fire Triangle CO2
                                                CO2 is very cold as it comes out of the extinguisher, so it cools the fuel as well.
                                                CO2 is very cold as it comes out of the extinguisher, so it cools the fuel as well.

                                                A non-flammable gas called carbon dioxide eliminates the oxygen component of the fire triangle. There is no fire if there is no oxygen.
                                                CO2 could not be able to displace enough oxygen to effectively put out a Class A fire, making it ineffectual at doing so.

                                                Additionally, Class A materials might smoulder and re-ignite. On a Class A fire, never use a CO2 extinguisher.
                                                All Fire Classes

                                                Class B and C dry chemical extinguishers with powder ("BC" extinguishers) may be found in locations like commercial kitchens and spaces containing flammable liquids.
                                                The public halls of new buildings, labs, break rooms, offices, chemical storage spaces, mechanical rooms, cars, underground mining sites, etc., are typical places where ABCs can be found. 

                                                Knowing what kinds of dry chemical extinguishers are available in your region is crucial.
                                                You don't want to accidentally put out a Class A fire with a "BC" extinguisher by mistaking it for an "ABC" extinguisher.
                                                An ‚ÄúABC‚Äù extinguisher will have a label like this, indicating it may be used on Class A, B and C fires.
                                                An ‚ÄúABC‚Äù extinguisher will have a label like this, indicating it may be used on Class A, B and C fire
                                                How To Use a Fire Extinguisher

                                                If you can recall the acronym PASS, using a fire extinguisher will be simple.
                                                Pull the pin
                                                Aim at the base of the fire
                                                Squeeze the top handle
                                                Sweep from side to side



                                                You may use this to discharge the fire extinguisher.
                                                Rules for Fighting Fires

                                                Fires may be quite dangerous; therefore, you should always be assured that putting out a fire won't put you or anybody else at risk.
                                                For this reason, when a fire is discovered:

                                                    If you can do so without putting your safety at risk, help anyone who is in imminent danger get to safety.
                                                    Set off the fire alarm in the building. The Surface Fire Fighting Team and other building occupants will be alerted by the fire alarm.
                                                    You can try using an extinguisher to put out a tiny fire (but only after doing these two s

                                                The Final Rule

                                                The last guideline is that before using an extinguisher to put out a fire, you should always stand with an exit or other means of escape at your back.
                                                You need to be able to exit swiftly in case the extinguisher breaks down or anything unforeseen occurs. You don't want to get stuck.

                                                Any use of a fire extinguisher should be reported as soon as possible to the EHS Department. To ensure that the extinguisher is prepared to be used in an emergency, it must be examined and refilled.

                                                Before Fighting Fire
                                                Keep these things in mind:

                                                    Know what is burning. If you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs burning, you won‚Äôt know what kind of extinguisher to use.
                                                    In the fire, there may still be something that could explode or produce toxic fumes, even if you are using an ABC fire extinguisher.
                                                    Is the fire spreading rapidly beyond the point where it started? The beginning stages of the fire are when you should use an extinguisher.
                                                    If the fire is already spreading quickly, it is best to simply pull the fire alarm and evacuate the building.
                                                    When to Not Fight Fire

                                                    You don't have the right or sufficient equipment. It is advised to avoid attempting to put out the fire if you don't have the appropriate extinguisher or one that is large enough.

                                                    Smoke that is harmful may be inhaled. In addition to carbon monoxide, synthetic materials that burn include nylon in carpets and foam padding in furniture. These materials can also release ammonia, acrolein, and hydrogen cyanide. Very modest concentrations of these gases can be lethal.

                                                    Based on Legislation in GAR 8(3) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act


                                                    We also need to look at the reporting of workplace incidents where machinery is involved.

                                                    According to Regulation 7 of the General Machinery Regulations, the following incidents involving machinery must be reported to an inspector:
                                                    Where machinery ran out of control as a result of the failure of a control or safety equipment and could have caused an injury to a person who had been conveyed on or in such machinery or had been in the vicinity thereof
                                                    The fracture or failure of any part of machinery in which gas is under pressure results in the sudden release of such gas
                                                    Criminal Offense

                                                    It is a criminal offence not to report any of the above-mentioned incidents.



                                                    But how should employers report the above-mentioned incidents?

                                                    The employer shall, without delay, report these incidents by telephone, facsimile, or similar means of communication to the provincial director. 
                                                    It would, however, be advisable to keep a copy of the report as proof that the incident was reported to the director.
                                                     If an injured person dies after notification, the employer or user must notify the Director of the death.
                                                    Keep a Record

                                                    Based on Legislation in GAR 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act


                                                    The employer or user should keep a record of all section 24 incidents and of any other incident where medical treatment or first aid is involved, as per Annexure 1 form of the General Administrative Regulations. 
                                                    These records need to be kept for a period of at least three years.

                                                    According to the Occupational Health & Safety Act (Act no. 85 of 1993), what is:
                                                    Hazard means a source of risk or an area where danger may be present.
                                                    Any solid, liquid, vapour, gas, aerosol, or mixture of those is a substance.
                                                    Risk is the likelihood that harm or damage will be inflicted.
                                                    Safe entails being risk-free.
                                                    If an employee observes any unsafe or unhealthy situation, he or she must report it to the health and safety representative or the employer of the workplace.
                                                    Employees have the right not to be victimized by the employer. No employer may dismiss an employee from his or her service, reduce an employee‚Äôs salary or alter or reduce an employee‚Äôs service position to terms or conditions that are less favourable to the employee.

                                                    An employee that contravenes a section of the OHS Act could be prosecuted. They could receive a fine, penalty, and even imprisonment. (Maximum fine of R 50 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months or both

                                                The main points covered in the module are : 

                                                    There is a variety of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that you could use during an emergency. These may include gloves, safety glasses and shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, vests, and full-body suits.
                                                    Different classes of fires should be fought with their corresponding type of fire extinguishers. The three most common types of fire extinguishers are Water (APW= Air-Pressurized Water), Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Dry Chemical (ABC, BC, DC).
                                                    There are five officially recognized firefighting techniques used across a range of different fire situations. 
                                                    Section 24 incidents that should be reported and investigated include the following types of incidents:
                                                    1)When a person dies
                                                    2)When a person becomes unconscious
                                                    3)Suffers the loss of a limb or part of a limb
                                                    4)Is injured or becomes ill, or is likely to die or suffer permanent physical defect
                                                    5)Unable to work for 14 days or longer because of a work-related incident
                                                    6)When a ‚Äùmajor incident‚Äù occurs

                                                After completing this module, you will be able to :

                                                    Identify the requirements of Safety and Health legislation.
                                                    Identify roles, duties, and responsibilities for safety in schools and workplaces.
                                                    Describe a safety statement.
                                                    State the main features of a safety statement.

                                                Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005

                                                The 2005 Act states that "Every employer shall ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health, and welfare at work of his or her employees."

                                                Employer and Employees

                                                Students and Visitors

                                                Safety and Health Policy
                                                Consultation
                                                In the case of a school, the "employer" is the Board of Management, or the Vocational Education Committee (VEC).

                                                All teaching and ancillary staff are employees of the school, and so have the responsibilities and rights of employees as described in t
                                                Risk Assessment

                                                The control of risks is critical in meeting the requirements of the 2005 Act.

                                                There are three basic stages in making the workplace safe:

                                                    Identifying the hazards
                                                    Evaluating the risks
                                                    Implementing risk controls

                                                These stages are together known as "Risk Assessment" and are covered in this course.
                                                Reasonably Practicable: Many of the employer's requirements are to do as much "as is reasonably practicable" to provide a safe place, safe methods, and safe facilities for work. This means that the employer must exercise all due care, having identified the hazards and assessed the risks.
                                                Competence: The Act and associated regulations require the employer to appoint a "competent person" to advise on the management of safety and health or complete specific risk assessments in the school. A competent person must be deemed to have sufficient training, experience, and knowledge appropriate to the task. The Principal may consider teachers to be competent to conduct risk assessments in their own classrooms or workrooms.
                                                Duties and Responsibilities
                                                While school management authorities - in most cases, Boards of Management - have the ultimate responsibility for safety and health matters in schools, safety is everybody's responsibility. The 2005 Act applies to all employers, employees in all employments, and to the self-employed. It also has implications for persons who control places of work.
                                                The following are the various safety and health  duties  and responsibilities  of people within the school:
                                                Principal

                                                As the person in charge, the Principal oversees safety at the school. The Principal must ensure that the safety statement is applied and should strive to develop a safety culture at the school.
                                                Safety Officer 


                                                Safety Representative
                                                Employee Duties
                                                Employees' duties include complying with safety and health legislation and taking reasonable care to protect their own safety and that of others. They must report hazards or hazardous activity to management and take full account of training and instructions given by the Principal or any person acting on the employer's or Principal's behalf.
                                                Competent Persons
                                                The 2005 Act places a special emphasis on the competence of persons carrying out safety-related tasks. The Act states that a person is competent 'where, having regard to the task he/she is required to perform possesses sufficient training, experience, and knowledge.
                                                The Principal may consider a teacher competent to conduct a risk assessment within their own class environment or workroom, as part of managing safety in their school.
                                                Equipment and Chemicals

                                                The employer, through the Board of Management and Principal, must provide safe conditions and equipment. Teachers must ensure that the rooms where equipment and chemicals are being handled, used, and stored are safe.

                                                Where safety might be compromised, teachers must bring this to the Principal's attention. The Principal must then instigate appropriate action to eliminate or reduce the risk.
                                                Duties and Responsibilities - The Technology Classroom

                                                Before a new technology classroom is used for the first time, the technology teacher typically works with the Principal or safety officer to ensure that the technology classroom conforms to required standards. Equipment, fittings, lighting, ventilation, layout, signage must all be considered, and the school's maintenance staff may be required to assist.
                                                Teachers must manage safety and health matters related to their work. Section 15 of the 2005 Act outlines the general duties of persons in control of places of work.

                                                Students have a responsibility to act in a way that does not compromise the safety of anybody in the school.
                                                The technology teacher may take care of routine safety matters, like simple maintenance issues. If the matter is more complex, the technology teacher may liaise with the appropriate contacts at the school and relevant maintenance personnel.
                                                esponsibilities for Safety: Scenarios

                                                Recommendation: Shauna should tell her supervisor about the worn ladder. Her employer must provide a safe means of reaching heights, and the employer can examine ways of changing the system of work
                                                Employer‚Äôs Responsibilities
                                                The law requires that every employer ensures the safety, health and welfare of his or her employees while at work.
                                                Employers must:

                                                    Ensure the place of work is safe, and all plant, machinery, and equipment used for work are safe.
                                                    Provide and maintain safe working methods.
                                                    Prevent any conduct likely to put the safety of employees at risk.

                                                    Provide information, instruction, training, and supervision necessary to ensure the safety of employees at work.

                                                    Ensure risk assessments are carried out and implement measures necessary to ensure safety.

                                                    Prepare and revise plans and procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency.

                                                    Report accidents and dangerous occurrences as appropriate to the Health and Safety Authority.

                                                    The responsibilities of the employee are equally wide-ranging:
                                                        Comply with the law and take care to protect his or her safety, and the safety of any other person who may be affected by their actions at work.
                                                        Help the employer to comply with the relevant laws and regulations.
                                                        Not to work under the influence of drink or drugs, and be willing to take tests for both.
                                                        Attend safety training and assessments as required.

                                                        Report any situation to his/her employer where safety might be at risk.

                                                        Use safety equipment and facilities as specified.
                                                        Responsibilities of the Public
                                                        While employers and employees have specific duties in maintaining safety and health, everybody else has a duty to support their efforts. This applies to customers, suppliers, and all other visitors to a place of work. The law forbids anybody from interfering with, misusing, or damaging anything provided under safety and health legislation.
                                                        Self-Employed People
                                                        A self-employed person has the same responsibilities as any employer, and must ensure that people are safe where they work.
                                                        Responsibilities in Schools
                                                        In school, everybody present has a responsibility to ensure that the classrooms and common areas are safe.

                                                        For example, if you come across a coat lying across a walkway in the classroom, you should hang it up out of harm‚Äôs way.

                                                        If you see a trailing cable in the classroom, report it to the teacher who can take action.

                                                        If a window is broken, the broken glass is a serious hazard, you should tell your teacher or the caretaker as soon as possible.

                                                Hazards
                                                A hazard is anything that could cause harm. Hazards take many different shapes, and may even be Invisible. While some hazards are fairly easy to spot, others are not. For example, stress, exposure to noise, or radiation are less obvious than, say, a trailing cable.
                                                Hazards at School
                                                Some situations that may seem safe upon inspection may be hazards if viewed at a different time. For example, an obstacle In a corridor poses little threat during class times, but at lunch break or between Basses, It could be a serious trip hazard.
                                                Workplace Hazards
                                                The school is obliged by law to do all it can to ensure the safety of all who work and study there. You must identify the hazards and do what you can to eliminate or reduce the risk to a minimum.
                                                Types of Hazards
                                                High-stress levels, machinery, a poorly designed workstation can all be hazardous. It is important to be aware of all Types of Hazards.
                                                Hazards In the workplace may change with circumstances. A schoolbag is not hazardous in itself. However, left in a classroom aisle, it presents a trip hazard.
                                                Potential Hazards Found in Schools
                                                Hazards vary around the school. Consider the potential hazards of the kitchen, technology classroom, laboratory, sports hall and stores, and the general classroom. 

                                                    Kitchen: Slippery floors, Hot surfaces, Sharp objects, Chemical cleaners, Stress.
                                                    Technology Classroom: Sharp tools, Machinery, Manual handling, Trailing cables, Large pieces of materials, Dust, Manual handling.
                                                    Laboratory: Chemicals, Dissecting kit, Burners.
                                                    General Classroom: Damaged seats, Protruding nails or screws, Trailing cables, Broken sockets, Broken light fittings, Windows on the first floor and higher, Bullying.
                                                    Spots Hall and Store Room: Manual Handling, High shelving, Gym equipment, Bullying.
                                                    Types of Hazards


                                                    There are six basic hazard types. Knowing these will make it easier to spot hazards in many different contexts.
                                                    Biological Agent
                                                    Bacteria, Viruses, Substances from plants or animals causing infection and other health problems.
                                                    Health
                                                    Chemical
                                                    Physical
                                                    Human-Factor:

                                                    Ergonomic
                                                    Electricity: A Physical Hazard
                                                    Electricity is one of the most common physical hazards in any workplace, and must always be treated with caution.

                                                    Human-factor Hazards -1
                                                    Human-factor hazards like stress and bullying can be difficult to spot, but policies and practices must be implemented to prevent them from arising if possible, and to deal with them when they do occur.
                                                    What is Risk
                                                    Risk is the likelihood that a hazard will actually cause harm. For example, working at a height is a hazard. There is a risk of falling.
                                                    Working with cutting machines is a hazard. There may a risk from flying debris, or from becoming entangled.
                                                    Hazard and Risk
                                                    Chemicals held in containers are hazardous but there is very little risk while they are stored safely.
                                                    Serious risk can arise when chemicals are in use, whether in the laboratory or around the school. Be mindful that many cleaning agents can be hazardous.
                                                    Hazard versus Risk
                                                    Levels of risk vary with conditions. For example, most areas of the school are low risk at quiet times, but at lunchtime, when many students are moving about, risk levels rise noticeably.For example, the likelihood of an accident through
                                                    Measuring Risk
                                                    Risk Levels
                                                    A grass maintenance programme in a small school with a small lawn and no playing field presents a far lower level of risk than that of a large school with multiple areas and extensive grounds.
                                                    Risk Measurement Factors: The level of risk depends on how likely it is that a user will be injured under normal conditions and usage, how serious any injuries that result could be, and how many people are involved.
                                                    Calculating Risk - 1: Likelihood x Severity of the potential injury x Number of people who may be exposed to the hazard.
                                                    Consider a certain hazard, and rate that from 1, meaning not very likely, to 3 meaning quite likely. Then rate the possible Injury that might be caused by the hazard and rate 1 for not severe to 3, very severe. Finally, rate the number of people in contact with the hazard or the area around it, 1 for very few, to 3 for quite a lot.
                                                    Levels of Risk
                                                        High: A strong chance of injury occurring, and the injury could be serious or very serious.

                                                        Medium: Some chance of injury and severity. For example, an injury to a limb.
                                                        Low: Very little chance of injury and, if an injury were to happen, it would be very minor.
                                                        sk Assessment
                                                        Risk assessment is the consideration of any risk that may arise from identified hazards. It involves collecting information and making decisions.
                                                        If your assessment is that a risk exists, you must take action to eliminate or minimise that risk.
                                                        Risk Assessment Steps
                                                            Identify the hazards.
                                                            Estimate the risk from each hazard.
                                                            Consider how to eliminate or reduce that risk.
                                                            Document a plan to eliminate or minimise the hazard.
                                                        All employers must carry out risk assessments for every activity that occurs on their premises, Identify hazards, and assess the risks arising
                                                        imple Risk Assessment - Manual Handling
                                                        Consider a load of heavy boxes delivered to the school. Heavy loads can cause a serious back injury to somebody who does not lift them properly, or for whom they are too heavy. The hazard is the heavy load; the risk is the chance of a back injury.
                                                        To lift safely you should:
                                                            Clear the area of all obstacles.
                                                            Give yourself plenty of room.
                                                            Consider the weight and shape of the load.
                                                            Keep feet hip-distance apart.
                                                            Stand with feet in the direction you are going.
                                                            Place feet firmly on the ground.

                                                            Bend your knees, not your back.
                                                            Grip firmly using the palm of your hand.
                                                            Keep close to the load.
                                                            If there is equipment available for moving the load, it should be used ‚Äî a hand trolley or a pallet truck, for example. Good practice for lifting heavy loads is well documented, and a staff who engages in manual lifting must be provided with training in the correct techniques.
                                                            There are two ways to reduce the risk of injury. The actual measures taken will depend on the load.
                                                            Risk Assessment and the Law
                                                            All employers must carry out complete risk assessments for their premises. They identify hazards and assess the risks. They must decide how to deal with the risks, and draw up a plan of action.
                                                            All of this is documented in the safety statement, as specified by the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The documented risk assessment is the most important part of the safety statement.





                                                    Human-factor Hazards - 2
                                                    All schools have policies to deal with bullying among students. There is also a need to develop and implement a policy to protect staff from workplace bullying.

                                                Competent Person
                                                The employer must appoint a competent person to carry out a risk assessment. A competent person is one with sufficient training, experience, and knowledge to perform a task.

                                                The Principal may consider a teacher competent to carry out a risk assessment in his/her own classroom or area of work.

                                                The person responsible for the risk assessment must sign the document upon completion. azard versus Risk - 1

                                                Chemicals held in containers are hazardous but there is very little risk while they are stored safely. If, however, you take the chemical off the shelf and pour it into another container, there is a risk of harmful vapour. If you spill the chemical on the floor, the risk increases.
                                                Hazard versus Risk -2
                                                Flour would not be considered by many to be a hazardous substance. If, however, a baker IS exposed to flour dust over a period of time, either airborne or by skin contact, there is a risk that the baker could develop an inflammation of the skin, nose, or even asthma. There is also the risk of injury through manual handling of the large bags of flour, or burns from the hot ovens.
                                                Hazard versus Risk -3

                                                Now consider electricity as a hazard. One risk is the likelihood that a worker might be electrocuted because of exposure to electrical wires that are inadequately insulated.
                                                Control Measures
                                                To eliminate or reduce risk, you put control measures in place.  When deciding how to control risk, you should follow the General Principles of Prevention, set out in the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005. 

                                                Nine Principles of Prevention:

                                                     Avoidance: The avoidance of risks or removing the risk altogether.
                                                     Evaluation:  The evaluation of unavoidable risks. Calculate the level of those risks that cannot be avoided.
                                                    Combating: The combating of risks at source, taking immediate action where possible.
                                                    Adaptation of work: The adaptation of work to the individual, especially with regard to the design of places of work, and the choice of work equipment.
                                                    Adaptation of place: The adaptation of the place of work to technical progress.
                                                    Replacement:  The replacement of dangerous articles, substances, systems of work by safe or less dangerous alternatives.
                                                    Giving of priority: The giving of priority to collective protective measures over individual protective measures - look after everyone and not just the individual.
                                                    Development of policy: The development of an adequate prevention policy in relation to this type of risk.
                                                    Employers must apply the principles of prevention to avoid hazards. Where hazards cannot be avoided, employers must assess the risk and reduce it by using measures that protect all workers or by using safer work procedures.
                                                    Where hazards cannot be avoided or reduced, employers have a duty to put in place appropriate measures for the protection of workers such as training and signage.
                                                    Avoidance
                                                    The first option you must consider when dealing with risk is to avoid the hazard completely, and so eliminate the risk altogether. If you can, you remove the dangerous item, or rearrange things so that the hazard no longer exists.
                                                    Evaluation
                                                    When you cannot remove risk, you must evaluate the risk that you can't avoid. This allows you to analyse the situation and helps you to come up with solutions.
                                                    Risk Reduction
                                                    After evaluation, you act to reduce the level of risk. This might mean, for example, making sure that there is somebody holding the bottom of a ladder, when in use.
                                                    Training
                                                    If you cannot eliminate or reduce the risk sufficiently, training should also be introduced on safe practice. First Aid and manual handling training are two areas of training often required in schools.
                                                    Protective Equipment
                                                    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should be the final option considered, and be implemented alongside training. When there are no adequate means to eliminate the risks involved in a task, you need to ensure that the staff member or student wears suitable personal protective equipment. Employees are obliged to wear PPE when instructed to do so by their employer.
                                                    ‚ÄúStudents Circulating in Numbers‚Äù
                                                    Students create additional risk as they circulate in numbers about the school. You can reduce collisions and the consequent risk of injury by managing that circulation.
                                                    ‚ÄòKeep-left‚Äô or ‚Äòone-way‚Äô systems can be effective, especially on stairs and in narrow corridors
                                                    Working Safely
                                                    Safe System of Work
                                                    Every employer must implement a safe system of work. This means that employers must provide systems of work that are planned, organised, performed, maintained, and revised as appropriate. Hazards associated with work activities must be identified and appropriate control measures put in place before work commences. All workers must be made aware of their responsibilities regarding safety.
                                                    Safety Duties
                                                    As an employer, or, as in the case of a School Principal, the representative of the employer, you are obliged to inform all staff of their safety duties. Students also need to know that they have a responsibility not to behave in a way that might add or create risk.
                                                    Safety Culture
                                                    You also need to develop a safety culture in the school, so that safety becomes natural and is not regarded as a chore. Relevant safety signage, training, and discussions of safety issues can serve well in this regard. Attitudes are also a key element of a safety culture.
                                                    Use of Chemicals in Schools
                                                    Policies With regard to handling, use, and storage of chemicals, whether in the laboratory or stored for cleaning or maintenance, must be clear and comprehensive. Clear labeling of containers and secure well-managed storage. 

                                                    Suitable protective clothing must be worn when handling dangerous substances.
                                                    Disposal of waste materials must be contr
                                                    Movement and Use of Chemicals in the Workplace
                                                    Chemicals are used in many different workplaces. For example, hairdressers, builders, cleaners, and chefs all use chemicals of various sorts, and some of these chemicals can pose a serious risk in the workplace. Let‚Äôs learn about these risks and about controlling them.
                                                    Chemical Hazards 
                                                    Chemicals can be:

                                                        Ingested through the mouth.
                                                        Inhaled.

                                                        Absorbed through the skin.
                                                        Injected.
                                                    olled and safe for staff, students, and the environment

                                                    You can:
                                                        Avoid accidental ingestion by maintaining good practices like washing hands after using chemicals or dangerous materials.
                                                        Avoid or reduce inhalation by using filter masks and other protective equipment and fume extractors.
                                                        Avoid accidental absorption by wearing suitable protective clothing.

                                                        Accidental injection can be avoided by good safety practices.
                                                    Using Chemicals: What to Do
                                                    Using Chemicals What NOT to Do
                                                    - Read and understand the label and the process for which you want to use the chemical.
                                                    - Follow any available instructions.
                                                    - Wear protective clothing and use protective equipment.
                                                    - Know and follow safe procedures.
                                                    - Wash your hands before and after use.
                                                    - Store the container properly after use.
                                                    - Ask for advice if you have any doubts.

                                                Transportation of Chemicals
                                                Dangerous substances, including petrol, gases, and numerous industrial chemicals, are transported by road and rail every day. These loads are subject to strict regulation to ensure the safety of the people working with them and the general public.
                                                Labelling of Dangerous Substances
                                                Currently in the EU, dangerous substances carry orange labels with pictograms indicating the type of hazard presented: for instance, explosive, flammable, highly toxic.

                                                GHS Pictograms
                                                The new Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling (sic) of Chemicals or GHS, is being adopted in many countries around the world as a common way of representing chemical hazards.
                                                Safety Data Sheets
                                                Each supplier of chemicals must provide a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for each chemical that they sell. This tells how the chemical works in ordinary use, what to do if there are accidents, and how to dispose of it when finished with.
                                                Check course resources for full details on Safety Data Sheets
                                                Control Hierarchy:

                                                    Eliminate.
                                                    Substitute.
                                                    Reduce.
                                                    Engineering Controls.
                                                    PPE.


                                                Controls should be considered in the order shown above. First, try to eliminate the risk completely. Second, try to substitute the hazardous item with something less dangerous. Third, reduce the risk by adapting the process, the materials, the workplace, or a combination of these. Fourth, put engineering controls in place to reduce the chances of harm; and lastly, make sure the worker wears suitable personal protective equipment, or PPE.
                                                Ergonomics
                                                One way to reduce the risk of injury is to apply ergonomics. Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplaces to the people working there, Information about the abilities and behaviour of people at work is used to help create better workplaces, tools, and tasks.
                                                Follow these ergonomic guidelines for safe working:


                                                    Avoid bending forward, this makes it hard for you to maintain your balance.

                                                    Change your posture and your movements frequently, repetitive movements can cause injury.


                                                Ergonomics and Posture
                                                Sitting at a desk with poor posture can cause backache, eyestrain, and a condition called RSI, repetitive strain injury. Ergonomics experts recommend a set of measurements to ensure good posture and to reduce the risk of these problems.
                                                Learning Outcomes
                                                After completing this module, you will be able to:

                                                Emergency Planning, Reporting Accidents/Dangerous Occurrences
                                                Emergency Planning
                                                An emergency plan is something you may never have to put into action, but you always need to have at the ready.
                                                Documented Preparation
                                                Emergency planning should include documented preparation for safety-critical situations. With a thorough plan in place, you can help to keep injury to persons and damage to property to a minimum. The plan should be included in the safety statement as required by section 20 of the 2005 Act.
                                                Prepare Staff
                                                The first priority should be to prepare all staff for procedures in the event of a fire or other emergency. Identify key staff such as fire wardens, first aiders, and so on. You need to allow time for training to ensure duty holders have relevant skills.
                                                Fire Wardens 
                                                Fire wardens must know the procedures for fire drills and evacuation from school buildings. Checklists, emergency routes and exits, and assembly points all form part of the plan In case of fire. You must also specify for decking specific rooms, and for calling rolls of attendance at assembly points.

                                                Roll Calls

                                                Regular fire drills allow everybody to become familiar with the emergency evacuation plan and how it is applied. You also get a chance to review and revise the plan.
                                                Fire drills also help you to make sure that everybody adheres to safe practices. For instance, you can check that emergency routes and exits are being kept clear.


                                                Equipment
                                                Alarms, fire extinguishers and other fire safety equipment should be checked regularly and serviced by a competent person as necessary. A short fire-alarm test at a fixed time on the same day every week keeps disruption to a minimum.

                                                Emergency Services
                                                The emergency services should be familiar with facilities at the school so that they know what to expect in the event of an emergency on the premises. The Gardai and the Fire Service should have copies of the school layout.

                                                Alarms: The plan includes details of warning and alarm systems, including the maintenance schedules.
                                                Scenarios: You need to list emergency scenarios that might occur and outline plans for dealing with these scenarios.

                                                Accidents and Dangerous Occurrences
                                                "Accident" means an incident arising out of, or in the course of, employment which, in the case of carrying out work, results in personal injury;
                                                "Incident" means an unplanned event, with the potential to lead to an accident.

                                                "Dangerous occurrence" means an occurrence arising from work activities in a place of work that causes or results in a hazardous situation. A dangerous occurrence could be the malfunction of any work equipment, a fire involving any substance, or any unintentional explosion.
                                                The safety statement should include a general plan for dealing with accidents and dangerous occurrences. A comprehensive statement would include plans for dealing with the death or serious injury of an individual relating to the activities of the school or the workplace..
                                                Reports
                                                An employer's duties include reporting work-related accidents and dangerous occurrences to the Health and Safety Authority (HSA). There are specific forms used for these reports: IR1 and IR3. Both forms may be downloaded from www.hsa.ie.
                                                Reporting Requirements
                                                You must report the death or injury of a person caused by an accident during the course of their work. You must also report any injury, sustained in the course of employment, which prevents a person from performing the normal duties of their work for more than three calendar days, not including the date of the accident.
                                                Notification is required in the following circumstances:

                                                    The death of any employed or self-employed person, which was caused by an accident during the course of their work.
                                                    An injury sustained In the course of their employment, which prevents any employed or self-employed person from performing the normal duties of their work for more than three calendar days, not including the date of the accident. Calendar days include Saturdays and Sundays.
                                                    ¬∑A death, or an injury that requires treatment by a registered medical practitioner, which does not occur while a person is at work, but is related to either a work activity or their place of work. Deaths or Injuries caused by normal medical treatment (e.g. surgery or medication) do not need to be reported.

                                                     A road traffic accident that meets the criteria (a) and (b) above, excluding an accident tha
                                                    Reporting
                                                    Some activities that may cause Injury to non-workers, such as students, are not reportable to the HSA. These Injuries occur during non-work-related activities such as playing in the schoolyard. However, if a student IS injured as a result of work activity, and requires medical treatment by a registered medical practitioner, this is reportable to the HSA.
                                                    Fatalities
                                                    Fatal or potentially fatal accidents must be reported immediately to the HSA, by telephone in the first instance. Fatalities must also be notified immediately to the Gardai and emergency services. The scene of a work-related fatality should be preserved for the Gardai and Inspectors to carry out their investigations. 

                                                    Effective Reporting
                                                    For best results, you should ensure that a responsible person completes a report as soon as possible after an accident or dangerous occurrence. They should speak to as many witnesses to the incident as possible. A record of all work-related accidents and dangerous occurrences must be maintained by the school. A fire at the school may be reportab
                                                    t occurs while a person is commuting either to or from work.
                                                    Report Forms
                                                    Completed IR1 and IR3 forms should be returned to the HSA in compliance with the legislation. Copies of these forms should be retained in the school for record purposes. These records must be held for ten years.
                                                    Follow-up Investigations
                                                    Following an accident or dangerous occurrence, you must review the findings and take appropriate action. This action may also include advice or directions given by an HSA Inspector. This should be done in co-operation with the safety committee, where one exists.
                                                    Corrective Action
                                                    Having isolated the cause of the accident you must take corrective action. Record any new control measure in the school safety statement and consult all those affected by the work activity.
                                                    Importance of Communication
                                                    Clear communication is very important for safety. After accidents and injuries, you must gather details swiftly and dearly. Then you must interpret the report and act to ensure that whatever lesson has been learned is put into practice. Any changes must be made clear to all concerned.
                                                    Accident Report Scenario
                                                    Investigation Procedures
                                                    The school should have effective procedures in place for reporting and investigating accidents, cases of work-related illness, or other incidents. These procedures should be part of the safety statement. With an effective follow-up, they can help to prevent further accidents or illness.
                                                    Procedures for Investigating Accidents:

                                                Lesson Summary
                                                The main points covered in this module are:

                                                    Close protection exists to provide security and reduce risks to public figures or anyone who feels vulnerable.
                                                    The principal is an individual or a group that requires personal protection.
                                                    The Close Protection Team encompasses various CPOs, who are all responsible for the principal.
                                                    Desirable characteristics of a CPO include good communication skills, balanced education, loyalty, extensive training etc.
                                                    The PES team constantly evaluates the changing circumstances around their VIP through their eyes and other senses, and they are ready to respond when the situation calls for it.
                                                    The bodyguard is the person who remains alongside and closest to the VIP.

                                                    The threat assessment is the foundation of all the safeguarding efforts in the world of close protection defence.
                                                    An individual or a group can make threats against the principal's characteristics and his position.
                                                    Threat assessment should be clear, logical, accurate, relevant and comprehensive.
                                                    CPOs must consider the potential ability of the source of the threat to carry out a direct or indirect threat against

    The advent of electricity in homes, offices and industries marks the beginning of the modern age of technological development. Electricity has become such an essential part of our contemporary lives that we cannot imagine a world without it. It has been described as one of the "good fortunes that science has given to man," and the development of any country is measured by the rate of its electrical energy consumption. But electrical energy is not visible. As such, electrical engineers must study models from physics and mathematics to help them understand the mechanics and applications of electricity.

    This course highlights the fundamental ideologies of the core elements of electrical engineering, including the theories and principles of energy conversion, transmission and utilisation. We study atomic theory, electromotive force, conductance and conductivity, Ohm's law and more. Moreover, we dissect work, energy and power before treating DC networks and network theorems. We investigate the three classifications of DC circuits and also show you how to read and connect circuit diagrams in experimental or real-world scenarios.

    Finally, we explain the mathematical method for nodal analysis and the system for calculating the current flowing through a planar circuit (i.e., mesh analysis). Then, you will learn about the superposition, Thevenin's and Norton's theorems of linear and terminal networks. We will delve into single-phase AC circuits and electrical machines to study the characteristics and applications of DC generators, motors and transformers. Enrol today and start learnin

        rigonometry is a very important tool for engineers and not just a subject to be studied in a classroom with no real-world practical applications. Trigonometry is the study of triangles and the principles are fundamental in electrical engineering because it is used to create circuits and describe the sinusoidal movement and characteristics of current and voltages in circuits. This electrical engineering course begins by introducing you to triangles and their theorems. You will learn about different types of triangles, intersecting lines and parallel lines. Thereafter, you will discover how to differentiate between congruent and similar triangles as well as supplementary and complementary angles. Moving on from there, you will be taught how to prove the Pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find the missing sides of a triangle. This online electrical course explores the unique angles and their expression as both a function and simple ratios as well as trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.

        Electrical parameters and values are better understood using the concept of the unit circle, angles, sine, cosine and tangent values and you will be taught how to express the sine, cosine and tangents of special angles in simple ratios. Through the concept of the unit circle, you will then gain an understanding of why the trigonometric functions have a negative sign for some angles. Since there are many special angles, remembering them can be a great challenge. Have you ever wondered if there is a simple way to easily remember the values of these special angles? Well yes, there is! This certificate in electrical engineering provides you with a trigonometric table that would help you easily remember the values of special angles and trigonometric functions without having to use a calculator. The laws of sine and cosine will also be taught in order to calculate the missing sides or unknown sides of a triangle as well as missing angles.

        As an electrical engineer, you are at one point in your career going to run into proofs of trigonometric equations. This electrical engineering online course is going to teach you how to prove basic trigonometric identities such as the sum formula, difference formula, product to sum and sum to product formulas. You will also learn about the reciprocal identities, quotient identities, negative angle identities and Pythagorean identities. The content also covers how to prove the double-angle and half-angle formulas and how to apply them to solve trigonometric problems and then concluding with how to use trigonometric tables to find the sine, cosine and tangent of angles between 0 and 90 degrees. Basic knowledge of intermediate mathematics such as equations and binomials is required to gain the most value out of this interesting course. You should enrol for this course if you are an electrical engineer, technologist or student of engineering and technology because the fundamental knowledge of trigonometry is widely applied in these and related fields and can open a new set of potential job opportunities.
