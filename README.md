    Identify various microphone techniques and compare their effects on sound capture.
    Outline the primary goals of mixing and mastering in audio production.
    Apply level balancing, panning, and EQ techniques to create cohesive mixes.
    Lesson Summary
        Recording involves capturing sound waves and converting them into digital or analog formats for playback. This process requires careful planning, from selecting the right equipment to optimizing the recording environment.
        The recording environment plays a significant role in the quality of the captured sound. Acoustic treatments like foam panels, bass traps, and diffusers minimize unwanted reflections and ensure clarity.
        After initial recording, the focus shifts to editing, where engineers refine audio to achieve a polished result. Editing involves tasks like cutting, comping, noise reduction, and aligning performances to a timing grid.
        One critical step is comping, which involves selecting the best sections from multiple takes and combining them into a seamless performance. This technique is especially useful for vocals and intricate instrumental recordings.
        Mixing is the process of balancing and blending individual audio tracks to create a cohesive piece of music or sound. Engineers adjust levels, panning, equalization, and effects to shape the sonic landscape.Level balancing ensures that each element in a mix is appropriately audible. Engineers carefully control the volume of instruments and vocals to maintain clarity while emphasizing key elements.
        Lesson Summary
            Sound is the vibration of air molecules that creates pressure waves perceptible to the human ear. It has essential properties like frequency, which determines pitch, and amplitude, which governs loudness. Understanding these principles is fundamental to sound engineering, a field focused on capturing, manipulating, and reproducing sound effectively.
            Sound engineering involves both scientific and creative processes. Engineers use their technical expertise to design and operate recording equipment while employing artistic judgment to shape the sound’s aesthetic. This dual role requires a strong understanding of acoustics, physics, and the psychological impact of sound.
            Signal flow refers to the path audio signals take from their source to the output. It begins at the sound source, such as a voice or instrument, and moves through various stages, including microphones, preamplifiers, and processors, before reaching speakers or headphones.
            The first stage in signal flow involves capturing the audio signal. Microphones convert sound waves into electrical signals, with different types suited for specific applications. For example, dynamic microphones are durable and ideal for live settings, while condenser microphones capture subtle details in studio environments.
            Electroacoustic devices are tools that convert sound energy into electrical energy or vice versa. They are essential in sound engineering for capturing, manipulating, and reproducing audio. Examples include microphones, speakers, and headphones.
            Microphones are the primary electroacoustic devices used for capturing sound. Dynamic microphones operate using electromagnetic induction, making them durable and suitable for high-pressure sound environments. Condenser microphones, on the other hand, use capacitors and require phantom power, offering high sensitivity and detail.

        Introduction
        The word 'Engineering" originated from the Latin root ingeniere, which means to design or to devise. The Latin root "in generate" means "to create". Engineers are individuals who design industrial products by combining the knowledge of science, mathematics, and economics and develop the technology for outputting a product to solve problems that are beneficial to society. 
        Mechanical engineers are involved in the research, development, design, manufacturing, and testing the tools, engines, machines, and other mechanical devices. 
        In this topic, you will learn briefly about what mechanical engineering is all about.
        What is Engineering?
        To put it in a simple way, engineers are involved in developing new and better technologies using their knowledge of mathematics, science, and materials. 
        However, they are not solely restricted to the development of new technology but also to communication and skills.
        What is Engineering?
        Many students start studying mechanical engineering due to their interest in mathematics and science. Others because they are interested in technology. 
        However, whatever an individual interest may be, by the end of the day, the objective of an engineer is to build a device that can do a task accurately, quickly, and safely. Before any metal is cut or hardware is manufactured, an engineer can refine ideas on paper and with computer simulations, saving time and money by testing fewer mock-ups.
        What is Mechanics?
        The branch of natural science that deals with the state of motion and the state of the rest of the masses under the action of force is mechanics. Mechanics has been at the centre of interest of many philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists for many centuries. 
        The mechanics developed by the scientists can be classified into the following classes:
            Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Mechanics.
            Relativistic Mechanics.
            Quantum Mechanics.
        What is Mechanics?
        Sir Isaac Newton combined the philosophy and experimental observations involving the state of matter in the states of rest and motion and deducted the three laws of motion and the law of gravitation. Classical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics is based on these laws.
        Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
        When the length scale goes down to the atomic length scale, certain phenomena can not be explained with
        Newtonian mechanics. The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviors of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Qu
        Laws of Mechanics
        In this section, we will discuss the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics. First, we will discuss Newton's three laws of motion, and then we will discuss the gravitational law of Newton.
        Newton's First Law of Motion
        Newton's Second Law of Motion
        Newton's Third Law of Motion
        Newton's Law of Gravitation
        calars and Vectors
        In engineering mechanics, scalars or vectors are used to measure all physical quantities.
            Scalar: Any physical quantity, either positive or negative, that can be completely described by its magnitude is a scalar. Scalar quantities include things like length, mass, and time.
            Vector: Any physical quantity that needs both a magnitude and a direction to be fully described is referred to as a vector. Velocity, force, and moment are a few statics-related examples of vectors. Typically, an arrow is used for the visual representation of a vector.
            The magnitude of the vector: the length of the arrow.
            The vector's line of action: the angle between the line and a fixed axis.
            The vector's sense of direction: the arrow's head or tip corresponds to.
            The vector quantities are represented by:
            In print: by bold letters, e.g., A.
            In handwriting: by drawing an arrow on top of it.
        Statement: Every object continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled by an external agency acting on it
        Newton's first law of motion has defined force as an external agency that influences the state of motion or the rest of an object.
        A body in rest or in motion will remain in its position with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.
        Vector Operations
        In this section, we will discuss different vector operations that are essential for engineering problems.
        Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
        A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
        Vector Addition Operations
        The vector addition of different vector quantities obeys the parallelogram law of addition. The vector addition operation of two vectors A and B is illustrated in Fig. 2 and done by the following procedure:
        1. Connect the component vectors A and 8 1 s tails together at a point to make them concurrent.
        2. Draw a line parallel to A from the head of B. Similarly, draw another line parallel to B from the head of A. The neighbouring sides of a parallelogram are formed by the intersection of these two lines at point P (Figure: 2).
        3. The diagonal R of this parallelogram that extends to P is the resultant of the vector R = A + B.
        Equilibrium of a Particle
        Condition for the Equilibrium of a particle
        If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
        The word "equilibrium," or more specifically "static equilibrium," is most frequently used to refer to an item that is at rest. The resulting force acting on a particle must be equal to zero in order to satisfy Newton's first equation of motion and preserve Equilibrium. This circumstance can be represented numerically as:-
        The above equation represents the vector sum of all the forces acting on the particle. This equation is the sufficient condition for Equilibrium. 
        Basic Terminology in Thermodynamics
        Before we move into the world of thermodynamics, we should first discuss the macroscopic and microscopic points of view along with some basic terminology.
        Boundary
        A boundary is a closed surface that separates a constrained space or a finite amount of substance from its surroundings
        System
        Surroundings
        An Open System
        A Closed System
        The Macroscopic Point of View
        The Microscopic Point of View
        ntroduction
        Fluid mechanics is the study of all fluids in static and dynamic conditions. Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium. This topic will introduce you to the physical concepts that underpin fluid mechanics.
        Fluid Mechanics
        The main difference between a fluid and a solid is that a solid deforms only a finite amount due to applied shear stress until the elastic limit. 
        On the other hand, the fluid continuously deforms as long as the shear stress is applied.
        Both gases and liquids fall under the term "fluid". We will use the term "fluid" to apply to either a gas or liquid.
        Lesson Summary
            Mechanical engineering is a discipline that studies the properties of forces, materials, energy, fluids, and motion, as well as how to use those features to create products that progress the society and enhance people's lives.
            The development and commercialisation of the vehicle were considered to be the profession's greatest accomplishment of the 20th century.
            Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
            The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviours of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Quantum mechanics was laid by Schrodinger (1887—1961) and de Broglie (1892-1965).
            According to Newton's second law of motion, the force acting on an object is proportional to the time rate of change of momentum. Newton's third law is the law of action and reaction.
            A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
            If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
            ouple is defined as two parallel forces that have the same magnitude, but opposite directions and are separated by a perpendicular distance d. A moment of a couple is the moment produced by a couple.
            Thermal equilibrium is the state that two (or more) systems reach after being in communication with one another through a diathermic wall and is defined by constrained values of the systems' coordinates.
            A process is referred to as adiabatic if there is no heat transfer occurring. The word adiabatic originates from the Greek term adiabatos, which means not to be transmitted. A process can be adiabatic in one of two ways:
            According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may only change forms during a process; it cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, during a procedure, every amount of energy should be taken into account.
            A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between any two points is independent of the path taken by the particle.
            Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium.

            Lesson Summary
                Machines are beneficial by changing the amount of force or the speed of action. A simple example of a machine can be a claw hammer. 
                Friction is the resistance that one surface offers to another surface as it moves across it. The nature of the two surfaces and the forces holding them together affect how much friction there is.
                A bearing is a support and guide that shuttles one or more moving machine components. It keeps the immobile part and any moving pieces in their normal position.
                A mechanism that can mechanically add and subtract is a gear differential. To be more precise, we should say that it adds the total revolutions of two shafts.
                Any mechanism that connects two parts is referred to as a coupling. Shaft couplings come in a variety of designs, and they can be used to join line shafts that are made up of multiple shafts of various lengths.
                To avoid vibration problems, minimise excitation forces via balancing or mass balancing, and avoid force propagation by isolating or absorbing vibrations.
                The mechanical design creates mechanical parts, components, products, or systems. The mechanical design includes creating numerous machine elements such as shafts, bearings, clutches, gears, and fasteners.
                Hydraulic machines and tools use liquid fluid power to do simple tasks. Heavy machinery is a typical example. Hydraulic fluid is carried throughout the machine to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders, where it becomes pressurised based on the resistance present.
                Lesson Summary
                    One application of jet impact is the generation of energy. The effect of the jet is used to rotate the turbine, namely the Pelton wheel in the generator: The force applied by the water jet is tangential to the wheel.
                    A hydraulic turbine is a machine that converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. The hydraulic turbines are also known as water turbines. The hydraulic turbine can be categorised into two.
                    In a reaction turbine, the total energy at the inlet of a turbine is kinetic energy and pressure energy. It is used for the low head of water. The Francis and Kaplan turbines are inward and axial flow reaction tur

                    Application of Solidification
                    The backbone of the real industrial environment is workshop practice, which helps develop and improve critical technical hand skills required by technicians working in various engineering sectors and workshops.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    The gating system is the passageway that transports the molten metal into the mould chamber. A gating system comprises four parts: a pouring cup, a down gate or sprue, a runner, and an ingate.Parting line gates, bottom gates, horn gates, branch gates, and top gates are examples of gates. 
                    A riser (or feed head) is a hole in the cope. Its primary function is to feed molten metal into the casting as it solidifies, compensating for shrinkage. The risers also act as an enormous vent for generated steam and gases and a loose sand or slag collection point.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    Cores are sand bodies used to generate hollow parts or cavities of a desired shape and size in a casting. In addition to developing internal cavities in the casting, the cores perform the following functions:
                        The cores may be used to construct a complete mould.
                        The cores may be used to form a part of a green sand mould.
                        The cores strengthen or improve a mould surface.
                        The cores may be used as a part of the gating system.
                    Depending upon their position, the various cores are horizontal cores, vertical cores, balanced cores, drop cores, and cover cores or hanging cores.
                    Types of Casting Processes
                    Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set. This will raise the production cost. Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish.

                    Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish. The following casting procedures may be utilised to achieve these requirements:
                    Permanent Mould Casting
                    Slush Casting
                    Die Casting
                    Permanent mould casting is a casting created by gravity pouring molten metal into a mould composed of some metallic alloy or other substance of permanence. This technique of casting is also known as die casting.
            list-icon2
        Die Casting Machines
        Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine
        The melting pot is a vital feature of a hot chamber die casting machine. At pressures ranging from 7 to 14 MPa, molten metal is driven into the die cavity. The pressure can be generated using compressed air or a hydraulically powered plunger. Hot chamber die casting machines are used to make zinc, tin, lead, and other low melting alloys.

        Centrifugal casting refers to pouring molten metal into a rotating mould and allowing it to harden. Centrifugal casting refers to the castings generated by this centrifugal force. This method is very useful for casting symmetrical pieces. This technique may cast both ferrous and n
        Defects in Casting
        Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal. The following are some of the flaws:
            Mould shift: It causes a mismatch between the top and bottom parts, typically at the parting line.
            Swell: It is a localised or overall enlargement of the casting caused by molten metal pressure enlargement of the mould chamber.
            Fins and flash: These are thin metal projections that are not designed to be cast. These typically appear at the mould's parting line.
            Sand wash: It commonly appears as rough bumps on the surface of casting near the ingates.
            Shrinkage in casting: It is a crack in the casting or dishing on the casting's surface caused by unequal contraction of the metal during solidification.
            Hot tear: It is a ragged internal or exterior discontinuity in a metal casting caused by inhibited contraction shortly after the metal has set.
            Sand blow or blowhole in casting: It is a dip on the outside surface of an exceptionally smooth casting.
            Honeycombing or slag holes in the casting: These are smooth depressions on the casting's upper surface. They are frequently seen around the ingates.
            Defects in Casting
                Scabs: These are sand patches on the casting's upper surface.
                Cold shuts and misruns: These arise when the mould cavity is not filled, resulting in a bad casting.
                Pour short: This casting flaw occurs when the mould cavity is not filled due to a lack of metal.
                Run-outs and bust-outs: These allow the metal to drain from the hollow, resulting in unfinished castings.
                Introduction
                Workshop technology is the branch of technology that deals with the many processes involved in manufacturing machine or equipment components. 

                This topic is intended to provide the learner with the information, abilities, and mindsets needed to accomplish fundamental workshop tasks.
                Electric Resistance Welding & Its Types
                Pressure Welding
                Controlling Current Quantity
                Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage (from 6 to 10 volts only), and high amperage (ranging from 60 to 4000 amperes) electr
        onferrous metals. This method yields castings with a dense and fine-grained structure.
        Electric Resistance Welding
        The following are the numerous forms of electric resistance welding:
        Spot welding
        Projection welding
        Butt welding
        It is used for welding lap joints and joining components composed of plate material ranging in thickness from 0.025 mm to 1.25 mm. The plates to be linked are sandwiched between two copper or copper alloy electrode points. It should be noted:
        • The electrode tip diameter.
        • The distance between the plate's nearest edge and the centre of the weld should be at least 1.5d.
        • The distance between two spot welds s
        rc Welding - Types & Processes
        Arc welding is a fusion welding procedure that generates heat by striking an electric arc between the work (or base metal) and on electrode. The heat produced by the electric arc has a temperature range of 6O00°C to 7OOO•C. 
        Arc welding can be done with direct current (D.C.) and alternating current (A.C.): however, direct current is recommended for most applications.
        The welding set-up is considered to have straight polarity when the work is connected to the positive terminal of a D.C. welding machine and the negative terminal to an electrode holder. When the work is connected to the negative terminal and the electrode to the positive terminal, the welding set-up is said to have reversed polarity. 

        Straight polarity is preferred for some welds, whereas reversed polarity is preferred for others. Depending on the type of electrode, there are two forms of arc welding:
            Un-shielded arc welding: Un-shielded arc welding is when a large electrode or filler rod is utilised for welding.
            Shielded arc welding: Shielded arc welding is performed when welding rods covered with fluxing material are employed.
        hould not be less than 3d, and it should be equal to I, where I is the thickness of the plate to be welded.
        as Welding & Types of Flames
        It is a type of fusion welding in which heat is generated by the combustion of fuel gas. Oxygen and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals (C2H2). The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200° C. The following are the essential equipment necessary for oxy-acetylene gas welding:
        Welding Torch
        It is sometimes referred to as a blowpipe, a device for mixing the proper amounts of oxygen and acetylene and then burning the mixture at the end of a tip, producing a high-temperature flame. Welding torches are commercially available in two varieties:
        Injector Or Low-Pressure Type
        Positive Or Equal Pressure
        Injector or low-pressure type: The injector or low-pressure type welding torch runs at less than 7 kN/m2 acetylene pressure. The chemical reaction between water and calcium carbide produces this low-pressure acetylene at the welding site (CaC2). However, depending on the tip size, the oxygen is delivered at pressures ranging from 70 to 280 kN/m2.

        Pressure Regulators
        Hose And Hose Fittings
        Gas Cylinders
        Gas Welding Technique & Oxygen Cutting
        The usual gas welding techniques in oxy-acetylene welding are as follows:
        Leftword Or Forehand Welding
        The welding torch is held in the operator's right hand, with the tip pointed to the left, and the weld is mode from right to left. The torch forms a 6O• - 70° angle with the plate, while the welding rod forms a 30• - 40° angle. Welding plates thicker than 6mm are not cost-effective with this technology.

        ntroduction
        While studying engineering, specifically mechanical and civil engineering, it is very important to know the basics of engineering drawing. Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item. In this topic, we will briefly introduce ourselves to the basics of engineering drawing.
        Drawing
        A drawing is a graphical presentation of an actual object, an idea, or a suggested design that will eventually be built. 
        Drawing can take many different shapes, but the graphic manner of representation is a fundamental, inherently natural way of conveying ideas that is ageless and universal.
        Types of Drawing
        There are mainly two types of drawing;
            Artistic Drawing.
            Technical or Engineering Drawing.
        The Definition of Engineering Drawing
        A graphical language that engineers and other technical members associated with the engineering profession use to thoroughly and precisely express the specifications for engineered objects are known as an engineering drawing. It is a representation of a three-dimensional item in two dimensions.
        In other words, engineering drawing is the process of accurately portraying a real or imagined object utilising some graphics, symbols, characters, and numbers with the aid of engineering drawing tools.
        Engineers and technologists use it. An engineering drawing contains all the details regarding the objectls size, shape, type of surface, materials, etc. For example, circuit diagrams for electrical and electronics engineers, building drawings for civil engineers, machine drawings for mechanical engineers, computer graphics for everyone, et
        Feeler Gauge
        Instruments for Drawing
        The most common instruments used for engineering drawing are:
            1. Drawing board (Approximately 20" x 20"), drafting table, or desk.
            T-square (24", transparent edge)
            Set of instruments
            450 triangle (8" side)
            300 x600 triangle (10" long side)
            Irregular curve
            Pencils (2B, FIB, 31-1)
            Protractor
            Eraser
            Dusting brush
            Drafting tape
            Circle and ellipse templates.
            ow to Read Drawings
            An engineer must be able to tell what an engineering drawing is portraying drawn by another engineer. This is known as reading a drawing. To read drawing, one must understand how engineers use lines, dimensions, and notes
            You can see that each line has special importance that you must comprehend to accurately interpret a drawing. Let's talk about some of the most significant types.
            Lines
                A visible line—also referred to as an object line, is used to indicate an item's edges that are visible to the viewer.
                Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
                Often, some lines are drawn on the exposed surfaces of a section drawing. These are section lines and are used to display various types of materials.
                Dimensions
                Engineers use lines to describe an object's form or shape, but they use dimensions to express its full size. There are two different kinds of dimensions used in drawings: size and location.
                A size dimension displays an object's or a fraction of an object's size, as suggested by their names, and a location dimension describes the placement of features. The adjacent figure displays examples of both size and

        Three Dimensional Drawing
        Isothermic Drawing
        An isometric drawing is the illustration of the object in the image. The term "pictorial drawings" refers to the family of three-dimensional perspectives. 
        The width and depth planes' horizontal lines in an isometric drawing are represented at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, while the object's vertical lines are drawn vertically. 
        The lines parallel to these three axes are drawn using these rules and are drawn at their true (scale) lengths. A line will not be its actual length if it is not parallel to these axes.
        "Assembly" Drawings
        Pillow-block Image
        The first image is an isometric view of a pillowblock bearing system that has been assembled. It closely matches what you see when looking at the thing from a specific angle. 
        From this angle, it is impossible to determine how the part looks on the inside
        We can also show isometric views of the pillow block being taken apart or disassembled in this next image.
        This allows you to see the inner components of the bearing system, Isometric drawings can show the overall arrangement clearly but not the details and dimensions
        Disassembled Pillow-block
        A cross-sectional view portrays a cut-away portion of the object and is another way to show hidden components in a device.
        Imagine a plane that cuts vertically through the centre of the pillow block, as shown in the figure above. 
        Then imagine removing the material from the front of this plane, as shown in the figure belo
        Correlations of Lengths and Diameters
        The correlations of lengths and diameters are better seen in this orthogonal cross-sectional view (section A-A, figure on the right). Compared to isometric drawings, these drawings are simpler to produce. It takes some time, but experienced engineers can read orthogonal designs without requiring an isometric drawing. 
        The top "outside" view of the bearing is shown in the figure on the right. It is an orthogonal (perpendicular) projection. Notice the direction of the arrows for the "A-A" cutting plane.
        Drawing Tools
        Both manual drafting tools (figure below) and computer-aided drafting or design, or CAD, can be used to create drawings. No matter what design tool you choose to make the drawings, the fundamental drawing standards and practices are the same. 
        We shall approach learning about drafting from the standpoint of manual drafting. A freehand sketch is a drawing that was created without the use of any tools or CAD software.
        Lesson Summary
            Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set.
            Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal.
            Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage, and high amperage.
            Oxygene and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals. The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200 degrees C.
            Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item.
             The most common instruments used for engineering drawing include; drawing board, protractor, eraser, drafting tape, T-square, irregular curve, etc.
            Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
            One of the issues of three-dimensional drawing is that it is often difficult or sometimes almost impossible to draw the interior details of the inside of an object.

        Learning Outcomes
        After completing this module, you will be able to:
            Explain slab centring, beam reinforcements, and beam arrangements in building technology
            Identify the positive and negative bending moments that act on beam reinforcements
            Describe the processes used in slab reinforcements
            Discuss the systems for staircase placement, shuttering and reinforcements
            Translate electrical drawings and electric conduit installation diagrams
            Lesson Summary
            The key points from this module are:


            Practical procedure for arranging of beam bottom and slab centring
            The slab centring plates, beam bottom and beam sides will be supported by using wooden or steel props. When a load is placed on the props, the load will be transferred uniformly to the slab.
            The process for placing the slab reinforcements include:
                First step – Shorter horizontal bars are laid first.      Second step – The distribution bars are laid next.
                Third step – involves adding the top extra bar           Fourth step – Mark the crank distance
                Fifth step – Once the crank distance has been marked, a distribution bar will be placed at the centre portion. The bars in the shorter direction would be laid below the bars placed in the longer direction.
            After placing the slab reinforcements, other activities to be carried out at the site include:
            1.   Creating the staircase riser and thread.                      2.   Placing of staircase shuttering and reinforcement

            3. Placing the electrical conduit on the slab                     4.     Placing of plumbing sleeves in sunken slab
            Lesson Summary
            5.   Complete casting of slab and staircase: A sunken slab level is cast lower than the main slab so that the plumbing lines/fittings can be laid inside the sunken slab. The entire length of the slab will be cast in one day.

            6.   Curing of slab at the construction site

            7.   Deshuttering of beam sides, beam bottom and slab centering – After three days of slab casting, the slab centering plates can be removed. The props will be put back in their original position after the slab centering plates are removed. Whereas, the beam bottom will take at least 7 days before removal. The props will also be put back in their original position after the beam bottom has been removed.
            Beam design (beam data and material grades for beam design)
            Single reinforced section – This refers to the practice where reinforcements are provided only at the tension region. The purpose of providing reinforcement here is to hold the stirrups.

            Double reinforced section – If the reinforcement is provided both at the compression and tension regions, it is called a double reinforced section. This reinforcement will take part in load carrying and support of stirrups.
            The bending moment of a beam: When the shear force is at maximum value, the bending moment will be zero. Whereas, where the bending moment is zero, the shear force will be at maximum value.
            Learning Outcomes
            After completing this module, you will be able to:
                Indicate the safety practice from the design and construction points of view
                Highlight the importance of the bill of quantities in structural engineering projects
                Discuss the importance and application of the general notes in structural drawings
                Lesson Summary
                The key points from this module are as follows:

                Safety from the construction point of view
                ●  For a structural engineer, safety comes before economy. While working at a site, safety is the first priority.

                ●  While working at heights, always wear safety belts.

                Outline the building construction process with practical demonstrations and examples
        Lesson Summary
        Safety from the design point of view will consider:
            The major failures of buildings occur due to construction failure and not a design failure.
            We consider enough factors of safety (FOS) for concrete and steel.
            We overestimate the load coming on the building and underestimate the strength of the material.
            Consider the load factor of safety and the material factor of safety.
            Consideration of the safe bearing capacity of the soil.
            The consideration of the size of footing, column dimensions, etc.
        A building is categorized into substructure and superstructure.
        Substructure - The part of the building below ground level, like the PCC, footing and column, up to the plinth level.
        Superstructure - The part of the building that is above ground level e.g., ground floor column, ground floor roof, first-floor beam, etc.

                                            Lesson Summary
                                            Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                Arrangement questions make use of factorials. A factorial is displayed as: 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24
                                                To find the expected value you can multiply the chance of a certain outcome against the outcome and add that all together.
                                                There are 3 separate definitions for calculating the probability of simple events. The classical definition (equal likelihood methods) is used when there is an equal probability of any item happening (rolling a die), the relative frequency definition is used when you have to experiment multiple times to calculate the probability and the subjective definition is used when you have to take a guess at the outcome (sports events or elections).
                                                When finding whether events are independent you can this of it as the probability of both events is equal to the probability of one events happening tims the other or P(CnB) = P(C) x P(B).
                                                A tree diagram is used to visually display all possible outcomes when calculating probability. Working backwards along a tree diagram is also known as Bayes’ Theorem.
                                                The sum of all possible probabilities must always equal a positive 1. To find the mean value of the experiment is to add up each possible outcome that is mul
                                                Lesson Summary
                                                Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                    Normal distributions are shown as symmetrical with the equally likely probability of events happening. Positive distributions are skewed to the left and negative distributions are skewed to the right. The probability of being within one standard deviation of the mean is 68%.
                                                    Binomial distributions always work with 2 possible outcomes. You can work with outcomes that are either dependent on the previous outcome or independent events.
                                                    When given the number of trials and a successful outcome in an exam question you can determine that you are being asked about binomial distribution, questions will rarely plainly say they are asking about binomials. In Microsoft Excel, you can use the built-in functions to calculate the probabilities and mean of binomial outcomes.
                                                    Cumulative frequency (CF) is used when you want to group things together, like lengths of cucumbers. CF is always found on the y-axis. When plotting the CF the line that you can draw to show the increase is referred to as the ogive curve. You can also use this graph to find the median (also known as the Q2), lower and upper quartiles. With this information, you can then create a box and whisker plot.
                                                    To find the mean of a data set find the sum through addition and divide that total by the number of values in that data set.
                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                    Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                        When finding the frequency of ranges from a histogram you use the frequency destiny, which will also be how to find the area of the shape on the graph.
                                                        In stratified sampling, you look at the population and split them into smaller groups to find the probability. Cluster samples are more like a random sample, here you select a group to sample within the entire population. A quota sample is similar to the cluster sample, but you also want to add a specific group to be tested.
                                                        Studying the relationship between 2 variables is known as correlation. Scatter diagrams can be used to visually inspect the relationship. There are both positive and negative correlations.
                                                        A more precise measure of correlation is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, which is usually represented by an ‘r’. In Microsoft Excel, you can calculate this coefficient using an inbuilt function.
                                                        Any straight line, also known as the line of best fit, has the formula y = ax + b (where a is the gradient of the line and b is the intercept). There should always be a point that is the average of the x data and one that is the average of the y data. Excel has built-in functions to find the equation of this line.
                                                tiplied by the possibility of each outcome.

    Learning Outcomes
    After completing this module, you will be able to:

        Identify the key elements of active listening that improve communication.
        Describe the benefits of effective listening in personal and professional contexts.
        Explain the role of non-verbal cues in building strong communication.
        Outline the ways non-verbal communication influences relationships and career growth

    Lesson Summary
    The following are the key points covered in the module:

        Active listening entailed eye contact, summarizing key points, and assuming an open body position to gain the speaker's perspective. It also involves attention, a lack of distraction, and the reception of verbal and nonverbal messages.
        Active hearing has many benefits, such as learning new things, making connections, understanding, and bonding. To avoid interruption and personal experience, one must make a conscious effort, practice, and train one's focus.
        While informative hearing collects information for judgment, critical listening judges and analyzes information for judgment, appreciative listening is motivated by enjoyment and amusement, and sympathetic listening empathizes and identifies with the speaker's feelings.
        Nonverbal clues, such as body alignment and facial expressions, guide interactions. Being aware of these cues allows for more successful interactions.
        Hand gestures, voice tone, physical touch, posture, and eye contact are essential. Positive cues improve connection and empathy; negative ones might impede communication.
        Improving relational dynamics depends on a self-awareness of nonverbal communication. Learning these signals will enhance confidence and professional contacts.

        Lesson Summary
        The following are the key points covered in the module:
            Emotions can impede successful communication in various ways, including spoken, written, nonverbal, and visual, resulting in potential misinterpretations based on the receiver's perception of words and nonverbal clues.
            The delivery of messages depends on tone and inflexion. Good communication calls for authenticity.
            Detaching the ego helps one avoid "loaded" conversations assigning blame.
            "Unloaded" communication stresses sharing personal emotions free from accusations—that is, "I feel...".
            Unchecked emotions like insecurity and rage can compromise communication efficacy and clarity.
            Understanding how emotions affect ideas and behavior, building self-awareness, and applying self-reflective questions to clarify one's thoughts help one control emotions properly. Furthermore, stopping before significant talks and emphasizing controlling emotional triggers to reach the intended results are crucial.
            Good communication calls for verbal and nonverbal signals, including the conversational emotional tone.
            Understanding unclear or abrupt communication requires an awareness of underlying emotions.
            Giving time for emotions to calm enables more fruitful conversations.
        e shows warmth and captures an audience. Managing difficult circumstances requires awareness of others' nonverbal signals.

            AI is transforming cybersecurity by improving vulnerability identification through faster data processing and pattern recognition than traditional methods.
            Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves collecting and analyzing information on threats, understanding adversaries' tactics, and proactively mitigating risks to protect assets.
            At the heart of AI-driven cyber threat intelligence are machine learning models, categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
            Network security starts with understanding potential threats, which can be categorized as internal or external, deliberate or accidental.
            Network traffic analysis involves the monitoring and examination of network data to detect anomalies, threats, and inefficiencies.
            The evolving nature of cyber threats requires continuous updates to AI models, but the process is resource-intensive and crucial for detecting new attacks.
            AI's data processing ability raises privacy concerns, making careful data handling crucial to prevent misuse and protect individuals' rights.
            Theoretical approaches to ethical AI are fundamental in understanding how artificial intelligence systems can align with human values, norms, and ethical principles.

                Career Progression and Salary
                The career ladder for software engineers differs from company to company. Each level on this ladder is given a different name by the company. For example, a software engineer at Meta starts at E3 and climaxes at E9, while the lowest level in Google is L2 and their highest is L11.
                Level 2 - Internship and Apprenticeship
                When you get an internship, you'll be placed at this level. Many organizations also place their apprentices at this level. Apprentices are people who did not come into tech from the traditional route. They may have gone through a boot camp, learned by themselves, or moved through a path that does not involve a traditional education (a degree). They can also be people who transition into software engineering from a non-tech role. An apprentice would spend about 6 months to a year at L2 before moving to L3.
                An intern is expected to be someone willing to learn and take on assignments. He/she would be assigned a mentor to guide their learning for about 3 to 6 months. When you start as an intern, you should meet with your mentor almost every day for guidance. Don't be surprised if the work you are given is data entry or testing.

                Level 3 - Junior Software Engineer
                These are Junior engineers, usually fresh out of college, boot camp, or self-taught, who are looking for their first real-world experience in a full-time role. They are often required to learn at least one programming language, such as Java, PHP, or Cotlin, and understand the technologies and methodologies associated with that language. They work under the direction of a team lead. A junior engineer is often given small pieces of work that may have little significant impact on a software project - (feature level impact) and may be supervised through their work.

During the 3-6 months you'll work as an intern, the company will evaluate you as though you were a new level 3 enginndustry, build your skills in a practical environment, develop work ethics, and learn when and how to seek help
                Even with this difference in the numbering of each level, the responsibilities they carry and the requirements for promotion are the same. Most companies use a leveling structure similar to Google’s, so the career progression outlined in this topic is based on their model. The career progression discussed here is for individual contributors.

        For instance, they may be given a small feature to implement along with a description of how the feature works, the steps they should take to implement it as well as resources they'll need. As time progresses, perhaps in a year or two, your team would trust you more to build entire features on your own and would not hold your hand as much as when you were new. At this point, depending on the organization, you may need to focus on more than just the feature you're working on. You would consider the software architecture, monitoring the application, and how your code or feature fits with the goals of the project. Note that in this role you will mostly be writing code. If you work in a bigger company, you should expect more handholding and large amounts of resources for any project or task. On the othe

        Introduction
        Many of us can write functional code. We may have learned to do so at a boot camp, taught ourselves, or spent 4 years in university jumping from one project to another. But simply writing code doesn’t make someone a professional software developer—if it did, that would be too easy! So, what separates a hobbyist programmer from a professional one? Software engineering. Anyone can become a software engineer(SWE). Many shy away from this role, “saying it's too complex,” yet others jump into it all the same. Whether you've been in the tech industry or just came in, we developed this course to successfully prepare you for this role.
        As you examine this topic, try to understand:

    What is Software Engineering?
    To the outside world, software engineering seems like a job of just writing code after code and nothing more. In fact, some people even enter this career thinking that's all they'll do—write code. We have Hollywood, of course, to thank for this common misconception. If you have worked in any tech role, you'll notice that your function and responsibilities are not limited to one task, and software engineering is no different. Writing code is just one aspect of it.
    Software engineering is a process used to develop, design, test, and maintain software using standardized methodologies and processes to make sure it meets client goals and requirements. You can think of it as a process to build software systems from scratch to finish. This process, in itself, is ‘Software Engineering’
    Software Engineering Principles - 1
    Modularity
    Professional software engineers build and manage large software systems. To make them easy to scale and manage, they use a principle called ‘modularity.’ Modularity is the practice of breaking down software into smaller parts that can be scaled and maintained independently. This allows engineers to work on one part of the software without affecting the rest.

    Software Engineering Career Paths
    Software engineers are also qualified to work in various other roles in the tech industry. This is as a result of their diverse skill sets. There are multiple career paths you can choose to follow. The exact job opportunities available to a software engineer can vary. They depend on factors like location, area of specialization, and individual skill set. Note that you would not need to stay forever in the role you chose from the onset of your career. For example, if you choose to start out as a front-end engineer, you may decide to switch to the backend. The point to note is that you are not required to spend your whole work life on one career path in software engineering.
    Types of Software Engineers - 1
    Frontend Engineer
    A front end engineer builds and optimizes the user interface (UI) of applications. This means front-end engineers develop and maintain the part of software that users see and interact with, which is often called the ‘client side’ of software. For instance, in the case of YouTube, the interface is the part you see and interact with. (e.g., the subscribe and like button) are designed, positioned, and built by front-end engineers.

    Data Engineer
    A data engineer works on software systems that acquire and use large volumes of data. They build and manage the systems (often called data pipelines) that collect, store and analyze large volumes of data. They make sure that these systems that move data from one place to another within the software are efficient, reliable, and scalable. This allows them to prepare the data for analysis which would enable organizations to make informed high level business decisions.

        Daily Responsibilities of SWEs - 1
        Throughout the software development life cycle, software engineers work on various tasks. The main responsibility of a software engineer is to develop software systems that fulfill client needs and meet business requirements. Oftentimes, the software is complex, so this responsibility is usually divided among teams. The daily responsibilities of software engineers would depend on the team they are deployed in, the project and the organization they work for. But oftentimes, these responsibilities include the following:
        Writing and Testing Code
        Software engineers spend a reasonable part of their day testing code. This involves writing code, improving code quality, fixing issues like bugs, and implementing new features.
        Code Reviews

        Design and Planning
        esponsibilities of SWEs- 2
        Meetings and Collaboration
        Software engineers attend daily meetings with other team representatives to discuss project progress, requirements, or blockers. They also work with cross-functional teams like (1)Product Managers - to align their work with project goals, timelines, and requirements. (2) Designers - to ensure that user interfaces and experiences align with the technical capabilities of the software and are visually appealing. (3)Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers - to test the software and make sure that it meets the required quality, standard, and function.

        Introduction
        In this topic, we’ll consider the professional qualifications and skills you need to become a capable software engineer. It’s important to note that while not all the skills we discuss will be relevant to every software engineering role, they apply to most roles and will make you a more versatile engineer if you develop them. As you examine this topic, try to answer this question for yourself: What technical and interpersonal skills are necessary to become a software enginee
        Your Skills
        As we considered in the previous topic, a software engineer can qualify to work in a plethora of tech positions. Their skill set is what makes this versatility possible. So, what are these skills? There are two layers of skills to note here:
            The skills necessary for the particular subset of software engineering you choose to work in.
            These are the general skills every software engineer must possess.
        For example, a machine learning engineer must have a deep understanding of data science and be proficient in mathematical concepts related to data science. These same skills may not be as important for a front-end engineer whose f
        ard Skills - 1
        Hard skills are technical skills that are learned through education, training, or hands-on experience. They can be measured for proficiency and competency. These skills are necessary for performing the specific tasks required in your role and can be demonstrated through tests and certifications. For a software engineer, the essential hard skills include the following:
        Programming Languages
        Learning how to code is likely the first technical skill that comes to mind—it’s the bedrock of software engineering.
        This skill is critical because it enables you to create software, make informed decisions, guide the technical aspects of projects in the right direction, lead code reviews, and mentor team members.
        You don’t need to master every language out there; being proficient in at least one is enough. The four most commonly used languages in software engineering are Python, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS (though technically not a programming language, it’s essential for presenting UI to users).
        Data Structures and Algorithms


        Version Control Basics (Git, GitHub/GitLab)
        Hard Skills - 2
        Database Knowledge (SQL, NoSQL)
        When building software, you'll often deal with unorganized data stored in databases.
        To properly manage this data, you'll need to understand how databases work—how to structure, retrieve, and store data efficiently. SQL is the most popular language for organizing such data, while NoSQL offers alternative approaches for unstructured data.
        Testing and Debugging



        Software Development Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Waterfall)


        Knowledge of Development Tools and Ecosystems






        Containers
        Building Hard Skills
        So now you know these skills. How can you build them? One effective way to develop hard skills is by solving creative coding challenges. You can find such challenges on platforms like:
            Advent of Code
            Codewars
            LeetCode
            HackerRank
            Exercism
        Start practicing, and you’ll see yourself improving in no time!
        Soft Skills - 1
        Soft skills are behavioral and interpersonal skills that determine how you relate to people in your workplace. Unlike hard skills, they’re not easily measured and are largely influenced by your personality. These skills are necessary to build a safe, productive, and collaborative work environment. Here are the top soft skills every software engineer should develop:
        Problem-Solving
        Your ability to solve problems is essential in every aspect of software engineering. You'll find yourself face to face with problem after problem, both technical and non-technical, such as Deadlines, Customer requirements, Bugs, Broken code, and Miscommunication
        It is important to develop the skill to approach problems thoughtfully and curate the most appropriate solutions for each one. Problem-solving is so valuable that it’s often tested during job interviews and techn
        Soft Skills - 2
        Attention to Detail
        Software engineering requires precision. You'll need to pay attention to what you do from coding and testing to debugging and documenting—every detail matters.
        Paying attention to detail minimizes mistakes and ensures accuracy in your work. Remember that computers only understand you when you tell them precisely what to do.

        Certifications and Degrees
        The traditional way to become a software engineer is to get a degree. But today, many software engineers are self-taught. Regardless of the route you choose, you’ll need a way to demonstrate your skills to employers. Certifications and degrees serve as formal proof of your expertise. You can gain these certifications and qualifications through a number of ways. These include:
            Boot camps
            Apprenticeship programs
            Professional certification programs
            University degrees
        As you examine this topic, consider these questions:
            What certifications do I need to possess?
            Should I get a degree for this role?
            Will this role be a good fit for my personality and aspirations?
            Is a Degree Necessary?
            The short answer is No! But when you look deeper, you'll see that it depends on (1) Your location. (2) The company you want to work for. For example, some companies prefer people who have a bachelor's or master's over someone who is self-taught or went through a boot camp, but these are not the majority. Most companies, though, don’t really care about your educational background as much as your skills and practical experience—your ability to do the work. Before drafting your personal learning and certification path, it’s important to research the qualifications required by the company you aim to work for. The main purpose of a degree or certification is to verify your skills and qualifications. Understanding what’s valued by your target employers will guide your decisions. In the following pages, we’ll explore each of these routes in detail.
            chelor's Degree - 1
            An undergraduate degree is one of the most common routes to becoming a software engineer. Even though it’s not required by many organizations for entry-level positions, it can give you an edge over other candidates. Some employers require candidates to hold a bachelor’s degree for specific roles to demonstrate their ability, skills, and experience in building complex systems. For senior-level positions like Lead Engineer or Senior Developer, a bachelor’s degree is often a minimum requirement.
            Bachelor's Degree - 2
            For a career in software engineering, you can pursue a bachelor’s degree in any computing-related field, such as:
                Computer Science
                Software Engineering
                Mathematics
                Data Science or Data Analytics
                Computer Engineering
            This degree involves studying one or two subjects in great detail over four (4) years of full-time study. In software engineering, your coursework would include:
                Programming

            A master’s degree can help advance your career in software engineering, but it’s not necessary. It can be used to:
                Progress to higher positions within an organization.
                Negotiate a higher salary.
                Simplify the hiring process when transitioning between organizations.
            However, it’s important to note that your skills and experience are the major players that will help you progress in this career, not your academic qualifications. Only a few organizations require a postgraduate degree, like a master’s, for higher-level positions. Ultimately, a master’s degree can give you some benefits, yet it’s not required.

        Level 5 - Senior Software Engineer
        If you spent anywhere from 3-7 years as a software engineer you most likely would be in this position. This is a terminal role, which means that your company would no longer expect you to keep climbing the career ladder unless you want to. You can spend the rest of your career at this level. Some individuals move over to a managerial position from here; either way, it's not a requirement. The work you do now would have a team-level impact. What does this mean? To explain, let's go back to that authentication server, the team handling that project might be the ‘payment infrastructure team’ and they would often have other projects on their hands like the transaction fee engine, the ledger and so on. Your role here is to technically lead the entire team. You'll have to examine the architectu
        Level 6 - Staff SWE
        If you've been in this industry for about 7 - 10 years, you are probably a staff-level software engineer. This is also the next level after senior software engineers and where most engineers peak in their careers. This role has an organizational-level impact. What does this mean? The authentication server we mentioned previously is managed by the payment infrastructure team, which is led by a senior software engineer. Other technical teams manage other financial products in the organization, such as the payment and subscription teams. You would collectively manage all these teams.

    Job Hunting
    There are many ways to get your first role as a software engineer. The kind of job you'll get would depend on your location, experience and sometimes your education. Most people who have earned a degree go for internships, which they can use to transition into a full-time role later on. Other engineers who are self-taught or graduated from a boot camp may directly apply to an entry-level position or start freelancing to build their portfolios. Either way, there are a lot of strategies you can use to secure a role regardless of the position you are gunning for. From this topic till the end of this course, we'll discuss the following:

        How to find a software engineering job
        How to get an interview
        How to write your resume and build your portfolio
        Preparing for the Job Search - 1
        Many people would be eager to jump into the job market and start applying for jobs, but that won't get you the best results. First, you need to understand what you're getting into, so you need to research the job market. This will allow you to put yourself in your employer's shoes to know what companies are currently looking for and how to tailor your application to their needs. To do this, look at listings on job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and AngelList. Each job posting you see would normally have listed requirements for each applicant, e.g., years of experience, proficiency in a list of languages and technologies, certifications, or soft skills relevant to the role.

    Industries That Hire SWEs
    Where would you like to work, Google, Microsoft, Meta or Apple? These are the goto choice for many engineers. But there are alot of other industries and companies you can work for. Some of them are easier to get into than big tech.
    Tech Startups
    These guys are on the lookout for employees that can help the company achieve its goal. To that end, you'll rarely hear of a startup asking for your certifications and degrees. Rather, they are more interested in your ability to solve real-world problems with your technical and soft skills, whether you're self-taught or a degree holder. You can prove your worth to a startup by using projects in your portfolio. We'll discuss how to build a portfolio that's attractive to employers down the line.

    Your Resume
    A recruiter would spend about 7 seconds skimming through your resume. At that time, s/he would decide if it was worth paying more attention to or casting aside. Today, many recruiting organizations use software to decide whether or not a resume is worth looking at. This software often filters out 60% of resumes. So, it is important for your resume to stand out. We'll discuss how to structure and write each part of your resume to make yours stand out. Some general points to note are:

        First, make sure your structure flows. Don’t complicate things—keep it simple, neat, and consistent. No fancy fonts or colors; just black and white is enough. Stick to what matters and avoid distractions.
        Use numbers for accomplishments. They make things clear. Show how much you’ve done and improved. If you've boosted retention, say by how much. It's all about the action. If you increase something, give a percentage. Don't hide behind words; show results.
        For education and skills, don't get caught up in dates or proficiency levels. They don’t matter here. It’s about what you can do, not how long you’ve been doing it or how good you think you are.
        Keep it short, using action verbs. It should be no more than
        Professional Online Presence
        You'll need an online presence in this career, not just to land your first role but to place you in a position of authority in the field. It also allows other people to see your level of skill and dedication to your work. Today, many software engineers have secured tech positions simply by having an active online presence. So, how and where can you build one? We'll discuss three platforms. In addition to these platforms, you should join developer communities on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Slack. Members of these communities who share project progress and quality content consistently have been known to receive job offers.
        one page. Only include what adds value to the bigger picture.
        Professional Online Presence
        X (Formerly Twitter)
        First, create an account and follow the people you would like to hire. In your bio, make it transparent that you are on a journey to land your first job in the tech industry. Then, you can begin commenting on other people's tweets with encouragement and positivity. This would make people see you as really nice, and many would follow you because they want to see you succeed on your journey. 
        Once you’ve got some eyes on you, start making meaningful contributions and posts. Make threads about anything you Learn(make it clean and useful). 
        LinkedIn 

        Github
        Portfolio-Building
        Before you can get employed by a company, you'll need to prove that you can do the job. This goes beyond your certifications. You'll need to find a way to showcase your abilities in practice. A portfolio would help you do just that. So, to define it, a portfolio is a piece of document or material that showcases your work in practice. For software engineers, this is best done with a website.
        ortfolio Website
        Image by Freepik
        Image by Freepik
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates. You can develop a website that will link its visitors to projects you may have worked on or contributed to. It should also include projects hosted on your GitHub or anywhere else. Once your portfolio website is set up, you can also add projects that demonstrate your use of languages you're proficient in, internships, awards and certifications you may have received
        Keep it simple and let the content speak for itself.

    Projects on Your Portfolio - 1
    How do you get projects to put on your portfolio? Oftentimes, most engineers work on solo projects like a budget app, cooking app, student study aid, or similar software. But if you want to stand out, you should showcase paid projects you have worked on and successfully completed—projects that actually generated revenue. You can get projects like this through freelancing. This is where you offer your services for a fee to the public. When you work on a project for a client, you may add it to your list of projects along with the revenue it generated for the client in specified numbers. Spice it up by stating the challenges for each project, as well as your thought processes and methodologies for overcoming those challenges to achieve the desired result.
    Projects on Your Portfolio - 2
    As a suggestion, you can add these two projects to your portfolio:

        A website where you can log in to an account and do something with it, like upload a picture or video or send a message. Most companies have software that allows users to log in and do something on their account. Working on this kind of project would prepare you to work on software like this on a large scale.
        Another project to work on is using external APIs, such as incorporating Google Maps into a project or using web sockets for real-time messaging apps.

    Finding Job Opportunities
    When job hunting, most people would first hit listings on job boards. It can be a challenge to stand out from the thousands of daily applications on each post. If you decide to use this method, filter for the most recent posting before applying. However, there is a much better way to get job offers—real-life networking. This is where you meet people and talk with them face to face, not on the Internet. Online interactions cannot replace the magic of face-to-face conversations. In fact, most high-quality business contacts come from physical interactions with people.
    How to Network
    One way to network is through meetups. Apps like ‘meetup’ allow you to meet with other programmers in your locality, connect with them, and eat free pizza. There, you might meet someone who would help you down your career. Another popular way to network is to attend conferences. This is usually more expensive but can get you high-quality connections.
    Before attending an event, practice small talk and self introduction

    Email Outreach
    One very effective way to get a software engineering job is to directly contact an individual in the company you wish to work for. Preferably, the person you contact should have decision-making power. To do this, send a direct email letting them know you are interested in working with their organization or company.
    Here is how to structure your email: THE INTRO The first part of your email should break the ice and build some form of rapport with him/her. It should notify the receiver that you have done some research about their company and that the email would not be a waste of their time. To do this effectively, you'll need to find a way to personalize it to them and what they're working on. You can't achieve this without researching the company and individual.
    You could say: “Hey (Name), Absolutely love what you're doing with/on [project they're currently working on]. I checked you [the main technology, tool, or structure they're trying to ach
    Passing Technical Interviews (PTI)
    Below are some tips to pass software engineering technical interviews:

        It is normal to get anxious when you are given a question or challenge to solve. You can reduce your anxiety by focusing on the problem preserved in the question itself rather than whether you impress the interviewer or the stakes at hand.
        To help you calm down and process the question, read them aloud to the interviewer. Start with writing pseudo code. It'll help you break down the problem into something simpler.
        Take your time to understand the requirements, so you don't waste your time writing code you would have to change later. You could ask clarifying questions like: “am I allowed to use this library?”
        Think aloud and explain the reasoning behind your decisions throughout your process. If this is a challenge for you, practice self-talk while you code privately to be comfortable with it before the interview date.
        Everyone gets stuck somewhere while coding. The way you react to roadblocks determines whether you get an offer or not. You can do either of these two things: (1) You may ask the interviewer for clarification for uncertainty, e.g., I think I'm on the right track if I know that X will cause Y outcome, which is not desirable. How do I prevent that? (2) You can always skip an issue and come back to it later.
        DON'T CHEAT!
        Avoid language-specific magic and use modulo operations instead, as it is found in most languages. Smile and speak clearly and confidently. If acceptable in your region, a sprinkle of casualty can help loosen the tension.

    PTI Continuation - The Big O Notation
    Big O Notation is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its performance or resource use as the size of the input grows. During the your technical interview, it's a prompt to remind you that you might need to:
    Understand Time Complexity
    Be prepared to discuss how long your solution takes to run as the input size increases. For example:
    O(1) means constant time (very fast).
    O(n) means linear time (grows with the input size).
    O(n^2) means quadratic time (much slower for larger inputs).
    Understand Space Complexity
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 1
    Topics You'll Be Tested On
    If you're applying to companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (shortened as FAANG), you'll be confronted with problems around Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming. Certain regions will answer your questions on dynamic programming. Other types of companies, e.g., banks, might give your take-home tests or behavior-style coding interview questions. 
    It is important for you to research the interview process for your company of choice to get a better idea of what to expect. 
    Choice of Language
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 2
    Data Structures 
    There are a handful of data structures you should have a basic understanding of before the interview; these are Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Sets, Maps, Linked Lists, Trees (binary search trees), and Graphs. You should also learn the purpose of each of these structures, their common use cases, their time complexity using Big O notation, and all the different operations like adding and subtracting elements when you should and should not use them, their pros and cons, and how to implement them.

    Lesson Summary
    In this module, you have learned the following:

        The career ladder for software engineers is as follows: Level 2 - Internship and Apprenticeship, Level 3 - Junior Software Engineer, Level 4 - Software Engineer, Level 5 - Senior Software Engineer, Level 6 - Staff software engineer, Level 7 - Senior Staff Software Engineering, Level 8+ Principal Software Engineer, Level 9 Distinguished Software Engineer and level 10 Google Fellow
        The industries that hire software engineers include Gaming and Entertainment, Retail and E-commerce, the healthcare industry, financial institutions like banks, and Tech Startups.
        The structure of your resume should be as follows: The Header(this should have your name), Contact Details (email address (use a professional email if you have one), phone number, LinkedIn and GitHub.), Education, Experience (For your list of experiences you may use the ‘XYZ’ Google formatting: I used X to accomplish Y that had Z results.) Projects (Include their timeframe, the challenges you overcame, and the results they got). The last section on your resume should be about your technical skills.
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates.
        Most engineers work on solo projects like budget apps, cooking apps, student study aids, or similar software.

            Platforms like LeetCode and Algoexpert would give you a plethora of technical questions to solve. As you approach each question from easy to hard, note that the goal is not to memorize the solutions but to build your problem-solving and pattern-recognition skills.
            If you're applying to companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (shortened as FAANG), you'll be confronted with problems around Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.
            During the technical interview, the interviewer may ask, "What's the time complexity of your solution?" or "Can you optimize this algorithm to make it faster?" So, practice explaining the efficiency of your code in Big O term

                Outline the platforms and technologies used in Next-generation sequencing (NGS).
                Summarize the steps for interpreting pathway analysis results.
                esson Summary
                    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the sequencing of entire genomes from single cells or from entire organisms. It has enabled us to identify and measure genetic variation, enabling us to better understand the genetic basis of diseases and other biological processes.
                    Pathway analysis is often used in conjunction with other bioinformatics techniques such as gene expression profiling, and metabolomics.
                    Network analysis and control theory uses mathematical models to study the behavior of networks. These models are used to identify and analyze network parameters, such as topology, traffic flow, and routing.
                    There are several types of machine learning used in bioinformatics, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with supervised learning being the most common type of machine learning used in bioinformatics.
                    Clinical bioinformatics is used to identify, measure, and compare clinical features in order to make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
                    Integrating clinical laboratory data into a healthcare system requires the implementation of an electronic health record (EHR). An EHR is a digital record of a patient’s health information that can be accessed by healthcare providers from any location.
                    Lesson Summary
                        Biomedical engineering is a multifaceted discipline bridging medicine, biology, and engineering, dedicated to enhancing healthcare and quality of life.
                        Ethical considerations such as patient consent and data security, are pivotal as engineers navigate advancements like genetic engineering and AI in healthcare.
                        The most significant challenge of sequence alignment and database searching is the sheer amount of data that must be compared. With millions of sequences that need to be compared and analyzed, the process can be time-consuming and computationally intensive.
                        Protein structure prediction is an important task in the field of bioinformatics. The ability to accurately predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is important for understanding protein function and for drug discovery.
                        Phylogenetic analysis is an important tool for understanding evolutionary relationships between species and for identifying their relatedness.
                        There are a variety of techniques available for analyzing gene expression. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the research question and the type of data needed

            Symptoms of Dementia
            SYMPTOMS
            TREATABLE
            It is important that care workers are familiar with the symptoms of dementia, as an early diagnosis of the condition may decrease it’s severity over the longer term.
            The symptoms of dementia are outlined below:
             
            - Decline in memory, thinking and reasoning. 
            - Changes in personality, mood and behavior.
            - Difficulties in the ability to communicate, to recognize people and places and to engage in activities.
            - Forgetfulness - forgetting names and appointments.
            - Difficulties with once-familiar activities.
            - Impaired judgment.
            - Problems with spatial and temporal orientation.
            Types of Dementia
            ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
            Alzheimer’s is by far the most common type of dementia, attributed to  approximately 2/3 of cases. It was first identified 100 years ago.
            The onset of Alzheimer’s can be slow and subtle, followed by a gradual decline. Changes in short term memory are noticeable, i.e. memory of recent events. This is typically the primary first complaint.

            Those at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer’s include:
            The Elderly - there is an increased risk after the age of 65. By age 85 or more, there is an almost 50% risk of acquiring the disease.
            Females - females are at a greater risk of contracting the disease than males.

            Genetics - if there is a genetic history of Alzheimer’s in the family, there is a greater risk of developing the disease.

        he Stages of Alzheimer's Disease
        STAGE ONE
        STAGE TWO
        STAGE THREE
        The early stage of Alzheimer's Disease usually lasts two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawing from activities. If these symptoms are recognized and diagnosed at an early stage, it can save both the individual and their families time and hardship.
        During this stage you can expect the person with Alzheimer’s to forget experiences, rather than details (like names). The person may need minor assistance or reminders, but may be able to live alone competently. Efforts to hide confusion from others (the person usually knows something is not right) are sometimes successful at this early stage
        Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain. Symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss.
        This is similar to Alzheimer’s disease, but characterized more often by early changes in movement or the development of extra pyramidal symptoms. This includes: tremors; tics; rigidity; shuffling; gait, which can make individuals look like they have Parkinson’s disease.

        Alertness and severity of cognitive symptoms may fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis. There is often a poor tolerance to medications, as well as autonomic nervous system dysfunction. An example would be wild swings in blood pressure.
        Lewy body dementia can be challenging to diagnose because of it’s similarities to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

        Conclusion
        GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
        When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it is administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. The administration of medication should be tailored to the individual. 

        Carers should constantly be aiming to identify links between certain behaviors and medications. Carers should employ strategies that do not require medications. Medications can and should be considered when such strategies are ineffective or not effective enough. 
        RISKS & BENEFITS
        Carers need to remember the importance of limiting the number of medications administered to patients and monitor which medications patients react well to and which ones they react poorly to. 

        It is important to provide medication in a slow and infrequent manner, because elderly people do not tolerate medications as well as younger people.
        Avoid medications with undesirable side effects, those which can cause more confusion or sedation, or worsen a patient's condition.
        Introduction to The Philosophy of Dementia Care
        INTRODUCTION
        RIGHTS
        This unit is designed to provide an overview of the philosophy and values of good dementia care based on the following concepts:
        A. People are unique and bring to the caregiving situation different perspectives and needs that shape the care environment.
        B. The essence of good Dementia care is the maintenance and enhancement of personhood within this environment. This approach to caring involves having respect for the personhood of those who have Dementia. This includes the equal respect for the personhood of those doing the work of caregiving.
        Care workers need to recognize that clients who have Dementia need to be treated the same as a client who has a broken hip. This unit will allow you to see clients who have Dementia as the patients that they really are.  
        This section focuses on medications that have been proven to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s. 
        COGNITIVE
        Aricept, Exelon, Razadyne: Indicated for mild dementia; used throughout the course of the disease. Side effects are mainly gastro-intestinal (GI) in nature, minimized by giving in the morning with food. There may also be vivid dreams or leg cramps.
        Namenda: Indicated for moderate dementia, used either alone or together with one of three medications previously noted.
        MOOD
        Antidepressants of the class known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally used. They address depression and anxiety. Medications such as tricyclics (for example, Elavil) and benzodiazepines (such as Lorazepam or Valium) should not be used because of the potential for increased confusion and dizziness and the increased risk of falls with potential injury.
        TREATMENTS B.
        The Condition of Alzheimer's Disease
        BEHAVIOURS
        EMOTIONS
        SLEEP/DELIRIUM
        When you work with a client who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (at any stage), it is important to know that their behavior can be unpredictable.
        This is often a response to discomfort, an unmet need, and increasing confusion. Patients also develop an increase in difficulty communicating, progressive loss of independence and poor insight and judgment.

        Key to reducing behavioral disturbances is to identify triggers. These include: pain; fatigue; acute illness; sensory deficits; hallucinations and/or delusions.
        Behaviors may be psychomotor (pacing, wandering, repeatedly crying out, etc.); verbal (belligerence, nastiness towards others, repetitiveness) and/or physical (combativeness, inappropriate touching). Careworkers need to be aware of these types of behaviors which can be expected from their clients. 
        Promoting a Caring Culture
        CARE CULTURE 1
        CARE CULTURE 2
        The new culture (N) of Dementia care outlined below, describes how care workers should go about their work when working with clients who have Dementia. Note how it contrasts with the old culture (O).
        O1: Dementias are diseases of the central nervous system. Personality and identity are destroyed.
        N1: Dementing illness should be seen as a form of disability. How a person is 
        affected depends on the care received.

        O2: The people with the best knowledge are doctors and brain scientists.
        N2: The people with the best knowledge are skilled and insightful caregivers.
        O3: Research is focused on a medical breakthrough. Until that comes, there is not much we can do for the person with Dementia.
        N3: There is a great deal we can do through human caring, insight and skill. This is the most urgent matter for research.

        ADJUSTING
        CAREGIVING
        The purpose of this unit is to discuss the realities of working with the families and friends of the client with Dementia and to determine methods for assisting families cope.
        Watching someone progress through the stages of Alzheimer’s or other dementia is very stressful. Also, there may be guilt associated with the inability to “do more to help the person.” When working with the families of a client, it is important to remember the following:
        - Family members adjust to the client's condition in unique, individual ways.


        - The process of adjustment involves grief and loss - anticipatory grief, i.e. grieving before death occurs.
        As a caregiver you need to be aware of people's attitudes - personal biases, prejudices and stereotypes. 

        Understanding different values and being aware of cultural differences, where it's applicable, will make you a better carer.

        Where necessary, try to get information about the patient’s culture/preferences. Make sure you adapt the care to fit their preferences and demands. Diversity includes race, ethnicity (culture), nationality, religion (or none) and sexual orientation.
        At times, it can be quite difficult for care workers to empathize with a patient with Dementia. Let’s take some time to complete this exercise that could help you see Dementia from a different perspective.

        Imagine a future in which you are in your seventies or eighties and suffering from Dementia. None of your family is able to care for you at home and you have moved into residential care. In the present, you know yourself and your personal history very well. Use your knowledge about yourself as you are now to pick out the information which would help the people who care for you in this imaginary future to maintain your well-being as far as possible. What would you need to sustain your well-being?
        QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
        1.  Everyday tastes and habits: How could it help you feel more settled if your caregivers knew about them?
        2.  Your body and your health: What should they know?
        3.  Fears and past events - If they understood these, could they respond more sympathetically?
        4.  Interests and activities - How can they help you sustain your sense of independence?
        5.  Still thinking of you as an older person with dementia: What do you most dread? What is your greatest hope?
        RULES A.
        Acknowledging the Experiences of Family Members
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES A.
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES B.
        Family members can react in unique and individual ways when a loved one is diagnosed with Dementia. The most common reactions are outlined below:

        DENIAL: Reflects the initial response that nothing is wrong. Denial is a natural reaction; can prevent a family from seeking help; can create family conflict. Helpful Interventions: Provide accurate information on Dementia when appropriate; Listen without judging; Do not assume person is in denial. There may be a lack of information amongst family members.

        OVER INVOLVEMENT: The primary caregiver may try to meet all the needs of the person with memory loss and refuse help from everyone; caregiver believes they are helping; can create a barrier to getting further help. Helpful Interventions: Involve family member in care and care planning; Encourage family member to express painful feelings such as guilt, loss and anger.

        ANGER: Resulting from the physical, emotional, financial burden of providing care. Can stem from feelings of loss and abandonment. Angry feelings can cause guilt. Helpful Interventions: Discuss anger at the disease rather than at people. Encourage interaction with other families going through the experience. Listen without judging or taking sides. Encourage caregiver to take some time for his/her self.
        Lesson Summary

            Dementia refers to a spectrum of brain disorders, involving difficulty with memory and thinking; symptoms vary in their causes, courses and prognoses.
            Symptoms of Dementia include: decline in memory, thinking and reasoning; change in personality, mood and behavior; difficulty communicating, recognizing people and places and engaging in activities.
            Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of Dementia. It is progressive and irreversible. Early diagnosis and recognition of symptoms is important for care.
            When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it should be administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. 
            Vascular or Multi-Infarct Dementia, is the second most common form of Dementia, estimated to account for approx. 20% of cases. It is caused by reduced blood flow to parts of the brain, often due to tiny strokes which block small arteries.
            Fronto-Temporal Dementia causes personality and behavioral changes and loss of language function. 
            Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain; symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss. The early stage lasts for two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawal from activities. The middle stage is characterized by increase in memory loss, confusion, shorter attention span, increase in language difficulties and repetitiveness. The late stage is a period of severe confusion and loss of all functional skills; the person has no awareness of their condition. This lasts for approx. 1-3 years and ends in death.
            Caregivers (professional or family members), must take steps to safeguard their own health and well-being when caring for

            Effective Approaches
            INTRODUCTION
            APPROACH
            This unit is designed to provide guidelines for communicating with the person with Alzheimer’s Disease. This unit expands on the culture of care section and suggests practical applications for handling communication by using the “soft approach” and redirecting the person with Dementia, where possible, to produce a more positive interaction.
            In communicating with the person with Dementia, you will need to:
            - Introduce yourself by name/association.
            - Validate responses and feelings verbally.
            - Use short simple sentences.
            - Ask primarily yes/no questions.
            - Allow time for responses.
            Verbal and Non-Verbal Techniques
            VERBAL
            NON-VERBAL
            In the early, and for part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person with Dementia. They allow you to redirect the person to achieve a more positive interaction.
            Consider the following example. The client says:
            Scenarios: Self-Reflection Exercise
            COMMUNICATION SCENARIO A.
            The following scenarios represent situations that will allow you to consider the communication techniques necessary when treating clients with Dementia. 
            CASE SCENARIO ONE: Margaret at Bedtime
            Laurie was assigned to assist Margaret with getting ready for bed. Margaret was accustomed to putting her nightgown on by herself and was very shy about being undressed. Laurie knocked on the door and entered Margaret’s room to assist her. She found Margaret had put her nightgown on over her clothes. Laurie didn’t think that Margaret would be comfortable sleeping in her clothes, so she wanted to convince Margaret to take off the nightgown. Margaret resisted and Laurie began using a hands-on approach to help her. Since Margaret’s ability to communicate is moderately impaired and she was unable to express her fears and frustration, she became increasingly agitated. She tried to tell Laurie that she was shy and embarrassed, but could not verbalize her feelings and instead pushed Laurie away and threw the nightgown on the floor.


            QUESTIONS:
            (a) What would you do to help Margaret cope with her escalating behavior, help restore her dignity and provide assistance in getting ready for bed?
            (b) Think about this scenario and determine which communication
            “My mother is coming to get me.” If you said, “No, your mother died years ago,” the client would either begin to grieve for her or refuse to believe what you are saying. Instead try something like: “You must miss her. What kind of work did she do?” or “What things did you enjoy doing together?”
            These statements allow the client to respond to the idea of the lost person and go with the flow of the ideas. Direct the client to think about positive memories of the person, rather than the idea that their mother is no longer aliv

            - Use word cues - try to guess what the person want

        Communicating with Colleagues
        If you are providing care to a patient with Dementia in a formal setting (i.e working for a care agency), chances are that you administer care to your patient with the support of at least one of your colleagues. It is vital to maintain a professional and healthy relationship with your colleagues. If you fail to do so, it will effect the standard of care you can provide to your patient. 
        Follow the tips outlined below in order to maintain a healthy relationship with your colleagues:
        Maintain good eye contact.
        Speak clearly and directly.
        Use the person’s name whenever possible.
        Use a friendly tone of voice. 
        Ask for repetition or clarification if you are unclear about a message. 	Never yell or discuss client care in front of that client or other people
        Carefully report critical information related to a client's achievements and challenges.
        Take notes when a
        Teamwork
        It is important to remember that one person cannot administer care to a person with Dementia. It takes a team. This team will not always be a formal team consisting of coworkers. It can also consist of family members or friends. 
        To build a strong team, follow the T.E.A.M. guidelines below:
        Trust yourself and others. Trust builds a sense of acceptance of others. Trust creates confidence in self and others. Trust establishes a “safe harbor” and feelings of security.
        Empower yourself to be your best. Empowering gives permission to excel. Empowering challenges your ability to be creative and innovative. Empowering authorizes you to explore your talent and uniqueness.	Attitude can be your best friend (you decide). Attitude creates positive and negative reactions. A “Can do” attitude motivates others. Attitude reflects your true character.
        Model teamwork to others. Modeling good teamwork is an example for others. Modeling exhibits a sense of cooperation. Modeling encourages others to be “team minded”
        ppropriate, to assist in improving communication with colleagues.
        Dealing with Difficult Behaviour
        INTRODUCTION
        CAUSES
        APPROACH
        Caregivers need to be aware of the types of behaviors they are likely to encounter when working with clients with Dementia. 
        This unit defines “problem” behaviors commonly seen and provides methods for assessing, preventing and dealing with difficult situations.
        COMMON BEHAVIORS:
        - Resisting/fighting hands-on caregivers
        - Wandering and rummaging
        - Physical restlessness
        - Eating problems
        - Sleep disturbances
        - Disruptive yelling or moaning
        - Problematic sexual behavior/ disrobing
        Effective Approaches to Care
        INTERVENTION
        COMFORT
        ANTICIPATE NEEDS
        Do not intervene when a person with Dementia is exhibiting “problem” behavior, unless one of the following applies:


        - The behavior violates the rights of others.
        - The behavior poses a threat to someone’s health and safety.
        When it is necessary to intervene, make sure you do so in a manner that does not endanger the client or other people.
        Turning Negatives into Positives
        SOLUTIONS A.
        It can be useful to engage the client in personally meaningful activities that draws their attention away from upsetting and distressing situations. Examples include:
        - Offer something to eat or drink.
        - Go for a walk; go outdoors.
        - Talk in a calm, soothing way.
        - Play music; sing a song.
        - Look at pictures.
        - Say a prayer; sing a hymn.
        - Pleasant exercise.
        - Reminiscing.
        Therapeutic Activities
        INTRODUCTION
        ACTIVITIES
        BENEFITS
        GUIDELINES
        In this unit, you will learn that activities are the foundation of care. Every event, encounter or exchange is an activity. The scope of activities includes everyday interactions with staff, volunteers, relatives and other individuals.

        In this topic, you will learn how to determine which type of activity is best to suit your client at different times. You will examine activities that are suited to all forms of Alzheimer’s in particular. However these can be used for clients with other forms of dementia.

        The activities that make up a client's daily experience should reflect as much as possible that person's preferred individual lifestyle, whilst enabling a sense of usefulness and success at their level of functioning.

        Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disease. The person with dementia has difficulty doing, or is unable to do, the things that he/she previously enjoyed doing. Cultivating activities with meaningful interactions for the person with memory loss is part of providing successful experiences.
        Lesson Summary

            When communicating with a person with Dementia, one should: introduce oneself by name and association; validate responses and feelings verbally; use short simple sentences; ask primarily yes/no questions; allow time for responses; use word cues; try to guess what the person wants.
            In the early and part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person. This allow you to redirect the person and to achieve a more positive interaction with them.
            When communicating with a client, the goal is to avoid situations likely to create anxiety and conflict, as both will cause the client stress.
            Caregivers must be proactive by anticipating the client's needs ahead of time, especially since clients may not be able to verbalize their needs.
            The activities that make up a client's daily experience, should reflect as much as possible that person's individual preferences. They should enable a sense of usefulness and success at as normal a level of functioning as is possible.
            Activities should help to maintain the independence and physical well being of patients and enhance their quality of life, by providing them with mental stimulation and opportunities to engage in socialization.
            The guidelines for choosing activities include selecting activities that are interesting and stimulating and that consider the person's individuality and environment.
            One person only cannot administer care to a person with dementia; it takes a team.

            INTRODUCTION
            MYSPACE
            SUCCESS
            In 2006, Californian vocalist Colbie Caillat was an aspiring singer-songwriter. Although her audio engineer father, Ken Caillat, coproduced one of the biggest selling albums of all time, Fleetwood 
            Mac’s Rumours, Colbie had never considered booking a studio, much less campaigning for a record deal. 
            Social Media Presence
            SOCIAL NETWORKS
            CONTROL
            TWITTER
            Social networking sites, such as MySpace and virtual worlds, such as Second Life, make it easier for fans to search for new music and easier for artists to
            communicate with their fans. 
            In fact, MySpace has been so influential that it has teamed up with several major labels, to create the MySpace music website. Generating a buzz on social networking sites is sometimes enough to achieve fame and stardom. 


            She considered her music to be a hobby rather than a career choice. [1] Fast-forward a year later and Caillat’s debut album, Coco, was at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, on its way to achieving platinum status. How did an unknown artist from Malibu, California, become a best-selling star in so little time? Caillat’s success can be attributed, in part, to the social networking website 'MySpace'.

        Early Music Technology
        PHONOGRAPHS
        The first stirrings of popular or pop music—any genre of music that appeals to a wide audience or subculture—began in the late 19th century, with discoveries by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner.
        In 1877, Edison discovered that sound could be reproduced using a strip of tinfoil wrapped around a rotating metal cylinder. Edison’s phonograph provided ideas and inspiration for Berliner’s gramophone, which used flat discs to record sound.
        Copyright and New Music Genres
        COPYRIGHT
        POPULAR GENRES
        In the late 19th century, the lax copyright laws that existed in the United States at the beginning of the century were strengthened, providing an opportunity for composers, singers, and publishers to work together to earn money, by producing as much music as possible. 
        Numerous publishers began to emerge in an area of New York that became known as Tin Pan Alley. Allegedly named because the cacophony of many pianos being played in the publishers’ demo rooms sounded like people pounding on tin pans. 
        Tin Pan Alley soon became a prolific source of popular music, with its publishers mass-producing sheet music to satisfy the demands of a growing middle class.

        Radio and Jazz Music
        RADIO
        Radio was an affordable medium that enabled listeners to experience events as they took place. Better yet, it offered a wide range of free music that required none of the musical skills, expensive instruments, or sheet music necessary for creating one’s own music in the home, nor the expense of purchasing records to play on the gramophone.

        This development was a threat to the entire recording industry, which began to campaign for, and was ultimately granted, the right to collect license fees from broadcasters. With the license fees in place, the recording industry eventually began to profit from the new technology.
        The Tin Pan Alley tradition of song publishing, continued throughout the first half of the 20th century, with the show tunes and soothing ballads of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. This included songwriting teams of the early 1950s, such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. 
        By hiring songwriters to compose music based on public demand and mainstream tastes, the Tin Pan Alley publishers introduced the concept of 'popular music' as we know it.
        Jazz and Blues
        BIG JAZZ BAND
        INTEGRATION
        BLUES
        Jazz became a "legitimate form of entertainment" during the 1930s, when white orchestras began to incorporate jazz style into their music. 
        During this time, jazz music began to 
        take on a big band style, combining elements of ragtime, black spirituals, blues, and European music. 

        Key figures in developing the 'big jazz band' included bandleaders Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, and Glenn Miller. These big band orchestras used an arranger, to limit improvisation, by assigning parts of a piece of music to various band members. 
        Electric Guitar and Radio
        ELECTRIC GUITAR
        RADIO STATIONS
        Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, were the first to electrify the blues, through the use of electric guitars and to blend an urban style with classic Southern blues. 

        The electric guitar, first produced by Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931, changed music by intensifying the sound and creating a louder volume that could cut through noise in bars and nightclubs. [4] 
        By focusing less on shouting, singers could focus on conveying more emotion and intimacy in their performances. This electrified form of blues provided the foundation for rock and roll.
        Recording and Playback
        TAPE RECORDING
        MULTI-TRACK
        RECORDS
        Technological advances during the 1940s, made it even easier for people to listen to their favorite music and for artists to record it.
        The introduction of the reel-to-reel tape recorder, paved the way for several innovations that would transform the music industry. 
        The first commercially available tape recorders were monophonic, meaning that they recorded sound onto magnetic tape, using only one track. This may seem limiting today, but at the time it allowed for exciting innovations. 
        Music and Radio
        MUSIC STARS
        TV & RADIO
        PAYOLA
        During the 1940s, a mutually beneficial alliance between sound recording and radio existed. Artists such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald profited from radio exposure. Until this time, music had primarily been recorded for adults, but the popularity of Sinatra and his contemporaries revealed an entirely untapped market: teenagers. 

        The postwar boom of the 1930s and early 1940s, provided many teenagers with the spending money for records. Radio airplay helped to promote and sell records and the recording artists themselves, which in turn stabilized the recording industry. The near-riots caused by the appearance of New Jersey crooner Frank Sinatra in concert, paved the way for mass hysteria among Elvis Presley and Beatles fans during the rock and roll era.
        Rhythm and Blues
        R & B
        Technology wasn’t the only revolution that took place during the 1950s. The urban Chicago blues, typified by artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, and B. B. King, surged in popularity among white and black teenagers alike.  
        Marketed under the name rhythm and blues, or R&B, the sexually suggestive lyrics in songs such as “Sexy Ways” and “Sixty Minute Man”; the electrified guitar and wailing harmonica sounds, appealed to young listeners.

        BRITISH BANDS
        ROCK
        Prior to 1964, rock and roll was primarily an American export. Although U.S. artists frequently reached the top of the charts overseas, few European artists achieved success on the U.S. side of the Atlantic. 
        This situation changed almost overnight, with the arrival of British pop phenomenon the Beatles. Their music combined elements of skiffle—a type of music played on rudimentary instruments, such as banjos, guitars, or homemade instruments—doo-wop and soul. The four "mop-haired" musicians from Liverpool, England, created a genre of music known as Merseybeat, named after the River Mersey
        Although banned from some stations, others embraced the popular new music. In 1951, DJ Alan Freed started a late-night R&B show called 'The Moondog Rock & Roll House Party' and began referring to the music he played as rock and roll. [5] 
        Taking its name from a blues slang term for sex, the music obtained instant notoriety, gaining widespread support among teenage music fans and widespread dislike among the older generation. [6] 
        Frenetic showmen Little Richard and Chuck Berry were early pioneers of rock and roll, and their wild stage performances became characteristic of the genre. 
        Emerging Genres
        SOUL MUSIC
        In Detroit, some black performers were developing a sound that would have crossover appeal with both black and white audiences. Combining R&B, pop, gospel, and blues into a genre known as soul, vocalists such as James Brown and Aretha Franklin sang about the lives of black Americans. 

        Producer and songwriter Berry Gordy Jr., developed soul music through the creation of his Motown label, which would become one of the most successful businesses owned by a black person in American history. [10]
         
        Capitalizing on the 1960s girl-group craze, Gordy produced hits by the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas and, most successfully, Diana Ross and the Supremes. For his bands, he created a slick, polished image, designed to appeal to the American mainstream.

        HIP-HOP
        Gangsterism and Violence
        GANGSTA RAP
        RIVALRY
        In the early 1980s, a second wave of rap artists brought inner-city rap to American youths, by mixing it with hard guitar rock. Pioneered by groups such as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, the new music appealed to black and white audiences alike.
        Another subgenre that emerged was gangsta rap, a controversial brand of hip-hop, epitomized by West Coast rappers such as Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur. Highlighting violence and gang warfare, gangsta rappers faced accusations that they created violence in inner cities—an argument that gained momentum with the East Coast–West Coast rivalry of the 1990s.
        Whereas many British youths expressed their displeasure through punk music, many disenfranchised black American youths in the 1980s, turned to hip-hop—a term for the urban culture that includes break dancing, graffiti art, gangs and the musical techniques of rapping, sampling, and scratching records.

        BALANCE
        Digital Audio Technology
        COMPACT DISCS
        MP3s
        In the mid-1990s, CD sales were booming. Cassette tapes were all but obsolete, and record companies were reaping the benefits of sales to consumers, who wanted their music collections in the latest technological format. 
        This boom was a familiar step in the evolution of technology. In past decades, records seemed to have an ironclad lock on sales, but they were eventually surpassed by cassette sales. Cassettes were then surpassed by CD sales. 
        However, despite a few advantages in quality and convenience, there were several areas in which CDs were lacking. They were expensive for consumers to purchase, and consumers had to buy a full album, even if they were only interested in listening to one or two songs, because every album came as a complete package.
        In Weezer’s 2008 song “Pork and Beans,” vocalist Rivers Cuomo sings, “Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts...Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art.” [1] 
        The lyrics, a reference to hip-hop producer Timbaland’s multiple high-profile collaborations, are an angry reaction to a meeting between Cuomo and record executives at the band’s Geffen label. 
        During the meeting, the executives told the band members they needed to write more commercial material, prompting a defiant (though commercially successful) response. [2] 
        The tight-knit relationship between music and culture is almost impossible to overstate. For example, policies on immigration, war, and the legal system, can influence artists and the type of music 
        they create and distribute. 

        Music may then influence cultural perceptions about race, morality, and
        gender that can, in turn, influence the way people feel about those policies.

        Reacting against the extravagance of disco, many poor urban "rappers" developed a new street culture, by adopting a casual image consisting of T-shirts and sportswear. 
        They developed a language that reflected the everyday concerns of people living in low-income urban areas and embraced the visual art form of graffiti. They described their new culture as hip-hop, after a common phrase chanted at dance parties in New York’s Bronx borough.
        MUSIC
        After the Vietnam War ended, college students began to settle down and focus on careers and families. For some, selfish views took the place of concern with social issues and political activism, causing writer Tom Wolfe to label the 1970s the “me” decade. [13] 
        Musically, this ideological shift resulted in the creation of glam rock, an extravagant, self-indulgent form of rock that incorporated flamboyant costumes, heavy makeup, and elements of hard rock and pop. 
        A primarily British phenomenon, glam rock was popularized by acts such as Slade, David Bowie, the Sweet, Elton John, and Gary Glitter. 
        Having earned himself a reputation as a political spokesperson, Dylan was
        lambasted by traditional folk fans, for playing an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.
        However, his attempt to reach a broader crowd, inspired the folk rock genre, pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds [11]. Even though many fans questioned his decision to go electric, Dylan’s poetic and politically charged lyrics were still influential, inspiring groups like the Beatles and the Animals. 
        File Sharing and Napster
        FILE SHARING
        NAPSTER
        LAWSUITS
        FIGHTBACK
        Initially done only by a tech-savvy elite, the process of downloading and sharing audio files was a painstaking process, because MP3 files were not in one centralized location. 
        Peer-to-peer file sharing—the process in which two or more computer
        systems are connected over the Internet, for the purpose of sharing music or video files—became a worldwide phenomenon in 1999, with the development of the centralized online file-sharing system 'Napster'.

        iTUNES STORE
        Not content with pursuing providers of illegal music downloads, the RIAA also took legal action against the users of sites such as LimeWire and Kazaa. In 2003, the recording industry sued 261 American music fans, for illegally sharing songs on P2P networks. [7] 

        Although fines under U.S. copyright law can rise up to $150,000 per illegally downloaded track, most of the cases were settled for much less. In 2008, the RIAA had sued or threatened to sue more than 30,000 individuals for copyright infringement. [8]
        The Gnutella network, which serves clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX, avoided maintaining a central database. 
        Instead, it dispersed information about file locations, across computer “nodes” around the world. Users were able to find each other, but the service could disclaim the ability to prevent copyright infringements. 
        The lack of a centralized server and multiple client base meant that, unlike Napster, it would be impossible to shut down the entire Gnutella network through a simple court order. Courts would need to block all Gnutella network traffic at the Internet service provider (ISP) level of the Internet, a far trickier prospect than simply shutting down a central database.
        Most recording artists sided with the record labels, with heavy metal rock group Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre launching their own separate lawsuits against Napster in April 2000. However, some bands discovered a way to use the site to their advantage.
        Alternative rock group Radiohead promoted its album 'Kid A', by secretly releasing the record to Napster, 3 weeks before its street release date, creating a wave of publicity that launched the album to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart in October 2000. [4] 
        Reggae-rock band Dispatch poured free recordings onto the site, increasing its fan base to such an extent that it sold out multiple nights at Madison Square Garden in early 2007. [5]

        INNOVATION
        Digital Audio Sales
        AMAZON
        Several companies have attempted to cash in on the success of iTunes, with varying results. In 2007, Internet giant Amazon.com launched the Amazon MP3 digital music download store, that initially offered more than 2 million songs, priced between $0.89 and $0.99. [11] 
        Amazon’s major selling point was its lack of digital rights management (DRM) software, which enabled music downloads to be played on any hardware device. 
        In contrast, songs downloaded through iTunes, could only be played on Apple products. Apple removed these restrictions in 2009, after negotiating an agreement with the major record labels. 
        MARKET SHARE
        Portable Audio Players
        ADVANTAGES
        iPOD
        Once digital music technology was introduced to the world, its domination of the music industry was almost instantaneous. 
        MP3 players have several key advantages over CD players. They are smaller and more portable, eliminating the necessity of lugging around bulky CD carrying cases. 
        Whereas CDs can only hold a relatively small amount of data, MP3 players are able to compress thousands of songs onto a single device (however, this lack of packaging and manufacturing has caused disputes between artists and labels over royalties). 

        The lack of moving parts, means MP3 players can be taken jogging or cycling, without the risk of a song skipping every time the user hits a bumpy patch of road. Users are also no longer obligated to buy entire albums; instead, they can pick and choose their favorite songs from a catalog of online music.
        Module One Summary

            Popular music as we know it, originated out of the Tin Pan Alley tradition that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century in which composers, singers, and publishers worked together to create hit songs. 
            Whereas classical music was exalted for its individuality and stylistic differences, popular music is praised for conforming to the tastes of the audience.
            Technological developments played a crucial role in bringing popular music into people’s homes. 
            The invention of the phonograph and gramophone in the late 19th century, enabled the reproduction and mass distribution of sound recordings. 
            The invention of the reel-to-reel tape recorder and the development of vinyl records in the 1940s, significantly improved the music recording process. 
            The postwar prevalence of radio, hugely impacted popular music, with radio airplay of popular songs promoting record sales.
            Jazz and blues originally emerged from New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s. As many people migrated to Northern urban areas for economic reasons, this had an impact on the kind of music that was created.

                In 1983, radio station WOXY’s new owners bought the station and changed its format from a Top 40, to an up-and-coming alternative rock format, kicking off with U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday.” [1] 
                Then located in the basement of a fast-food restaurant in Ohio, the station was a risk for its purchasers, a husband and wife team, who took a chance by changing the format to a relatively new one. 
                Their investment paid off with the success of their station. By 1990, WOXY had grown in prestige to become one of Rolling Stone magazine’s top 15 radio stations in the country and had even been made famous by a reference in the 1988 film Rain Man. [2] 

                In 1998, the station launched a web cast and developed a national following, ranking 12th among Internet broadcasters for listenership in 2004. [3]

            HISTORY
            Wireless technology made radio as it is known today possible, but its modern, practical function as a mass communication medium had been the domain of other technologies for some time.  

            As early as the 1880s, people relied on telephones to transmit news, music, church sermons, and weather reports. In Budapest, Hungary, for example, a subscription service allowed individuals to listen to news reports and fictional stories on their telephones. [11] 

            Around this time, telephones also transmitted opera performances from
            Paris to London. In 1909, this innovation emerged in the United States, as a 'pay-per-play' phonograph service in Wilmington, Delaware. [12] This service allowed subscribers to listen to specific music recordings on their telephones. [13]
            When Marconi popularized wireless technology, contemporaries initially viewed it as a way to allow the telegraph to function in places that could not be connected by cables. 
            Early radios acted as devices for naval ships to communicate with other ships and with land stations; the focus was on person-to-person
            communication. 
            However, the potential for broadcasting—sending messages to a large group of potential listeners—wasn’t realized until later in the development of the medium.
            AMATEUR RADIO
            At its most basic level, radio is communication through the use of radio waves. This includes radio used for person-to-person communication, as well as radio used for mass communication. 
            Both of these functions are still practiced today. Although most people associate the term radio, with radio stations that broadcast to the general public, radio wave technology is used in everything from television to cell phones, making it a primary conduit for person-to-person communication.

        DEVELOPMENT
        After the World War I radio ban was lifted, with the close of the conflict in 1919, a number of small stations began operating using technologies that had developed during the war. 
        Many of these stations developed regular programming schdules, that included religious sermons, sports, and news. [16] As early as 1922, Schenectady, New York’s WGY, broadcast over 40 original dramas, showing radio’s potential as a medium for drama.
        The WGY players created their own scripts and performed them live on air. This same groundbreaking group also made the first known attempt at television drama in 1928. [17]

        In the mid-1920s, profit-seeking companies such as department stores and newspapers, owned a majority of the nation’s broadcast radio stations, which promoted their owners’ businesses. [23] 
        Nonprofit groups, such as churches and schools, operated another third of the stations. As the number of radio stations outgrew the available frequencies, interference became problematic, and the government stepped into the fray.
        The Radio Act of 1927 established the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), to oversee regulation of the airwaves. A year after its creation, the FRC reallocated station bandwidths to correct interference problems. 
        Not long after radio’s broadcast debut, large businesses saw its potential profitability and formed networks. In 1926, RCA started the National Broadcasting Network (NBC). 
        Groups of stations that carried syndicated network programs, along with a variety of local shows, soon formed its Red and Blue networks. 
        Two years after the creation of NBC, the United Independent Broadcasters became the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and began competing with the existing Red and Blue networks

        The so-called Golden Age of Radio occurred between 1930 and the mid-1950s. Because many associate the 1930s with the struggles of the Great Depression, it may seem contradictory that such a 
        fruitful cultural occurrence arose during this decade. 

        However, radio lent itself to the era. After the initial purchase of a receiver, radio was free and so provided an inexpensive source of entertainment that replaced other, more costly pastimes, such as going to the movies.
        Radio also presented an easily accessible form of media that existed on its own schedule. Unlike reading newspapers or books, tuning in to a favorite program at a certain time became a part of listeners’ daily routine, because it effectively forced them to plan their lives around the

        By the late 1930s, the popularity of radio news broadcasts had surpassed that of newspapers. Radio’s ability to emotionally draw its audiences in close to events, made for news that evoked stronger responses and, thus, greater interest than print news could. 
        For example, the infant son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Radio networks set up mobile stations that covered events as they unfolded, broadcasting nonstop for several days and keeping listeners updated on every detail, while tying them emotionally to the outcome.

        Despite the networks’ hold on programming, educational stations persisted at universities and in some municipalities. They broadcast programs such as the School of the Air and College of the Air, as well as roundtable and town hall forums. 
        In 1940, the FCC reserved a set of frequencies in the lower range of the FM radio spectrum, for public education purposes, as part of its regulation of the new spectrum. 
        The reservation of FM frequencies gave educational stations a boost, but FM proved intitally unpopular, due to a setback in 1945, when the FCC moved the FM bandwidth to a higher set of frequencies, ostensibly to avoid problems with interference. [12] 
        The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and ushered in a new era of government regulation. The organization quickly began enacting influential radio decisions.
        Among these was the 1938 decision to limit stations to 50,000 watts of broadcasting power, a ceiling that remains in effect today. [9] 
        As a result of FCC antimonopoly rulings, RCA was forced to sell its NBC Blue network; this spun-off division became the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1943. [10]

        Early radio network programming laid the groundwork for television’s format, with many different programs that appealed to a variety of people, broadcast at different times of the day. 
        As television’s popularity grew, however, radio could not compete and so it turned to fresh programming techniques. A new type of format-driven station became the norm. Propelled by the development of new types of music, such as psychedelic rock and smooth jazz, the evolution of radio station formats took place. 
        Since the beginning of this shift, different stations have tended to focus on the music that certain demographics prefer to hear.

        Another important innovation in radio in the U.S. was the growth of border stations. Located just across the Mexican border, these stations did not have to follow FCC or U.S. regulatory laws. 
        Because the stations broadcast at 250,000 watts and higher, their listening range covered much of North America. Their content also diverged markedly from that of U.S. stations.

        POP
        Pop contemporary hit radio, or pop CHR, is a subformat of contemporary hit radio (CHR). Other sub-formats of CHR include dance CHR and rhythmic CHR. Branded in the 1980s, this format encompassed stations that had a Top 40 orientation, but drew on a wide number of formats, such as country, rock, and urban. [4] 
        In 2010, pop CHR ranked first among teenage listeners, with 65 percent of its overall listeners aged under 35. This music, ranging from popular artists like Taylor Swift and Kanye West to Shakira, was played in the car more than at home or work and saw its largest listening times in the evenings. Rhythmic CHR, a subformat focusing on a mix of rhythmic pop, R&B, dance, and hip-hop hits, also ranked high in 2010. [5]
        Country music as a format includes stations devoted both to older and newer country music. In 2010, the country music format stood as the most popular radio format, beating out even such prominent non-music formats as news and talk. 
        The format commanded the greatest listener share and the second largest number of stations dedicated to the style. Favored in rural regions of the country, the country music format—featuring artists like Keith Urban, the Dixie Chicks, and Tim McGraw—appeals to both male and female listeners, from a variety of income levels.

        Radio programs reflected the nationwide cultural aspect of radio. Vox Pop, a show originally based on person-in-the-street interviews, was an early attempt to quantify the United States’ growing mass culture.
        Beginning in 1935, the program billed itself as an unrehearsed “cross-section of what the average person really knows”, by asking random people an assortment of questions. 
        Many modern television shows still employ this format, not only for viewers’ amusement and information, but also as an attempt to sum up national culture. [1] 'Vox Pop' functioned on a cultural level, as an acknowledgement of radio’s entrance into people’s private lives, to make them public. [2]

        Although technological advances in the past 50 years, such as audio recorders and microphones, have made creating radio programs easier, finding a way to broadcast programs, presents a difficulty for the average person. 
        The technology of the Internet, however, has transformed this limitation, into a manageable hurdle for both businesses and individuals.
        STREAMING



        CUSTOMIZED
        Developed around 2001 to help terrestrial radio stations compete with emerging satellite radio technology, HD radio is essentially a digital transmission of radio signals, resulting in less static and better sound quality, even for AM stations. 
        Upgraded quality is not the major benefit of HD radio, however; the technology allows signals to be compressed, so that one station can air so-called "shadow stations" on the same frequency as its regular broadcast. 
        Although listeners need a HD radio to receive these channels, they pay no subscription fee, as independent stations provide their own programming, as they deem necessary. [3]
        Although the future of radio has been doubted many times throughout its history, it is still in existence. The inherent portability of the medium, gives it an advantage over other types of media, 
        that require an individual’s full attention, such as television or print. 

        The simplicity of radio has leant itself to a variety of uses. In recent years, new technologies have promised to expand the reach of radio and to expand the kinds of programming it offers. Satellite and HD radio have increased the amount and diversity of available programming, by making more stations available. 
        Internet radio has increased the accessibility of radio communication, and practically anyone who has access to a computer, can create subscription podcasts to distribute around the world. These new technologies promise to
        make radio an enduring, innovative form of media.

        SUCCESS
        Unlike Internet radio, podcasting employs downloadable rather than streamed content. The term podcasting, stems from the use of MP3 players, such as Apple’s iPod. 
        Many terrestrial stations have employed podcasting to supplement their traditional over-the-air broadcasting. Because these are single programs, rather than continuous streaming, podcasts are an easier medium to produce than Internet radio.
        Just as radio evolved from a medium for soap operas and live music to talk shows and recorded music, podcasts are a window into what radio may evolve into in the future.
        Despite the rise of Internet radio over the past several years, its success has never been a sure thing. As the trend gained momentum, many inexperienced broadcasters confronted the issue of 
        royalties, and many experienced broadcasters encountered new legal issues related to streaming. 

        Stations that broadcast over the airwaves must pay publishing royalties to the musicians and songwriters behind the recordings. Rather than pay an individual musician or songwriter each time a recording is played, however,
        broadcasters—including radio stations, coffee shops, and restaurants—pay for a blanket license, that allows them to play any song. 
        Lesson Summary

            The Golden Age of Radio covered the period between 1930 and 1950. It was characterized by radio’s overwhelming popularity and a wide range of programming, including variety, music, drama and theater programs.
            Top 40 radio, arose after most non-music programming moved to television. This format used short playlists of popular hits and gained a great deal of commercial success during the 1950s and 1960s.
            FM radio became popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, as commercial stations tried to appeal to new audiences, who desired higher fidelity and a less restrictive format.
            Empowered by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, media conglomerates have subsumed an unprecedented number of radio stations, merging them into single corporations. 
            Radio station consolidation tends to bring more predictability and profits, at the expense of independent programs.
            Radio station formats (interviews, news, music etc.) tend to use particular advertising products to target their particular audience demographic.
            Contemporary hit radio was developed as a Top 40 format and expanded beyond pop music to include country, rock and other genres.
            Spanish-language formats have grown in recent years, with the 'Mexican Regional' format moving into the to
            Nostalgia genres have developed to reflect the tastes of aging listeners, including music mixes from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
            Radio is unique as a form of mass media, as it has the potential to reach anyone, even the illiterate. 
            Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events directly to the listening public and was used to create a sense of national unity.
            Radio encouraged the growth of popular music stars and brought regional sounds to wider audiences. 
            The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated that radio stations must give equal time to contrasting points of view.
            An enormous rise in the popularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, when commentators were free to broadcast a biased perspective.
            The need for radio stations to generate revenue, places practical limits on what radio personalities can say on the air. 
            Shock jocks such as Howard Stern and Don Imus, test and sometimes exceed "acceptable limits". They have become controversial personalities, highlighting the tension that exists between freedom of speech on the one hand and the need for business to be profitable on the other.
            Radio’s flexibility as a medium, has allowed it to survive the fluctuations of audience tastes and markets.
            Satellite radio, as a monthly subscription service, provides access to unlimited, commercial free and uncensored broadcasting.

                Following in that vein, dozens of other movie studios released 3-D films, resulting in lesser box office successes, such as Alice in Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, and Shrek Forever After. Many film reviewers and audiences seemed adamant—3-D movies were the wave of the future. 

                Throughout the history of film, Technicolor dyes, enhanced sound systems, and computer-generated graphics have boasted huge box-office revenues; however, it’s ultimately the viewers who determine what a good movie is and who set the standard for future films.

            MARKETING
            PROMOTION
            In the movie industry today, publicity and product are two sides of the same coin. Even films that get a lousy critical reception can do extremely well in ticket sales, if their marketing campaigns manage to create enough hype. Similarly, two comparable films can produce very different results at the box office, if they have been given different levels of publicity. 
            This explains why the film 'What Women Want', starring Mel Gibson, brought in $33.6 million in its opening weekend in 2000. However, a few months later, 'The Million Dollar Hotel', starring Gibson, only brought in $29,483 during its opening weekend. [1] Unlike in the days of the Hollywood studio system, actors alone no longer draw audiences in to see movies. 
            The first technology for home video recording, Sony’s Betamax cassettes, hit the market in 1975. The device, a combined television set and videocassette recorder (VCR), came with the high price tag of $2,495, making it a luxury still too expensive for the average American home. 
            Two years later, RCA released the vertical helical scan (VHS) system of recording, which would eventually outsell Betamax, though neither device was yet a popular consumer product. 
            Within several years however, the concept of home movie recording and viewing was beginning to catch on. In 1979, Columbia Pictures released 20 films for home viewing and a year later Disney entered the market with the first authorized video rental plan for retail stores. 
            While the development of narrative film was largely driven by commercial factors, it is also important to acknowledge the role of individual artists who turned it into a medium of personal expression. 
            The motion picture of the silent era was generally simplistic in nature; acted in overly-animated movements, to engage the eye; accompanied by live music, played by musicians in the theater and including written titles, to create a mood and to narrate a story. 
            Within the confines of this medium, one filmmaker in particular emerged to
            transform the silent film into an art and to unlock its potential as a medium of serious expression and persuasion; D.W. Griffith.

            ADVERTISING
            The Hollywood “dream factory,” as Hortense Powdermaker labeled it in her 1950 book on the movie industry, [3] manufactures an experience that is part art and part commercial product. [4]  The films the studios churn out, are the result of a capitalist enterprise that ultimately looks to the “bottom line” to guide most major decisions. 
            Hollywood is an industry and as in any other industry in a mass market, its success relies on the control of resources, access to mass distribution and effective marketing strategies. This helps to maximize the product’s reach and to minimize competition. [5] In this way, Hollywood has an enormous influence on the films to which the public has access to.
            Costs and Models
            COSTS
            While it may seem that the major studios are making heavy profits, movie making today is a much riskier and less profitable enterprise than it was in the studio system era. 
            The massive budgets required for the global marketing of a film, are huge financial gambles. In fact, most movies cost the studios more to market and produce—upwards of $100 million—than the returns generated at the box-office. 
            With such high stakes, studios have come to rely on a handful of blockbuster films that keep them afloat, [8] movies such as Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean and Avatar. [9] 
            Lesson Summary
                Early motion picture technology was first introduced to a mass audience through Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope in 1891.
                It wasn’t until the Lumière brothers released the Cinématographe in 1895, that motion pictures were projected for public audience viewing. 
                Film established itself as a popular form of entertainment in the United States, with Nickelodeon theaters in the 1910s.
                By 1915 most of the major film studios had moved to Hollywood in California, because of cheaper land and better outdoor filming conditions.
                D.W. Griffith’s silent film 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), presented a racial perspective on the U.S. Civil War and its aftermath and caused much controversy.
                The release of 'The Jazz Singer' in 1927 marked the birth of the talking film. By 1930, silent films were a thing of the past. 
                Technicolor emerged in film in the 1930s and found early success with movies such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind.
                The majority of films would continue to be made in black and white, until the late 1950s.
                    During the Golden Age of Hollywood (1920s - 1960s), the major studios controlled all aspects of the movie industry, from production to distribution and the movie theaters themselves. The audience numbers that regularly attended movie theaters during this period, has not been surpassed.
                    During World War II, film production was monitored by the government and tended to promote a patriotic, pro-war sentiment.
                    After World War II, the power of the studio system declined, as a result of antitrust legislation and the invention of television.
                    In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rise in films that celebrated the emerging youth culture and the rejection of conservatism, with films such as Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Easy Rider. This movement also encouraged looser attitudes towards sexuality and violence in film. 
                    After the failure of the Vietnam War (1975), films began to reflect a more ambivalent attitude toward war.
                    The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the blockbuster movie and bigger advertising budgets, with films such as Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather.
                    A film’s performance at the box office is often directly related to the marketing and advertising budget that promotes it.
                    The widespread use of the VCR in households in the 1980s, reduced movie theater attendance, but opened up a new mass market of home movie viewers.
                        Improvements in computer animation and digital effects in the 1990s, led to the success of films such as The Matrix, Jurassic Park and the first fully computer-animated film 'Toy Story'.
                        Movies and culture tend to have a symbiotic relationship, i.e. both reflect and influence each other. 
                        Movies are a powerful medium and audiences can adopt the attitudes and styles of the characters they watch on screen. 
                        Because of the high marketing and production costs, the major film studios have increasingly come to rely on blockbuster films to keep themselves profitable.
                        Independent films became more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, in part because they represented a break from the predictable material released by the big studios.
                        The VCR was replaced by DVDs in the late 1990s and by the Blu-ray Disc in the 2000s, when digital video sales and renta

                        Three-dimensional (3D) movies were introduced as a novelty in the 1950s. Improved 3D film and projection technology in recent years, has led to a resurgence of the market, with premium ticket prices aiding profitability.

                            CONCEPT
                            In November 2007, more than 12,000 film, television and radio writers working in the United States, went on strike for fairer pay. 
                            Lasting for more than 3 months, the strike disrupted many hit shows in 2008 and cost the Los Angeles economy $2.5 billion. [1] 

                            While production for many television shows was on hiatus, several industry executives were thinking of new ways to reach their audience. Declaring that it was “time to change the face of Show Business as we know it,” Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator, Joss Whedon started writing a three-part musical series, specifically designed to be released on the Internet.

                        The first act of Dr. Horrible was released on its official website on July 15, 2008 and it was hosted on the free online video service Hulu. Act II followed on July 17 and Act III appeared two days later. 

                        Viewers could watch all three episodes for free online anywhere in the world. Shortly after the free viewing, the tragicomic musical was made available for purchase on iTunes, where it reached No. 1 on the video chart, totaling 2.2 million downloads per week. The soundtrack was also released via iTunes, obtaining the No. 1 spot on the first day of its release and debuting at No. 39 on the 'Billboard 200' chart. 

                        Capitalizing on the musical’s online success, Whedon authorized the creation of a DVD, which was released exclusively through Amazon.com on December 19, 2008. It reached the No. 3 position on Amazon’s movie and television sales. 
                        Television's Influence
                        IMPACTS
                        Since replacing radio as the most popular mass medium in the 1950s, television has played such an integral role in modern life that, for some, it is difficult to imagine being without it. 
                        Both reflecting and shaping cultural values, television has at times been criticized for its alleged negative influences on children and young people and at other times lauded for its ability to create a common experience for all its viewers. 
                        Early Television Technology
                        SYSTEM
                        CRT
                        SCANNER
                        Inventors conceived of the idea of television long before the technology to create it had appeared. Early pioneers speculated that if audio waves could be separated from the electromagnetic spectrum to create radio, so too television waves could be separated to transmit visual images. 
                        As early as 1876, Boston civil servant George Carey envisioned a complete television system and submitted drawings for a “selenium camera”, that would enable people to “see by electricity” a year later. [3]
                        In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used both the CRT and the mechanical scanner system, in an experimental system. With the CRT in the receiver, he used focused electron beams to display images, transmitting crude geometrical patterns onto a screen. The mechanical disk system was used as a camera, creating a primitive television system.

                        LIMITATIONS
                        From early experiments with visual transmissions, two types of television systems came into existence: mechanical television and electronic television. 
                        Mechanical television developed out of Nipkow’s disk system and was pioneered by British inventor John Logie Baird. In 1926, Baird gave the world’s first public demonstration of a television system, at Selfridge’s department store in London. 
                        At the same time Baird was developing the mechanical model, other inventors were working on an electronic television system based on the CRT. While working on his father’s farm, Idaho teenager Philo Farnsworth realized that an electronic beam could scan a picture in horizontal lines, reproducing the image almost instantaneously. 
                        Electronic Television
                        TRANSMISSION
                        In 1927, Farnsworth transmitted the first all-electronic television picture, by rotating a single straight line scratched onto a square piece of painted glass, by 90 degrees.

                        Farnsworth barely profited from his invention. During World War II, the government suspended sales of television sets and by the time the war ended, Farnsworth’s original patents were close to expiring.
                        However, following the war, many of his key patents were modified by RCA and were widely applied in broadcasting, to improv

                        CONCEPT
                        PULLED
                        When television was in its infancy, producers modeled the new medium on radio. Popular radio shows such as police drama 'Dragnet' and western cowboy series 'Gunsmoke', were adapted for television. 
                        New television shows were sponsored by single advertisers, just as radio shows had been. Television was dominated by three major networks—NBC, ABC and CBS. These networks accounted for more than 95 percent of all prime-time viewing, until the late 1970s. 

                        Today, the television industry is far more complex. Programs are sponsored by multiple advertisers and programming is controlled by major media conglomerates. The three major networks no longer dominate the airwaves, but instead share their viewers with numerous cable channels. Several factors account for these trends within the industry, including technological developments, government regulations and the creation of new network
                        Since its inception as an integral part of American life in the 1950s, television has both reflected and nurtured cultural mores and values. 
                        The escapist dramas of the 1960s, consciously avoided controversial issues and glossed over life’s harsher realities, in favor of an idealized portrayal of life.

                        DATA
                        The experience of watching television is rapidly changing with the progression of technology. No longer restricted to a limited number of channels on network television, or even to a television schedule, viewers are now able to watch exactly what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.
                        Non-television delivery systems such as the Internet, enables viewers to download traditional television shows onto a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone and this is changing the way people watch television. 
                        Meanwhile, cable and satellite providers are enabling viewers to purchase television shows to watch at their convenience, through the use of video-on-demand services. This has changed the concept of prime-time viewing.
                        Lesson Summary
                            Two key technological developments in the late 1800s played a vital role in the evolution of television: the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk. 
                            The cathode ray tube, invented by German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897, was the forerunner of the television picture tube. It had a florescent screen that emitted a visible light (in the form of images) when struck by a beam of electrons. 
                            The scanning disk, invented by German inventor Paul Nipkow, was a large, flat metal disk that could be used as a rotating camera. It served as the foundation for experiments on the transmission of visual images for several decades.
                            Out of the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk, two types of primitive television systems evolved: mechanical systems and electronic systems. 
                            Mechanical television systems had several technical disadvantages: low resolution caused fuzzy images and the use of a spinning disk limited the number of new pictures that could be seen per second, resulting in excessive flickering. 
                            By 1939, all mechanical television broadcasts in the United States had been replaced by electronic broadcasts.
                            Early televisions were expensive and the technology was slow to catch on, as development was delayed during World War II. 
                                Following the Second World War, television rapidly replaced radio as the new main form of mass communication.
                                During the “golden age” of television in the 1950s, television moved away from radio formats and began developing new types of shows, including the magazine-style variety show and the television spectacular.
                                Color television gained popularity in the late 1960s and began to replace black-and-white television in the 1970s. 
                                Cable television, initially developed in the 1940s to cater to viewers in rural areas, switched its focus from local to national broadcasts, offering a variety of channels. 
                                In 2009, the traditional analog system, which had been in place for 60 years, was replaced with digital television, giving viewers a higher-quality picture and freeing up frequency space. 
                                In 2010, nearly half of American viewers used high-definition television, which offers a crystal-clear picture, with wide-screen, to provide a "cinematic experience" at home.
                                Television has reflected changing cultural values, since it first gained popularity, following the Second World War.
                                During the 1950s, most programs ignored current events and political issues, in favor of family-friendly domestic comedies, featuring mainly white suburban middle-class families.

                                    Entrepreneurship is an essential driver of economic development. It is also the process of planning, launching and running a new business with the motive of earning profit and creating wealth
                                    Entrepreneurship is important because it boosts economic growth by introducing innovative technologies, products and services
                                    Increased competition from entrepreneurs challenges and also motivates the established companies to become more competitive and to renew and review their own methods of doing. So the economy benefits because newer products and newer services are brought in by the entrepreneurs
                                    There are four different types of Entrepreneurs and they are: Innovative Entrepreneurs, Replicative Entrepreneurs, Opportunity Entrepreneurs and, Necessity Entrepreneurs

                                        Entrepreneurs have major characteristics that tell them apart from manager and those characteristics are: they have got lots of confidence in our own technical and managerial competencies which makes them to see a market opportunity or a product opportunity where other people do not see same
                                        Entrepreneurship is important to the economy because it creates great economic wealth and creates huge employment
                                        The triggers of the quest for entrepreneurship are: a dislike for the paid job system, a revulsion in working for someone else's satisfaction, a firm conviction in one's technical and managerial competencies, etc
                                        The three aspects to an entrepreneur are: they have a purpose, they are creative and they have passion for their vocation
                                        Entrepreneurs create an expanding role of entrepreneurship because they are inventors and they are builders of a nation's economy
                                        Entrepreneurial discovery is a combination of: intrinsic entrepreneurial personality, acquired entrepreneurial experience, organizational and environmental expectations
                                        Assessment of the intrinsic entrepreneurial personality can be achieved to a reasonable degree with personality tests and assessment
                                        There are quite a number of entrepreneurial personality assessment tests and here are a few: psychometric tools, the more sophisticated tests such as Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), BDC etc

                Below you will find key information covered in this module:

                    Criminology includes studying all aspects of crime and law enforcement—criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, and capture and punishment. 
                    Crime is an act or omission in violation of a law committed without defence or justification. The Revised Penal Code (RPC) of Reyes (2018) states that crime is committed not only by malice (dolo) but also by means of fault (culpa). There is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent. There is fault when the wrongful act result from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill
                    The criminal profile describes the likely social and mental characteristics of the criminal. Victimology is a field with a less generally agreed-upon theoretical framework or research paradigm than many longer-established disciplines. 
                     Various crimes exist, including crimes against persons, victimless crimes, violent crimes, and white-collar crimes. Criminology is the study of crime and criminal behaviour, informed by principles of sociology and other non-legal fields, including psychology, economics, statistics, and anthropology.
                    The roots of criminology trace back to a movement to reform criminal justice and penal systems more than 200 years ago. The first collection and use of crime statistics in the 19th century then Basics of Criminal Investigation

                            The significant changes in force projection did not occur until the nineteenth century, a change in which motivation and technology played a key role.
                            The age of cavalry was the age of poor infantry, and it was a political, not a technological, phenomenon.
                            It is hard to separate military experience from war thinking because the past is a source of examples and ideas.
                            The 7th century saw the birth of Islam, which brought with it a massive conquest effort.

                            During the world wars, trench warfare was transferred by a gradual evolution of artillery and infantry tactics, integrating new technology effectively.
                            The prime functions of aircraft were reconnaissance and artillery spotting-giving army gunners feedback on where their shells had landed.
                            World War I and II saw progress in wired and wireless communications technology.

                            The development of weaponry and other technology products affected warfare and its course profoundly and continuously.
                            The most significant single element in maintaining high morale is leadership.

                            Fear is managed in combat by decisive and capable leadership.
                            Lesson Summary
                            Tools of war have been instrumental in conquests, invasions, and enslavement throughout history, but they have also been used to check evil and maintain peace.
                            Military Weaponry and Aviation:
                                Weapons have evolved to become both more lethal and complex.
                                A great part of technology development of weaponry has taken part in the last two centuries, especially the twentieth century.
                                From the beginning of World War I, aircraft were used to drop bombs or heavy steel darts on enemy forces.
                                The bomber aircraft blurred the lines between combatants and non-combatants.
                            British Military History:
                                Aden became a functional coaling station for the Royal Navy and merchant vessels on passage to the Far East.
                                British policy was to preserve Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and continued Russian expansion in central Asia.
                                Britain's maritime involvement in the Far East had hitherto centred upon the Indian Ocean. Understanding Veterans' Mental Health

                    Lesson Summary
                        The United States has approximately 3.5 million military personnel comprised of various active duty, reserve, and Department of Defense civilian personnel.
                        The Army is the largest service branch with nearly 500,000 members followed by the Navy, Air Force, and Marines.
                        According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States has approximately 20 million veterans.
                        Military personnel face the full range of traumatic events experienced by civilians as well as events unique to military service.
                        Common traumatic events associated with military service include coming across a dead body unexpectedly and witnessing the injury or death of another person.
                        Military sexual trauma is defined as “sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment that occurred while the victim was in the military”.
                        Any deployment, even those to non-combat areas, is a significant event that can disrupt the lives of the service member and their family. 
                        A successful reintegration following a long or especially difficult deployment requires the entire family. 
                        Despite the benefits of seeking early mental health care, many of the mental health resources available to veterans remain vastly underutilized.
                        To ensure a standardized approach to mental health care throughout the entire VA system, the VA has established guidelines as to the types of mental health services that VA hospitals and clinics must offer to veterans and their families.

                    For many of us, the prospect of nuclear warfare raises fears of the end of life as we know it.

                    Into the Deep
                    You may be surprised to learn that hundreds of nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmo
                    e Race for the First Atomic Bomb
                    The first nuclear bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. The project was launched in response to fears that the Nazis might try to construct an atom bomb after a major research breakthrough in 1938.

                    'Father' of the Atomic Bomb
                    German scientists Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann and Lise Meitner had discovered how to bombard uranium with neutrons, causing it to break up and release vast amounts of energy. The process is called splitting the atom, or nuclear fission. The trio received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966 for their discovery.

                    The First Test
                    On July 16, 1945, under President Truman, the Americans successfully detonated the first atomic bomb, in the Trinity Test. Those present watched in awe as an explosion equivalent to about 21,000 tons of the explosive TNT created a mushroom cloud that was over 3,000 feet wide and soared 40,000 feet in the sky.

                    Just one month later, the USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, forcing an end to World War II. 
                    We will look at that in more detail later.
                    The Arms Race
                    In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a burgeoning arms race saw the USA and USSR develop and test new types of bombs, with the USA focusing on methods of delivery and the Soviet Union aiming for maximum size or ‘yield’.
                    In the ensuing years, the UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also began to develop nuclear arsenals.

                    Decommissioned Weapons
                    Opt Outs
                    In 1970, after a period of escalation, the USA, USSR and UK, France and China signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT or Non-Proliferation Treaty), along with 38 other countries.
                    Atmospheric Tests
                    With so many countries developing nuclear weapons, you have probably already been exposed to fallout from  weapons tests in your lifetime, especially if you live in the northern hemisphere. Over 500 missiles have exploded above ground and in the skies above our heads.
                    UN: Radioactive Materials 'Everywhere'
                    In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reported to the General Assembly that: “The main man-made contribution to the exposure of the world's population has come from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, from 1945 to 1980. Each nuclear test resulted in the unrestrained release into the environment of substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface.”

                    543 Atmospheric Tests
                    Dangers Not Recognized
                    Annual Radiation Doses LowThe UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reported that levels of contamination had continued to drop since testing ended. “The average annual doses are 10% higher in the northern hemisphere, where most of the testing took place, and lower in the southern hemisphere. Although there was considerable concern at the time of testing, the annual doses remained relatively low, reaching at most about 7% of the background level from natural radiation sources.”
                    Monitoring ShortfallsWhile atmospheric tests were carried out above ground, an estimated 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990, according to UNSCEAR. Particularly during the early years, from 1945 to 1960, local populations that were

                    The events on the previous page chart the rapid transition of physics research from the blackboard to the test site. Most of the explosions yielded 15 to 23 kilotons, or the equivalent of 23,000 tons of TNT.
                    The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki yielded approximately 15 and 21 kilotons respectively. The death tolls on the previous page are a conservative estimate as tragically, the exact number of deaths has never been established.

                    Biggest Debut
                    The arms race began when the USSR detonated its first nuclear explosive in 1949 at the Semipalatinsk test site in modern-day Kazakhstan. Code-named RDS-1, the device had a yield of 22 kilotons and the fallout was detected by the USA.

                    North Korea
                    1963: As a consequence of Tsar Bomba, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain on August 5. It prohibits testing in the atmosphere, in outer space, under water, or in any area within a state’s territory that would cause ‘radioactive debris’ to fall outside the state's territory. There are now 126 parties to the PNTBT.
                    Since 1980, all nuclear tests have been conducted underground.
                    Current Nuclear Arms Treaties
                    Over the decades a number of treaties have been agreed upon, which attempt to ensure transparency and accountability worldwide. The most significant include:

                        Partial Ban: As mentioned, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banned testing in the atmosphere, outerspace, underwater or anywhere that might contaminate a neighboring country.
                        Comprehensive Ban: The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996 bans all nuclear explosions, for civilian or military purposes, however, it has yet to be enforced.
                        New START: A third arrangement is the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. New START came into force on February 5, 2011, and lasts until February 4, 2026. It imposes limits on both countries so long as the treaty remains in force.
                        JCPOA for Iran: Finally, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an agreement between Iran and China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the USA dated July 14, 2015. It allows for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran’s nuclear capability. On May 30, 2022, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to credibly explain the presence of altered uranium at Turquzabad, Varamin and ‘Marivan’, or the location(s) of the nuclear material that was moved from Turquzabad in 2018. Further, nuclear activities and nuclear material used at Lavisan-Shian were not declared as required under the Compreh
                        What Causes a Nuclear Explosion?
                        About AtomsAll matter is made up of atoms - minute structures that combine a mix of three particles called protons (which have a positive electric charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge). 
                        Each atom has a nucleus at its center, where the neutrons and protons are close together.
                        Splitting the Atom
                        Breaking a nucleus by bombarding it with neutrons causes the amount of energy associated with explosives to be released.
                        Fission and Fusion
                        Nuclear explosions are divided into two types. In both instances, some sort of conventional explosive is needed to trigger the initial reaction.
                        Nuclear Fission
                        Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Not all elements lend themselves to the process. The most commonly used isotope is uranium-235. This is because uranium ore (pictured) occurs naturally in the earth and in seawater and can go through an ‘enriching’ process to become fissionable U-235.
                        Plutonium-239, uranium-233, and thorium-232 may also be used. These isotopes are variations of the element with different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Plutonium is a byproduct of nuclear fission and can be reprocessed for use more easily than uranium can be enriched, however, it is extremely radioactive. Needless to say, both enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium are complex and expensive procedures.

                    What Impact Would a Nuclear Explosion Have?
                    Many factors influence the severity of the damage caused by an explosion - the materials used in the weapon, the size of it, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and what the weather is like at the time. These factors also affect the resulting shockwave, thermal radiation, light and radioactivity, therefore it is difficult to generalize about the impact of any given explosion.

                    The only certainty is that those closest to the explosion are most at risk from the intense heat of the fireball, the powerful shockwave created by the blast, and ionizing radiation, but the chances of survival increase rapidly the further you are from ground zer

                    The circle areas are idealized for planning purposes and illustration, and are unlikely to be this symmetrical. Borders between zones are likely to be less distinct.

                    The Emergency Response
                    In the event of a blast, emergency planners would divide the area around a blast site into Severe, Moderate and Light Damage zones. The following information, courtesy of the USDHHS Radiation Emergency Medical Management, describes what emergency workers might expect as they approach from the Light Damage Zone and proceed towards ground zero:
                    Light Damage (LD) Zone
                    Litter and Rubble
                    Blast Overpressures
                    Damage is caused by shocks, similar to those produced by a thunderclap or a sonic boom, but with much more force. 


                    Although some windows may be broken over 10 miles (16 km) away, the injury associated with flying glass will generally occur at overpressures above 0.5 psi. 


                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about 3 miles (4.8 km) from ground zero for a 10 KT nuclear explosion. The damage in this area will be highly variable as shock waves rebound multiple times off of buildings, the terrain, and even the atmosphere.
                    The Moderate Damage Zone
                    Responders may expect they are transitioning into the MD zone when building damage becomes substantial.
                    Structural Damage
                    Street Clearing
                    Hazards
                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about one mile (1.6 km) from ground zero for a 10KT nuclear explosion. The determination is made by ground-level and/or overhead imagery.


                    Observations in the MD zone include significant structural damage, blown-out building interiors, blown-down utility lines, overturned automobiles, caved roofs, some collapsed buildings, and fires. Some telephone poles and street light poles will also be blown over.

                    Sturdier buildings (e.g., reinforced concrete) will remain standing, lighter commercial and multi-unit residential buildings may be fallen or structurally unstable, and many wood-frame houses will be destroyed
                    The Severe Damage Zone
                    Few Survivors
                    Rubble
                    Hiroshima
                    Few, if any, buildings are expected to be structurally sound or even standing in the Severe Damage (SD) zone, and very few people would survive.


                    However, some people protected within stable structures (e.g., subterranean parking garages or subway tunnels) at the time of the explosion may survive the initial blast.


                    Very high radiation levels from prompt and residual origin and other hazards are expected in the SD zone, significantly increasing risks to survivors and responders. Responders should enter this zone with great caution, only to rescue known survivors.
                    Predictions Based on Best Guesses
                    The previous pages consider the degrees of damage from a 10-kiloton explosion, however, as we have already stated, everything from the position of a device when it is detonated to the weather on the day can have a bearing on the outcome.
                    Yields
                    Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs are a great deal more destructive, or give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs. While many weapons tests have been carried out over the years, governments have been loath to reveal full details due to military sensitivities. The overall yield of explosions has been documented, however, the amount of fusion and fission yields from each test remain unknown, making it difficult for scientists to predict the degree of hazard posed by future explosions.
                    Remote TestsFurthermore, the sites of all the tests carried out over the years have been oceans or deserts, which limit the creation of fires and smoke, and therefore give a less than accurate portrayal of the impact of an explosion in the sort of urban setting that might be targeted in a military attack

                    Nuclear weapons in the modern era tend to be classified as either ‘tactical’ or ‘nonstrategic’ nuclear weapons or as ‘strategic’ or ‘long range’ weapons. Tactical or nonstrategic weapons are regarded as ‘battle’ weapons, with a shorter range and lower yield than ‘strategic’ or long-range weapons, which are more powerful and are designed to attack another country. Tactical weapons do not appear to be included in the New START treaty between the USA and the USSR. See https://www.state.gov/new-start/ for details.

                    'Cannot Be Won'
                    In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.  In June 2022, tensions rose over Russian fears that Ukraine's allies in the EU might supply it with nuclear weapons following the Russian invasion.
                    Nuclear Tests Underground
                    We have seen that the place where an explosion happens - in the atmosphere or on the ground - has an impact on the degree of devastation caused. Devices that explode in the air create less fallout than those on the ground. But what do we know of the impact of an explosion underground or underwater?
                    In the case of an explosion at ground level, radioactive fallout is a much more pressing danger than it is in the case of an atmospheric or air explosion, as the blast causes much dirt and debris to be sucked up from the ground and irradiated.
                    Underground Tests
                    Between the year of 1963 when the Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, until 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed, the world’s major nuclear powers tested hundreds of weapons underground. In fact, the USA alone performed 815 underground tests over the decades, mainly at the Nevada Test Site (pictured).

                    o Nuclear Tests Trigger Earthquakes?
                    The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation is often compared to or measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, that does not necessarily mean that the explosion has caused an earthquake. For instance, the Cannikin test in Alaska released energy equivalent to a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, however, it did not trigger any earthquakes in the seismically active Aleutian Islands.

                    The seismic waves produced by underground nuclear explosions have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes. 

                    The US Geological Survey acknowledges that nuclear explosions may cause earthquakes, however, these are much smaller than the explosion, and the aftershock sequence produces fewer and smaller aftershocks than a similar size earthquake. The range of a possible earthquake triggered by an explosion is limited to a few tens of kilometers.
                    Hiroshima and Nagasaki
                    There have been numerous weapons tests and many serious accidents in which radioactive material was leaked, however, there remain just two occasions when nuclear bombs were deliberately unleashed in an act of war. The fact that both targets were urban areas gives a different perspective on the consequences of a nuclear explosion from tests in unpopulated areas.
                    The former Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall was one of the few buildings to survive the bombing of Hiroshima. It’s now famous as the A-Bomb Dome, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.

                    Lesson Summary
                    The main points you have learned from this module are as follows:

                        Nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmosphere.
                        German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered how to split the atom by bombarding uranium with neutrons in a process called nuclear fission, in 1938.
                        The race to build the first nuclear weapon began when Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt about their concerns that the Nazis might weaponize Hahn and Strassman’s discovery.
                        The first atomic bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. It was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity Test and its 21 kiloton yield created a mushroom cloud over 3,000 feet wide and 40,000 feet high.
                        The USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945, bringing an end to World War II.
                        The Arms Race began in the late 1940s and early 1950s between the USA and USSR. The UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also developed nuclear arsenals. In 1970, all five countries signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
                        Other nuclear powers include Pakistan (1972), India (1974), Israel and North Korea. South Africa, Ukraine and Uzbekistan dismantled their nuclear arsenals.
                        Lesson Summary
                            In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation said that from 1945 to 1980, nuclear tests had released ‘substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface’.
                            The USA and the USSR tested thermonuclear weapons in 1952-3, spreading fallout worldwide. In 1958 the US Food and Drug Administration reported that tea harvests from 1956 and 1957 had 30 times more radioactive isotope strontium-90 than pre-1945 samples.
                            In October 1963, after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USA, the UK and the USSR signed a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; France and China continued atmospheric tests.
                            Atmospheric tests ceased in 1980 after 543 tests caused radionuclides, particularly strontium-90 and cesium-137 to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere.
                            Approximately 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990.
                            The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was opened for signatures in 1996, however, it has not been enforced yet.
                            According to the geomapping company Esri UK , there have been 2,624 nuclear detonations across the world since 1945.
                            The sites of all the tests ca
                            Lesson Summary
                                Modern weapons are classified as either ‘tactical’ or ‘nonstrategic’ nuclear (battle) weapons or as ‘strategic’ or ‘long range’ weapons designed to attack another country.
                                In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.
                                Many factors influence the destructive capacity of a nuclear explosion - the materials used in the weapon, its size, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and the weather.
                                In the case of a 10 kiloton explosion, the Severe Damage Zone is estimated at about a half-mile radius (0.8km); the Moderate Damage Zone would be about one mile, or 1.6km; the Light Damage Zone is likely to extend about 3 miles or 4.8km from ground zero.
                                Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Thermonuclear or Hydrogen bombs use fission for the initial explosion followed by nuclear fusion where further energy is released as two nuclei are fused to become one. Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs.
                                Thermal Radiation consists of an initial rapid burst of ultraviolet radiation, followed by a second, more sustained pulse. It reaches temperatures of up to 100 million degrees centigrade, causing combustible materials to ignite. Smoke or clouds can mitigate this risk.

                            Lesson Summary
                                The strength of the blast is measured by the pound per square inch (psi) of pressure above the normal atmospheric amount. The blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound. In an atmospheric explosion, the first and second blast waves merge to form a Mach Stem.
                                1963’s Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, so nuclear powers tested their weapons underground.
                                The first underground test took place at the Nevada test site in the USA in 1951 while the US conducted its last nuclear test, codenamed Divider, at an underground facility in Nevada on September 23, 1992. It carried out 815 underground tests. In 1996 the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty officially ended all testing. 
                                The largest underground US nuclear explosion was the Cannikin test on Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, on November 6, 1971. The shock registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. Wildlife was badly affected locally but there was no tsunami and almost no radioactivity. Seafood is safe for human consumption.
                                The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation may be measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, the seismic waves have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes.
                                In 1969, research at the Nevada Test Site found the tests did not trigger earthquakes in earthquake-prone California.

                        Introduction
                        Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the landscape of contemporary mental health and criminology. As society grapples with increasing challenges at the intersection of mental health and violent behavior, it is crucial for professionals navigating these terrains to be deeply informed, both theoretically and pragmatically.
                        This course delves into the pertinence of understanding this complex interplay, beginning with an exploration of the key findings from the Bureau of Justice Report - Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement from 2011. Armed with this data-driven context, participants will transition into mastering basic initial screening techniques, subsequently diving deep into the intricate relationships between various mental health disorders and the potential for violent behavior.
                        Anchored by robust guiding studies, an exploration into the nuances of psychopathy, and a meticulous understanding of homicide typology, the course offers a comprehensive look into the subject. Moreover, as firearms remain a significant factor in the equation, emphasis on promoting firearm safety with patients becomes paramount, a theme accentuated by scrutinizing firearm availability statistics. By the culmination of this course, participants will possess a sophisticated, multidimensional grasp of Homicide Risk Evaluation and its intrinsic tie to Firearm Safety
                        The Relevance
                        Among U.S. citizens, homicide is still the second leading cause of death (tied with suicide) between the ages of 1-24 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) and between the third to fifth leading cause of death between the ages of 25-44 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) depending on how you split up the age range (25-44 vs. 25-34). The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations; with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.

                        Gun-Related Homicides in the U.S.
                        Although violent crime rates fell over 50% from 1993 to 2015 (e.g., Gramlich, 2017), the more than two-decade downward trend for violent crime in the U.S. appears to be shifting and rates have been rising in recent years. For example, an estimated 14,827 persons were murdered in the U.S. in 2012 (FBI 1, 2012); a number that while not including “justifiable” homicide, represents a slightly higher homicide rate than the 2011 rate of 4.7 homicides per 100,000 persons that was the lowest homicide rate since 1963 (Smith & Cooper, 2013).
                        The Relevance (Contd)
                        In comparison to other high-income nations, overall, Americans are:

                            Seven times more likely to be violently killed
                            Twenty-five times more likely to be violently killed with a gun
                            Six times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun
                            Eight times more likely to commit suicide using a gun
                            Ten times more likely to die from a firearm death overall (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).

                        Victim Demographics
                        In 2014, the overall rate of death by firearms in the United States was 10.3 per 100,000 people — the same as for death by motor vehicles — with suicides accounting for roughly two out of every three gun-related deaths. 
                        To illustrate the recent upward trend consider that in the first 200 days of 2014, there were 6,206 gun deaths on record, not counting suicides. Data collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit organization that tracks shootings via media reports and law enforcement records, show that within the first 200 days of 2017, that figure jumped by well over one-third to

                        The average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than the rate for whites.	The average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than the rate for whites.
                        From 2002 to 2011, young adults ages 18 to 24 had the highest homicide rate of any age group and experienced the greatest rate decline (down 22%) over the 10 years, from 15.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 11.9 in 2011.	The rate of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 49% from 1992 to 2011, while the percentage of homicide victims killed by a firearm (67%) remained stable.
                        Large cities with 100,000 or more residents experienced the largest decline (23%) in homicide rates from 2002 to 2011, compared to communities with less than 100,000 residents.	From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide incidents involved a single victim. In 2011, 66% of homicides with a single victim involved a firearm, compared to 79% of homicide incidents with multiple victims.

                        What Do Clinicians Need to Understand
                        Assessments, Screenings and Guidelines for Clinicians
                        America’s unique gun culture has dire consequences. The U.S. has the most firearms per capita in the world. Despite having only half the population of the other 22 high-income nations combined, data suggests that the U.S. accounts for 82% of all firearm deaths globally, and that the U.S. accounts for 90% of all women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, and 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years who were killed by firearms worldwide (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016). Moreover, while the overall suicide rate in the U.S. is on par with other high-income nations, the gun suicide rate in America is eight times higher (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).
                        senting a 12% surge in gun deaths.
                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques
                        When patients admit to homicidal ideation, mental health providers ask the following questions to assess risk (Pinard & Pagani, 2001):

                            Is there an identifiable victim - a specific person(s) or a specific location, such as an office building?
                            Does the patient have a plan? Is the plan rational and lethal? Has there been any progression in planning?
                            Does he or she have access to the intended weapon?
                            Is the victim available, e.g. does the patient have access to him or her?
                            Has the patient taken steps to practice or prepare? For example, if the patient fantasizes about releasing a round of bullets at his previous place of work, has he engaged in any preliminary behaviors such as stalking, obtaining worker schedules, or creating a drawing of the building layout?
                            What, if anything, stops the patient from acting on his or her violent thoughts?

                        Questions like these can help determine if a patient needs to be evaluated in the inpatient setting or if the evaluation can be safely conducted in the outpatient setting.
                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques (Contd)
                        Also helpful in evaluating dangerousness are questions that address risk factors for violent behavior (Derefinko et al., 2011; Pinard & Pagani, 2001), such as:

                            Does the patient have a history of violent behavior toward people or animals? Does the patient have a criminal record?
                            Does the patient display problems with impulse control?
                            Has the patient ever been diagnosed with Axis I or Axis II disorders? If so, what disorder(s)?
                            If the patient is prescribed psychopharmacological medications, what are they? Has he or she been taking the medications as prescribed?
                            Is the patient abusing alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescribed medications?
                            If the patient receives services from a primary care physician or psychiatrist, when was he or she last seen?
                            What if any sources or recent events have occurred that might lead to major disappointment or anger?

                        Violent sprees are often preceded by a trigger related to losses or perceived rejections, such as a breakup, being fired from a job, or being rejected for admission into a college or the military (Pinard & Pagani, 2001).
                        Adjunct consultation with other health providers, such as the patient’s primary care physician, will often provide valuable information about the patient’s prescribed medications, adherence to medications, psychiatric history, medical problems, and family history.
                        Guidelines for Clinicians
                        Reasons for Psychiatric Evaluation
                        A history of substance abuse, head injury, or a mental health disorder with the potential for psychotic thinking (e.g. mania, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, delusional disorder, and dementia) may be associated with detriments in self-control and should therefore be considered a strong indicator for immediate psychiatric evaluation. In addition, when a patient has made a direct threat of intent to harm, psychiatric evaluation should be obtained. Forced psychiatric evaluation raises issues related to morality (Bennett et al. 1993) and civil liberties (Testa & West, 2010).

                        Points to Ponder

                            Given the disparities in homicide rates across different demographic groups, how can healthcare professionals ensure they approach these statistics without bias, and provide equitable care and assessment for all patients, regardless of their demographic background?
                            How can mental health professionals effectively balance the need for safety precautions and risk assessments with maintaining trust and therapeutic rapport with their patients, especially when discussing topics as sensitive as violent ideation and firearm accessibility?
                            Considering the U.S. gun culture and the alarming statistics surrounding firearm deaths, how might healthcare professionals address the topic of firearm safety in therapeutic settings without triggering defensiveness or resistance, and promote a dialogue that prioritizes the well-being of the patient and the community?

                        Mental Health and Risk for Violent Behavior
                        Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. This finding is robust even when other risk factors are controlled, such as being male, growing up in a violent neighborhood, and being less educated (Link et al., 1992; Swanson et al., 1990).
                        Personality Disorders
                        Psychological disorders are quite common among violent individuals, especially Cluster B Personality Disorders: Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). 
                        While in most cases the suspicions of individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) provoke only insults and lawsuits, in a small number of cases they can foment violence (Tardiff, 2001). The key DSM 5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for these disorders are summarized in the page titled–Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence.
                        Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence
                        Antisocial Personality Disorder
                        Thrill-seeking, reckless, impulsive, deceitful, irritable, aggressive, irresponsible, violates the law, lacks remorse, and has a history of violence toward animals and/or people
                        Narcissistic Personality Disorder
                        Histrionic Personality Disorder
                        Borderline Personality Disorder

                        Dangerous Hallucinations 
                        Not all hallucinations carry the same risk for violence; some types of hallucinations are associated with a greater risk. Auditory “command” hallucinations that tell the patient to hurt him/herself or hurt another are significantly associated with potential future violence (Barrowcliff & Haddock, 2010). Visual hallucinations can also be dangerous.

                        Gellerman and Suddath (2005) reviewed court decisions on the matter and concluded “…the courts considered the expression of violent fantasies to be an indication that the patients were potentially dangerous, particularly in the context of having a history of violent or threatening behavior (p. 486).” To clarify, providers were not typically held responsible for failing in the duty to warn in the case of violent fantasy without a history of violence. There were some exceptions.

                        Important Guiding Studies
                        The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study
                        The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was tasked with assembling the current knowledge about violent risk assessment and creating an actuarial model that could successfully predict violence and be developed into a computer-based decision tree for practitioners. 
                        The MacArthur team interviewed male and female patients (N = 1,136) between the ages of 18 and 40 during an acute civil inpatient hospitalization who had a chart diagnosis of thought or affective disorder, substance abuse, or personality disorder. 
                        Participants were interviewed at ten-week intervals for one-year post-discharge to evaluate factors related to risk for violence (The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005)1

                        Findings: The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study
                        The team’s findings about risk factors for violence are highlighted as follows:
                        Gender: Violence by Men Vs. Violence by Women
                        Men were somewhat more likely than women to be violent, but the difference was not large. Violence by women was more likely than violence by men to be directed against family members and to occur at home, and less likely to result in medical treatment or arrest.

                        These findings from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study led to the development of the measure, The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree (ICT; The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005). The ICT will be discussed in more detail when we turn our discussion to assessment measures.

                        Premorbid and Contemporaneous Clinical Factors
                        Example of Two Patients
                        Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Van Dorn et al. (2012) conducted a large two-wave study of mental illness and violence. 
                        They concluded, “...there is a statistically significant, yet modest relationship between recent serious mental illness (SMI) (within 12 months) and violence, and a stronger relationship between SMI with substance use disorder and violence. 
                        Extrapolating from Van Dorn et al.’s work, it may be that to date the prediction of violence in clinical settings has failed largely due to the complexity of the predictive equation.
                        Evaluating the Potential for Violent Behaviour
                        Litwach et al. (2006) note that too little research has been conducted on psychiatric patients hospitalized for violent behavior, but they do provide a list of risk factors for violent behavior based on empirical studies currently available. This list serves as a good summary guide for mental health providers when evaluating a patient’s potential for dangerous behavior (p 503). According to their review, Litwach et al. (2006) suggest the most important risk factors to attend to include:

                            Active psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, plus a history of violence or current hostile attitudes
                            The presence of delusional beliefs about significant others and specific personal targets, especially that a significant other has been replaced by an imposter
                            Severe and chronic self-destructiveness
                            Command hallucinations to commit violence when the hallucinated voice is identified; when there is also a delusion related to the hallucination; or when the content of the hallucination includes reference to self-harm
                            Erotomania with multiple delusional objects and a history of serious antisocial behavior unrelated to delusions
                            Recent and currently active narcissistic injury; isolation of affect or grossly inappropriate affect; threatening or provocative behavior, which is usually minimized by the patient; and the availability of a weapon.

                        Psychopathy and Homicide Typology
                        Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. It is worth making a clear clinical distinction between the two. Let’s begin with psychopathy and then contrast it with homicide typology.

                        Dimensions that Define Psychopathy
                        Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised
                        Psychopathy, the first personality disorder listed in the DSM, was later subsumed by the current Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD). Curiously, many forensic specialists have retained the use of the term psychopathy for those whose affect and behavior suggest a level of deviance beyond that of the typical Antisocial individual. In other words, psychopathy can be thought of as the worst of the worst.
                        Table 3. The 4 Key Factors of Hare’s PCL-R
                        Factor 1

                        Two other items, promiscuous sexual behavior, and many short-term relationships, do not statistically load on any factor but contribute to the total PCL-R score.
                        Adapted from Hare & Neumann (2008)
                        A Psychopath's Sketch
                        Based on Hare’s list of psychopathy traits, the psychopath’s interpersonal style would appear glib and superficial, manipulative and cunning. His shallow effect belies an inability to empathize or feel guilt for wrongdoing. An appealing veneer often obscures these character deficiencies. He is a con artist, a charlatan - not what he seems to be. The psychopath behaves in impulsive and irresponsible ways that feed an excessive hunger for stimulation. This can lead to trouble. While some psychopaths find a home in careers that reward risk-taking and cold efficiency, many end up in prison or leading a parasitic life on the fringes of society. In any case, the psychopath’s life is marked by failed relationships, numerous improprieties, and, sometimes, acts of violence.

                        If psychopathy can be reduced to abnormalities in brain anatomy and function, can we blame psychopaths for their actions? Are these abnormalities congenital and/or developmentally acquired? How does this information affect treatment approaches with psychopaths? The list of ethical, clinical, and biological questions generated by such findings goes on and on. The questions will grow even more complex as brain imaging and the study of genetics advances.

                        Role of Mental Health Providers
                        Other Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Homicide
                        The Most Common Method
                        Given the recent phenomena of T.V. programs like CSI and Criminal Minds, many people are familiar with the concept of profiling. Profilers make use of psychological research on violent crime and criminals to enhance law enforcement efforts. One specific way researchers study violence is to study the perpetrators of specific types of crime. As you’ll see below, much work has been done on three types of homicide, intimate partner homicide, spree killing/mass murder, and serial killing.
                        Intimate Partner Homicide (Contd)
                        A history of non-fatal strangulation is also a significant risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Glass and colleagues (2007) found that “women who were victims of completed or attempted homicide were far more likely to have a history of strangulation [p. 332]” when compared with controls. 
                        Moreover, women with a history of being strangled had seven times the odds of becoming a victim of attempted homicide. It is important, therefore, that mental health providers inquire specifically about choking and attempted strangulation when evaluating homicide risk.
                        Profiling Intimate Partner Killers
                        Role of Mental Health Provider
                        Things to Do
                        There is no clear profile of intimate partner killers, although insecure attachment patterns, cultural factors, childhood exposure to parental intimate partner violence, and external stressors have been implicated (Elisha et al., 2010). In light of the statistics and the consequences for harm, mental healthcare providers should regularly assess their male patients for perpetrator status. While men are somewhat reluctant to admit to current intimate partner violence, they are more willing to admit to past violence, and this may be used as a prevention measure. Additionally, men are more willing to admit to perpetrating violence anonymously; however, data from this type of assessment are less likely to result in effective prevention (Jaeger et al., 2008).
                        Spree Killing or Mass Murder
                        The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders (FBI 8, 2008). The term “mass murder” is sometimes used when the homicides occur in one location.
                        Profile of Spree Killers
                        The Motivation
                        In general, spree killers have an identifiable profile. They are most often white, middle-class males, single or divorced. They tend to be paranoid and depressive and have Cluster A or B personality disorders (i.e., Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal, Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic) or features of those disorders (Hare, 1993; Pinard & Pagani, 2001)
                        Structured Assessment Measures
                        Relatively little attention has been paid to risk assessment and prevention even though homicide is a leading cause of death in the U.S. While mental health professionals cannot definitively predict homicide, violence prevention in some cases may be enhanced through accurate mental health diagnosis and the use of objective screening measures or algorithms, especially in the cases of intimate partner violence and mass murder.
                        Premorbid Environmental Factors
                        Standard Measures
                        Clinicians who navigate the murky waters of assessing dangerousness need to consider premorbid environmental factors, such as childhood victimization, exposure to violence, and parental neglect; current environmental factors, such as negative peer influences, neighborhood violence, and reduced access to treatment; and clinical factors, such as severity of symptomology, symptom stability, co-morbid diagnoses, whether there is a history violent behavior, alcohol and/or substance abuse, the degree of insight, and the presence or absence of hostility (Van Dorn et al., 2012; Monahan et al., 2005). Clinicians should be aw
                        Structured Assessment Measures: Adult Measures
                        When assessing risk for violent behavior among adults, sole reliance on unstructured clinical judgments or clinical intuition is strongly ill-advised; use of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and/or other well-validated measures is recommended as standard care (Gendreau et al., 2006; Hare, 2006; Monahan et al., 2001; Quinsey et al., 2006).
                        The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R)

                        Static 2002R
                        The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare & Neumann, 2006) is the most used tool in the forensic psychologist’s bag. The PCL-R was initially developed to derive a clinical construct of psychopathy. The checklist’s 20 items load on four factors or dimensions - Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, and Antisocial - described in detail earlier in the course and summarized in Table 3. The test can be administered by a non-expert in an interview setting, and can take anywhere from a few minutes to much longer, depending on the patient’s history and whether there is any difficulty obtaining case history from external sources, such as parents or prison records.
                        are of the signs and symptoms of psychopathy as well so that they can advise potential victims and seek hospitalization for potential perpetrators.
                        Measures Specific to Intimate Partner Violence
                        The field of intimate partner violence (IPV) risk assessment (predicting recidivism and lethality) has been rapidly growing, with the majority of research conducted in the past decade. When assessing intimate partner violence (IPV), some measures are directed toward perpetrators, and some are directed toward victims of abuse.

                        Spousal Assault Risk Assessment (SARA)
                        The Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA; e.g., Hilton et al., 2004; Hilton et al., 2010) was created from research on nearly 600 cases of reported IPV and contains 13 yes/no questions that predict the risk of future assault with relatively high accuracy using these questions alone. Thus, it reduces the need for a comprehensive assessment to evaluate the risk of re-offense by male perpetrators.
                        Measures Specific to Intimate Partner Violence
                        Victim-Directed Measures
                        HITS Scale
                        DA Scale

                        Limitations of the Instruments
                        Findings on Limitations
                        There are many helpful scales available to assess victim risk. One such scale is the HITS (Sherin et al., 1998), which involves asking the patient about the frequency with which his or her partner has “H” art, “I” insulted, “T” threatened, or “S” creamed. Answers to the four questions are provided using a 5- 5-point Likert-type scale (1=Never to 5=Frequently), yielding a total score.
                        The HITS is a validated instrument and a popular screen for the primary care setting because it is quick and easy to use. More information about the HITS links to a PDF of the measure and scoring instructions are available to view online1, but be mindful that the HITS is copyrighted and available for public use and can only be reproduced with the author’s permissio

                        PCL-R & PCL-YV
                        Copelan et al. (2006) devised and validated an algorithm, known as the Violence Ideation and Suicidality Treatment Algorithm (VISTA), for emergency department physicians to use in identifying adolescents at risk of serious violent behavior (See Table 5 on the next page). Using VISTA, adolescents could be successfully identified as being at low, intermediate, or high risk for violent behavior with a detection sensitivity of 80.3% and a specificity of 98.1%.
                        Lesson Summary
                        The key points that were covered in this module are:

                            Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the contemporary mental health and criminology landscape.
                            The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations, with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.
                            Psychiatric admission can be voluntary or involuntary. Mental health professionals often play a pivotal role in initiating involuntary assessment and hospitalization.
                            Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse.
                            Mental health providers should be diligent in monitoring patients who suffer from disorders that can result in heightened paranoia and suspiciousness or other disturbances of thought, such as paranoid schizophrenia, dementia with frontal involvement, and, in some cases, organic brain disease. 
                            Since a delusion is a false notion inconsistent with the person’s background that is held with great conviction despite clear evidence to the contrary on a fundamental level, all delusions impair judgment, but not all delusions are imminently dangerous.
                            Fantasies, or daydreams, are distinguished from delusions by the patient’s control over their content, initiation, and cessation.

                The acronym DHCP stands for what Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a client/server protocol that enables configured client computers to obtain IP addresses automatically.
                DHCP uses port numbers Port 67 and Port 68.
                IP addresses obtained using DHCP may contain the following information:
                • Subnet masks.
                • Gateway addresses.
                • DNS server addresses.
                The DHCP server provides the following benefits:
                • Reliable IP addresses configuration.

                    Routing is the process of managing the flow of data between network segments and between hosts or routers. 

                    The following are types of routing: 
                    • Static routing - A path that is manually configured and remains constant throughout the router’s operation.
                    • Dynamic routing - A path that is generated dynamically by using special routing protocols.

                    The following are the conceptual parts of dynamic routing: 
                    • Routing protocol.
                    • Routing algorithm.

                    Common Dynamic Routing protocols: 
                    •  Distance Vector routing - Routing Information Protocol (RIP). 
                    •  Link State routing - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).

                    Examples of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs): 
                    • Routing Information Protocol (RIP).
                    • Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).

                    Routing Information Protocols calculates the direction that packets should be forwarded to and the distance from the destination. 

                    Interior Gateway Protocols - Routing protocols that were designed for use within Autonomous Systems.
                    Upon successful completion of this module you will be able to:

    Lesson Summary
    The CPU is probably the most important hardware resource arguably the second most important hardware resource is the memory.
    Models for managing memory.
    Single Contiguous Model
    Partition Model
    Limitations of Both
    In this model, only one process occupies RAM at a time.
    When one process completes, another process is allocated to RAM.
    Process memory size is restricted by RAM size.
    Modern day operation systems do much better in managing memory using two concepts virtual memory and segmentation.

    Lesson Summary

        Virtual memory does not split programs into logical modules, instead it splits programs into fixed size blocks. Segmentation splits program into segments that are more logical.
        The segment size could range from a few bytes to maximum size (4GB in a 32 bit machine would be max size)
        Segmentation can lead to fragmentation – memory space is available but not contiguous.
        When address Mapping with Segmentation there would be at least three registers and a Segment descriptor table. That the registers will select form to assign segments to RAM.
        When address mapping with segmentation you would have a Segment descriptor table, and at least three registers; Segment selector, offset register and pointer to descriptor table.
        An x86 systems memory management is broken into two parts the segmentation and paging. X86 have two descriptor tables local and global stored in memory. The segment descriptor has three parts; base address, limit and access rights.
        XV6 is an operating system targeted for x86 processor platforms. It was created by MIT for teaching operating system development. XV6 only creates four segments these are Kernel code, kernel data User code, User Data.
        Each segment descriptor in x86 system has 64 bits, some of the important attributes of the segment descriptor would be: base, limit, type and privilege level.
        XV6 is not the best memory management scheme possible, but reprehensive of what several Operating system do to actually manage memory.
        In a xv6 system the entire RAM is mapped into kernel, memory mapped devices are also mapped into kernel space. The kernel, can covert the virtual address to a physical one and do the opposite. MS Office 2013 Transition

                Lesson Summary
                    The start screen is a new feature in MS Office 2013. In Powerpoint, there are Themes immediately available or you can make a search using the search button. Themes are not templates with data, a Theme is just a look that lets you add data.
                    The presenter view in 2013 comes with enhanced features like the timer capability. You can look at the current slide, switch or view what the next slide is going to look like without the audience seeing that. You can see the slide notes, quick new buttons to increase/decrease the font of those notes on the slide. Pen and laser capabilities, navigation grid, new ways to zoom in and out, and blacken the screen during a presentation.
                    Presenter view lets you view your presentation with your speaker notes on one computer while the audience views the notes-free presentation on a different monitor. In Powerpoint 2013, from within the presentation, hold down the ALT key and hit 5 and it should take you to Presenter View.
                    In Powerpoint 2013, you have the ability to invite people to look at your presentation. To collaborate on a single presentation, open your PowerPoint presentation, at the top-right corner of the menu, select ‘Share’, and select ‘Invite People’. Enter the email address of the person you'd like to share the presentation with and click Share.
                    In Powerpoint 2013, each slide may have multiple items such as pictures, shapes, and text boxes. You can arrange the objects by aligning, ordering, grouping, and rotating them in various ways. When you move objects in PowerPoint, alignment guides and spacing guides will appear around the objects to help you align them. PowerPoint provides you with several alignment commands that allow you to easily arrange and position objects.

                    Lesson Summary
                        Access 2013 features a new application model that enables you to quickly create web-based applications. Included with Access are a set of templates that you can use to jump-start creating your application.
                        To utilize the Web App feature, open MS Access, choose Custom web app, enter a name and the web location for your app. You can also choose a location from the Locations list and choose 'Create'. Type Issues into the ‘What would you like to track?’ box, then press Enter and Choose Issues.
                        One enhanced feature of MS Access is Templates. You now have a broad array of database application templates to choose from or source from the web, giving you some suggested categories as well. These help you save time in creating your applications.
                        In MS Access 2013, each template is designed to meet specific data management needs and you can either use one of the templates included with Access or find one online. Click on a Template to get a description of the template with ratings, give the template a name, and choose where you would like to store it, then hit Create. This will create a new database with the assigned name, basing it on the template selected. Hit create and it will take you straight to the newly created application.
                        A Microsoft Access template is a file that, when opened, creates a complete database application. These templates are designed to be complete end-to-end database solutions, saving you time and effort and enabling you to start using your database right away. The database is ready to use and contains all the tables, forms, reports, queries, macros, and relationships that you need to start working. You can customize a database after creating it using a template, to better suit your needs, just as if you had built the database from scratch.

                        Lesson Summary
                            In Outlook 2013, you can have quick access to these four primary areas. It used to be if you wanted to go to any one of these areas you had to completely leave another area, but in Outlook 2013, you’ll notice at the bottom and click on one of the four without having to leave your inbox.
                            Microsoft Outlook is a personal information manager software system from Microsoft, available as a part of the Microsoft Office suite. Though primarily an email client, Outlook also includes such functions as calendaring, task managing, contact managing, note-taking, journal logging, and web browsing. Outlook allows you to send and receive email messages, manage your calendar, store names and numbers of your contacts, and track your tasks. However, even if you use Outlook every day, you might not know some of the cool things it can do to help you be more productive.
                            Microsoft has finally incorporated social networking into their products in 2013. Microsoft has given you a connect capability for all of the most popular networks (LinkedIn, Facebook etc.) To connect social networks in Outlook 2013, launch Outlook, go to File, under Info, click on Account Settings, you’ll have an option to connect a social account there.
                            One of the nicest features added is the capacity to remind you or to anticipate things you should be doing that you’ve forgotten. An example is when you indicated in an email that you were going to attach a file and you forget to, Outlook will bring up an attachment reminder saying (you may have forgotten to attach a file), basically reminding you.
                            The People Card collects all the key details about a contact in one place: phone, email, address, company info, social media updates, even whether they're available. People Card is like an electronic business cards that allow you to organize and keep track of everyone you communicate with in Outlook. To open, click People in the Navigation bar.

        Image 81: Quantum computing
        Qubits can do simultaneous computations because they can exist in various states. Quantum computing might transform encryption, AI, and molecular modelling. Quantum computers might break ordinary encryption protocols, necessitating quantum-resistant encryption. Quantum computing might train machine learning models quicker and more accurately than ordinary computers, improving AI algorithms. Quantum computing can simulate atoms and molecules in molecular modelling, allowing medicine and material creation. Quantum computing is still developing, and qubit stability and computation error reduction are major concerns. Despite these challenges, quantum computing has many exciting applications and is expected to change the technology industry in the future.

        Lesson Summary
            The quest for artificial intelligence began with dreams as all quest do. People have long imagined machines endowed with human abilities 
            Leonardo Da Vinci sketched designs for a humanoid robot in the form of a medieval knight around the year 1495
            Frank Baum in 1900 invented one of the literary world's most beloved robot in the Wonderful Wizard of Oz 
            Artificial intelligence is the field devoted to building artefacts capable of displaying behaviours that we consider to be intelligent 
            Alan Turing published a landmark paper in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines with true intelligence
            Weak artificial intelligence aims at building machines that act intelligently 
            Strong artificial intelligence is the field devoted to building "persons"
            Artificial intelligence problems span a very broad spectrum
            One of the few hard and fast results to come out of the first three decades of artificial intelligence research is the realization that intelligence requires knowledge 
            To build a system to solve a particular problem, we have to do four things, including: Define the problem precisely, Analyze the problem, Isolate and represent task knowledge, Choose the best problem solving techniques

            Lesson Summary
                In artificial intelligence, a heuristic is a function that estimates how close a state is to a goal 
                The heuristic function takes a state and returns an estimate of its distance from a goal state 
                Heuristics can help speed up exhaustive, blind search, such as depth first and breadth first search 
                A standard approach for creating heuristics is problem relaxation 
                Heuristics created as solutions to relaxed problems are usually admissible 
                A heuristic is admissible if it never underestimates the cost of reaching a goal from any node 
                The only thing required for a heuristic to be admissible is that it never returns a value greater than the actual cost path 
                A composite heuristic will take more time to compute but would be very accurate 
                Heuristics have a trade off between quality of estimate and work per node 
                Best first search is a way of combining the advantages and disadvantages of both depth first and breadth first search into a single method 
                Drawbacks of hill climbing include: Local maxima, Plateau, and Ridges 
                A hill climbing algorithm that never makes a downhill move is guaranteed to be incomplete because it can get stuck in a local maximum

                Lesson Summary
                    Knowledge representation and reasoning is concerned with how an agent uses what it knows in deciding what to do
                    Knowledge representation is an essential problem of of symbolic based artificial intelligence 
                    The physical symbol system hypothesis is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence 
                    Knowledge may be represented as symbol structures. Intelligent behaviour can be achieved through manipulation of symbol structures 
                    Representation is a relationship between two domains where the first is meant to stand for or take the place of the second 
                    Knowledge representation is a medium for pragmatically efficient computation
                    Knowledge representation is a sub area of artificial intelligence concerned with understanding, designing, and implementing, ways of representing in computers information in computers so that programs can use this information
                    Computational models of intelligence requires models of knowledge 
                    Desired features of knowledge representation languages include: Epistemological level, Logical level, Implementation level
                    A logic is a formal language with precisely defined syntax and semantics

                    Lesson Summary
                        Formalization of knowledge in a declarative form begins with conceptualization 
                        The notions of interpretation and variable assignments are important because they allow us to define a a relative notion of truth called satisfaction 
                        The satisfiability of logical sentences depends on the logical operators involved 
                        Universally quantified sentence is satisfied if and only if the enclosed statement is satisfied for all assignments of the quantified variables 
                        Existentially quantified sentence is satisfied if an only if the enclosed statement is satisfied for some assignments of the quantified variables 
                        Axioms are facts and rules that attempt to capture all of the important facts about a domain 
                        While representing declarative knowledge, we write sentences we believe to be true; ones that are satisfied by our intended interpretation
                        Formally, a conceptualization is a triple consisting of a universe of discourse, a functional basis set for that universe of discourse, and a relational basis set 
                        There exist well understood mechanisms for making inferences from predicate calculus well formed formulas 
                        A theorem is a well formed formula that can be proven true on the basis of the axioms 
                        Reasoning in logic based artificial intelligence system is accomplished by using methods of mathematical proof

                        Lesson Summary
                            Resolution is an important rule of inference that can be applied to a certain class of well formed formulas called clauses 
                            The resolution trace is a sequence of annotated clauses separated into levels 
                            Resolution is used in demonstrating unsatisfiability 
                            Demonstrating unsatisfiability for a set of clauses can also be used to demonstrate that a formula is logically implied by a set of formula 
                            Resolution is sound in the that any clause that can be derived from a database using resolution is logically implied by that database 
                            Rule of inference called paramodulation when added to resolution principle guarantees refutation completeness even when involving inequality
                            The final statement of the modified proof tree depends on the upon the refutation which is replicated 
                            Resolution does not provide a general effective solution to the reasoning problem 
                            Most general unifier preserves as much generality as possible for a pair of formulas; by using the most general unifier we leave maximum flexibility for the resolvent to resolve with other clauses 
                            In the breadth first search, all of the first level resolvents are computed first, then the second level resolvents and so on
                            The breadth first strategy is complete but grossly inefficient

                            Lesson Summary
                                Probability theory provides the basis for our treatment os systems that reason under uncertainty 
                                Utility theory provides ways and means of weighing up the desirability of goals and the likelihood of achieving them 
                                Probability theory and utility theory put together constitute decision theory 
                                In logical agents approach, agents almost never have access to the whole truth about their environment 
                                Uncertainty can also arise because of incompleteness and incorrectness in the agent's understanding of the properties of the environment 
                                Trying to use first order logic to cope with complex domains fail because of three main reasons: Laziness, Theoretical ignorance, Practical ignorance
                                A continuous random variable is a random variable that takes an infinite number of distinct variables 
                                The process of Bayesian updates incorporates evidence one piece at a time, modifying the previously held believe in the unknown variable 
                                Conditional independence brought about by direct casual relationships in the domain allows Bayesian updates to work effectively with multiple piece of evidence 
                                Axioms on of probabilities specify constraints on reasonable assignments of probabilities to propositions

                            Lesson Summary
                                Planning is reasoning about future events in order to establish a series of actions to accomplish a goal 
                                A common approach to planning is representing a current state and determining the series of necessary actions required to reach the goal state 
                                Plans are created by searching through a space of possible actions until the sequence necessary to accomplish the task is discovered 
                                Planning and problem solving are different because of the differences in the representation of goals, states and actions, the differences in the representation and construction of action sequences 
                                Planning and problem solving methods can often solve the the same sorts of problems 
                                Situation calculus is a dialect of first order logic in which beliefs about a changing world can be represented 
                                Situation calculus enables a knowledge based agent to reason about the results of actions
                                STRIPS is an alternative representation to the pure situation calculus for planning 
                                For convenience, problems are typically specified via action schemas rather than writing out individuals STRIPS actions
                                The original STRIPS system used a goal stack to control its search 
                                Goal stack planning is not complete. It can terminate without finding a plan 
                                Goal stack planning breaks up a set of goal predicates into individual subgoals and attempts to solve them individually one after the other

                                Lesson Summary
                                    Real world domains are complex and don't satisfy the assumption of STRIPS or partial order planning methods 
                                    Hierarchical decomposition or hierarchical task network planning uses abstract operators to incrementally decompose a planning problem 
                                    Primitive operators represent actions that are executable and can appear in the final plan 
                                    Operators with conditional effect have different effects depending on what the world is like when they are executed 
                                    A disjunctive effect is used to model random effects or effects that are determined by the preconditions of the operators 
                                    A transition model is a specification of the outcome probabilities of each action in each possible state 
                                    The problem of calculating an optimal policy in an accessible, stochastic environment with a known transition model is known as a Markov decision problem
                                    Markov property holds if the transition probabilities from any given state depend only on the state and not on previous history 
                                    Markov decision process is a specification of a sequential decision problem for a fully observable environment that satisfies the Markov assumption and yields additive rewards
                                    Value iteration is an algorithm for computing an optimal policy

                                    Machine learning addresses the fundamental question of how to build computer programs that could learn automatically from experience
                                    Machine learning is the most rapidly expanding technical field in the intersection of statistics and computer science and lies at the core of artificial intelligence
                                    The rapid progress in machine learning is because of the development of new algorithms, theory of learning and the ongoing explosion in availability of data and low cost computation
                                    The adoption of machine learning methods in science, engineering and technology and commerce have actually led to data intensive decision making in domains as diverse as healthcare, manufacturing, education financial projections, agriculture policing and many others
                                    Artificial intelligence is demonstrated when a task, previously performed by a human and thought of as requiring the ability to learn, reason and solve problems is being performed by a machine 
                                    Intelligence is the ability to solve problems 
                                    Artificial intelligence and machine learning are often used interchangeably
                                    Machine learning is a subset of of artificial intelligence and focuses on the ability of machines to receive a set of data and learn for themselves 
                                    Machine learning philosophy is to automate the creation of analytical models in order to enable algorithms to learn continuously with the help of available data

    Projective Geometry and Homography

        A point in a 2D projective space is represented by a ray passing through the origin of an implicit 3D space.
        Points and lines hold a duality theorem: An intersection of two points form a line, and the intersection of two lines form a point.
        A straight line in a 2D real space can be expressed as an element of a 2D projective space.
        Conics are represented by a 3x3 symmetric matrix; every conic has a dual conic or line conic as an envelope of its tangent.
        A projective transformation is defined as a transformation of a point in a projective space to another point in a projective space.
        A projective transformation is invertible, preserves collinearity and is always in a linear form.

    Subgroups and Hierarchy of a projective group include:

        Projective linear group
        Affine group
        Euclidean group
        Oriented Euclidean group

        Camera Geometry
            A pinhole camera model provides the projection matrix which maps a 3D point to an image point.
            The centre of a camera lies at infinity.
            The images in an affine projection are formed by parallel rays.
            A projection matrix is a 3x4 matrix with 11 independent parameters.
        Various forms of a projection matrix are:
           P = [ M | P4 ]   or   P = [ P1 P2 P3 P4 ]
        Images of vanishing points:
          X-axis: P1
          Y-axis: P2
          Z-axis: P3
          World-Origin: P4


        The vanishing point of a line with direction d is given as Md.
        Stereo Geometry - Part 1
        In Epipolar geometry, the epipoles, scene point, corresponding image points and camera centres all lie on the same plane.
        A Fundamental matrix characterizes a stereo setup and is unique to that stereo setup. Its properties include:
            Transformation Invariant
            3x3 Matrix with 7 independent parameters
            Given an image point x, its epipolar line L = Fx
            Given camera matrices (P, P'), F is unique.
        Given camera matrices (P, P') and a corresponding pair of image points (X, X'), it is possible to reconstruct the respective 3D scene point X.
        Given a Fundamental matrix F there exists a family of stereo setups (Pair of camera matrices).

        E is an Essential matrix, if two of its singular values are equal and the third is zero.
        E = [t]xR, given ([I | 0], [R | t])
        [t]x and  R can be computed through the decomposition of E s.t.  E = SR where S is skew-symmetric matrix and R is orthogonal.
        Given a set pair of corresponding points, it is possible to estimate F.
        Given a set pair of corresponding points, it is possible to estimate camera matrices and scene points, up to projective (4x4 homography matrix) ambiguity.
        Given a set pair of corresponding line l and l' and camera matrices (P, P') it is possible to reconstruct respective 3D line L.
        An Affine epipolar geometry, simplifies the structure of a Fundamental matrix.

            Color Fundamentals
                Colour is a psychological property of our visual experience when we look at objects and light.
                Colour is a piece of important information for interpreting images and videos.
                Colour is mostly captured in the RGB colour space, although this space isn't the most suitable for direct interpretation of colour components such as Saturation and Hue.
                The CIE chromaticity chart represents color in a 2D space.
                In digital cameras, coloured images are captured using a Colour Filter Array (CFA) which needs to be interpolated to provide full-colour information.
            Other Colour spaces for colour processing include:

            Manufacturing is defined as a series of interrelated activities and operations involving the design, materials selection, planning, manufacturing production, quality assurance, management, and marketing of the products of the manufacturing industries.

            Manufacturing is a combination of two Latin words: 'Manus' which means 'Hand', and 'Facio' which means 'To do'.

            The Goals of Manufacturing are:
                The manufacturing process should be quick and timesaving.
                The manufacturing process should be cost-effective.
                The manufactured products should be of high quality.
                The output of the manufacturing process should be diverse.
            These goals in some cases may be conflicting. A manufacturing company might forgo one or more of these goals in order to achieve another of them.

                            In this module you learned:

                                The reasons why toy models work in polymer physics is because of the results, the simplicity of the scaling laws and their application for such a variety of cases such that many different models will give you the same results.

                                If a molecule has a higher stiffness, it will also have a higher value of persistence length.

                                In certain polymer theories like the freely jointed model, we often use parameter to characterize the stiffness of the polymer chain.

                                There is a better model for the chains that are not really flexible and this is known as the worm-like chain or Kratky-Porod model.

                                There are four cases that prevent rotations in chains which are stiff. These are: delocalization of valence electrons, hydrogen bonding between chain segments, strongly charged polyelectrolyte and a bulky side group present on the polymer chain.
                                We cannot do a Tailor expansion if the theta value is large, as it only works when the theta value is small.

        Radius of Gyration
        In this module you learned:


            As the temperature is raised, the entropy of the system increases, as it will want to go to a higher entropy state.

            The steps to be taken when carrying out simulations are: simulate many chain conformations, compute their Re-squared and take the average.
            When we are solving for the concentration of any species as a function of a spatial location and time, this is known as the Fick’s law of diffusion.
            In the Einstein notation, alpha can be a free index (not repeated) or a dummy index (repeated).

            The radius of gyration is one of the quantities that characterize the size of a polymer chain.

            The radiation of gyration tells something directly about the size of a polymer chain.
            If you want to look at features which are less than 1 micron, the optical microscope will not be enough. In that case you have to make use of what is known as light scattering.

            In a polymer chain, the end to end distance does not reflect the fact that the polymer occupies a certain amount of volume in space.

            Bonded interactions vary with the distance along the contour and non-bonded interactions vary with physical distance.

        Fractal Nature of Polymers
        In this module you learned:


            If the attractions are attractive, they want to come together which results in the lowering of energy. If they are repulsive they come together which gives rise to an increase in energy.

            The Flory theory gives us the scaling laws for both the good solvent case and the poor solvent case.

            A two body interaction refers to pairs of segments that come close to each other, while a three body interaction refers to three segments that come close to each other.

            Virial expansion is one of the most common tactics in thermodynamics that is used to look at the interaction between objects.

            Whenever we say that the energy is a sum of the two contributions, we are actually making an approximation that is known as an additivity approximation.

            The three body interaction that we have ignored for the good solvent case, becomes important for the bad solvent case. 

            When we are doing the Flory theory for the bad solvent or poor solvent, we do again the approximation that the total energy is additive and we can add the elastic energy and the interaction energy.

            The two features that a polymer chain shares with many other objects are self-similarity and fractal

                Virial expansion is one of the most common tactics in thermodynamics that is used to look at the interaction between objects.

                Whenever we say that the energy is a sum of the two contributions, we are actually making an approximation that is known as an additivity approximation.

                The three body interaction that we have ignored for the good solvent case, becomes important for the bad solvent case. 

                When we are doing the Flory theory for the bad solvent or poor solvent, we do again the approximation that the total energy is additive and we can add the elastic energy and the interaction energy.

            Solution Thermodynamics
            In this module you learned:

                Under the molecular dynamics simulations, we don’t look at the energy of the conformation but, we look at how much force is being experienced by each of the beads using Newton's laws of motion.

                Molecular dynamics simulation captures both static and dynamic properties of chain, whereas the Monte Carlo method does not capture the dynamic behavior, it only captures the static behavior.

                There are also computational advantages of molecular dynamics and one of them is that it can be easily parallelized.

                When defining the volume fraction of solute, we do not refer to the actual volume of molecules but the change in a volume if a molecule is added to a certain volume already present.

                If the phase separation results in a lowering of free energy, the system will phase separate.

                On the other hand if mixing leads to a lowering in free energy the mixing will occur.

                Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane.

                In thermodynamics, the chemical potential of a species is energy that can be absorbed or released due to a change

            Lattice Model of Solutions
            In this module you learned:

                There is no phase separation when f double prime is higher than 0.

                There are two kinds of behaviors that we can have in temperature versus composition space and these are UCST behavior and LCST behavior.

                The classical Hamiltonian is defined in terms of the positions of the constituent particles and their momentum.

                One of the assumptions in the lattice model of solutions is that a solute or a solvent molecule in the system only interacts with its closest neighbors.

                To get the partition function, we simply compute the Boltzmann factors and sum them up.

                The partition function is a generating function for other energy functions.

                The mean field theory is actually an approximation that instead of the different conformations having different energies we assume that all the conformations have a mean energy.

                In the total energy of the system, that energy is composed of solute-solute interactions, solute-solvent interactions and solvent-solvent interactions.
                Brownian Motion
                In this module you learned:

                    The motion of the polymer molecules at equilibrium is known as the Brownian motion.

                    Molecules within a block do not quite move in the direction of the force being applied, they actually have what is known as diffusive motion and convective motion.

                    The motion of molecules is very different compared to the motion of macroscopic objects and the reason why it is different is because the motion at the molecular level is dictated by the kinetic theory or the temperature of the system.

                    The temperature of a system is actually a result of the kinetic energy of the molecules.

                    The Brownian motion is simply a result of thermal fluctuations which in turn comes from the collision of molecules in the system.

                    Fluctuations are not random, they are simply a result of the fact that molecules have different velocities at different times because of the frequent collisions with other molecules in the system.

                    There are two different correlation functions that are used to characterize the magnitude of Brownian motion and these are auto correlation function and cross correlation function.

                    Time reversal symmetry essentially means that a system looks the same if you reverse the flow of tim

                    Continuum Mechanics
                    In this module you learned:

                        The Stokes approximation or low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, is based on the assumptions that the fluid is incomprehensible and the inertial forces are small.

                        Hydrodynamic interactions come from the fact that the force acting on any particular bead, basically results in a flow field around it and that flow field in turn also affects the other particles in the system.

                        Continuum really means that we have a very large number of molecules within the system and any variation within the system can be explained by the notion of control volume.

                        If the material moves, all the material points also move along the material and therefore the material point is not fixed in space; the material point is fixed to the material itself.

                        The stress tensor essentially amounts to the surface force or the force acting on the material point, apart from the body force that is acting on the entire material like gravity.

                        The integration over the volume of the derivative, is the integration over the surface of the stress tensor, multiplied by the normal vector.

                        The condition of mechanical equilibrium is only true when the inertia and body forces are small, in comparison to the forces because of stress.

                        Polymer Rheology
                        In this module you learned:



                            Ultimately the key problem in studying the polymeric system, is not that the equations of motion are not laid out, but that the constitutive equations are difficult to derive.

                            One of the ways of characterizing shear thinning and shear thickening behavior, is what is known as the power law model.

                            The main concept of Rheology, is to know how the stress versus shear rate profile looks, in the case of liquids and solids and how both of them look, in the case of viscoelastic materials.

                            The commercial instrument that is used to measure rheology is called a rheometer.

                            The advantage of applying shear by rotation, is that no matter how high the angular velocity, the thickness of the sample can still be the same and we don’t need a very large setup.

                            The small amplitude oscillatory shear, has the shear varying with time by an oscillatory function.

                            In polymer systems, you do not always have linear elasticity, you can also have nonlinear elasticity.

                            In the Maxwell model, we assume that since the viscoelastic material possesses both a li

        Learning Outcomes
        Upon successful completion of this module, you should be able to:

            Identify the different factors influencing the quality of food during processing and storage.
            Discuss properties must be evaluated in order to assess or assure the quality of raw and processed foods.
            Recognize the role of water in food and its influence on the shelf life of the food materials.
            Identify aspect of food reactions which normally occur in starch-containing foods.
            Summary
            Food quality is a complex concept; it includes the properties like taste, texture, appearance, nutritional value and safety. These properties must be evaluated in order to assess or assure the quality of raw and processed foods. These quality attributes may be evaluated by subjective or sensory methods or objective like instrumental or chemical methods.
            Safety is the first requisite of any food. In broad sense, the food safety is taken to mean that a food is free from any harmful chemical or microbiological contaminant at the time of its consumption.

            Concept of food safety is used in its operational sense for practical reasons. Few examples include; in the canning industry, the commercial sterility as applied to low acid foods is taken to mean the absence of viable spores of clostridium botulinum.

            Some variables need to be controlled during processing and storage operations in order to get the desired quality in the product. The important variables include temperature, time, rate (dT/dt), pH of the ingredients, composition of the product, composition of the gaseous phase and water activity.

            Water is an important component of life, next to oxygen. A person can live for a few weeks without food, but it becomes very difficult to live a few days without water. Water is an integral part of all the animal and vegetable tissues. It is the medium through which different cellular reactions take place. Water helps in almost all body processes like digestion, circulation, excretion, etc. It helps in maintaining the electrolyte balance of the body and plays an important role in the maintenance of the body temperature.

            Lesson Summary
            Browning reactions are important phenomena that occur in many foods when they are exposed to different conditions during processing, handling or storage.

            Browning reactions are complex reactions which occur when many foods are processed. In some cases, the brown colour developed becomes highly desirable and are intimately associated with a delicious high grade product. For example, in case of coffee, bread and other baked products.
            Proteins are macromolecules of great size and complexity. They are of colloidal dimensions, and as such they cannot pass through semipermeable membrane. They are amphoteric in nature; i.e. they behave both as an acid and as a base.
            Food proteins are important to texture, colour, flavor, and functional properties of food. Proteins function as buffering agents, emulsifiers, and fat mimetic agents.

            There are various factors which influence the denaturation process. These factors may be the physical factors, like temperature, high pressure, irradiation, sound waves, and shear forces etc.
            Food preservation techniques have a long history of its use. It was probably first practiced soon after our ancestors developed from hunter gatherer society to initiate primitive farming producing food surpluses and then necessitating extended storage in order to avoid wastage. The earliest used technologies certainly included, for example, drying, curing, fermentation and cooking. Later even simple chemical preservatives, such as burning of sulphur to generate sulphur dioxide to decontaminate fruits prior to its fermentation, were used.
            Lesson Summary
            High pressure processing of foods is organized in two parts. In part 1, the process principle and technological aspects of high pressure processing is discussed, whereas in part 2, the effect of high pressure process parameters on food constituents and its quality.
            High pressure processing (HPP) is a novel method for non-thermal food processing. It is receiving worldwide attention now and is a new concept as compared to the conventional thermal processes. High pressure processing is also termed as hyperbaric pressure, ultra high pressure, high hydrostatic pressure processing or pascalization, etc.

            In HPP, the food is subjected to elevated pressure (up to 900 MPa or 9000 atm) with or without the addition of heat to achieve microbial inactivation, enzymatic inactivation or to alter the food attributes in order to achieve desired qualities.

            Depending upon the process applications, in general to extend the shelf life of the food materials, the microorganisms or enzymes or such other causative agents, which result in the spoilage of food need to be destroyed. During optimization of the process, care should be taken so that there will not be any significant change or alteration or reduction in the quality attributes.

            During HPP, the confirmation of the macro molecules may change depending upon the process conditions i.e. the pressure and other factors. Small molecules, such as color and flavor, etc. are generally not affected.

            Leasson Summary
            Ionizing interactions react with an irradiated material by travelling energy to electrons which are thus raised to a high energy or excited state.
            If the transferred energy is charged enough, the negatively charged electron can leave a molecule with a result that a +ve ion is formed.
            Irradiation creates about one ionization for every two excitations. But, because the ionizations are about a thousand times as likely to cause chemical changes the biological effects caused by the radiations are almost entirely due to this ionization effect.

            Radappertization, you can say that it is a radiation sterilization that is complete removal of the microorganisms or biological forms of the causative agents is targeted here.

            Irradiation is a called a cold process, it is a cold pasteurization or cold sterilization. It can accomplish the same objective as is done by the thermal pasteurization and sterilization processes.

            The food irradiation has very little are no change in the physical appearance of the food, there are no or very minimum or nil textural or color changes in the food; however, there may be some chemical changes into the food and that may if properly not take care of these chemical changes may result into the off flavor, it may result into the softening of the fruits and vegetables or such other problems.

            Lesson Summary
            Freeze drying is also termed as lyophilisation. It is a drying process where the wet product is first frozen to a solid phase and this frozen mass is subsequently dried by sublimation of the ice under reduced pressure. Typically, the freeze dried foods might contain moisture as low as 1 to 3%.

            There are two basic steps in the freeze drying process (i) Freezing of the product and (ii) Drying of the frozen mass by sublimation process.

            The freeze dyers /freeze drying systems may be classified as pilot or laboratory scale and industrial or large scale freeze dryer. The industrial or large scale freeze dryers may be of multi batch type, continuous freeze dryer or tunnel freeze dryers. The continuous freeze dryers are again classified into two groups, continuous tray freeze dryer or continuous tray-less freeze dryer.

            Tunnel freeze dryer are similar to the continuous tray freeze dryer. The frozen food products are loaded in the trolleys which are passed through the vacuum chambers. The chamber is provided with entry gate and exit gate valves, forward vacuum locks, condenser, etc.

            Lesson Summary
            In aseptic processing, the design to achieve commercial stability is based on the well-founded principles of thermal bacteriology and integrated effect of time/temperature treatment on spores of microorganisms.
            Pre-sterilization of a product usually consists of heating the product to the desired UHT temperature, maintaining this temperature for a given period in order to achieve the desired degree of sterility, with subsequent cooling, usually to ambient temperature and sometimes to an elevated temperature to achieve right viscosity for filling.

            Heating and cooling should be performed as rapidly as possible to achieve the best quality, depending upon the nature of the product.

            Hurdle technology is the combined use of several preservation methods to make a product shelf-stable, to improve its quality and to provide additional safety to the product. It is also known as “combined method technology”. The spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms are not able to jump over the individual factors, which are applied to the food i.e. the combined factors are generally called hurdles.

            Food antimicrobials are chemicals, which are added to or are present in food that retard microbial growth or kill microorganisms. Functions of food antimicrobials are to inhibit or inactivate spoilage microorganisms or pathogens. A number of compounds have been approved by international regulatory agencies.

            Lesson Summary
            For the extraction of oil from the oil seeds two operations are used. One is the mechanical expression, and another is the solvent extraction. In the mechanical process, there are processes which apply heat; there are processes which do not apply much heat. And accordingly the processes are known as cold pressing or hot pressing.

            In the solvent extraction method, organic solvents like hexane, isopropyl alcohol, benzene, etc. or even more safe or green solvents like supercritical carbon dioxide can be used for extraction purposes.
            The extraction of oil from oilseeds by means of non-polar solvents is, basically, a process of solid-liquid extraction.
            The basic principle of the process is the prepared oil seed is brought into intimate contact or direct contact with a suitable non-polar solvent.

            The objectives of the refining process includes the removal of undesirable components from the crude oil like free fatty acids, phospholipids, oxidised products, metal ions, colour pigments and other impurities.
            Components also like chlorophyll which imparts green colour or carotenoids which impart reddish or yellowish colour to the oil.
            It is basically a physical process where the impurities in the oil particularly those pigments and other related components are removed with the help of an adsorbent. The impurities and the active sites of the adsorbents are attracted to each other by Van der Waal force of attraction. The amount of attraction accordingly will influence the
            bleaching efficiency.

            Lesson Summary
            Rancidity is the natural process of decomposition of fats or oils leading to the development of undesirable flavor and odour which is either by hydrolysis or by oxidation. In rancidity by hydrolysis or oxidation, the lipids or fats and
            oils degrade to the point of becoming either unpalatable or unhealthy to ingest.

            Different causative factors for the rancidity include heat, light, radiation, water, enzymes, even catalysts like metal ions, acids, alkali, salt, etc. These are the conditions or agents to which the foods containing fats and oils or even the individual fats and oils come in direct contact during various operations like heating, frying.

            The antioxidants are substances which inhibit or delay the oxidation of a substrate when present at concentrations lower than the oxidising substrate. They are used to counteract the deterioration of stored food products; they function by interfering with the free radical chain reactions and reduce the primary radicals to non-radical species.

            Food antioxidants are classified into two major types. They include primary antioxidants or secondary antioxidants. The primary antioxidants are generally phenols, hindered phenols or other miscellaneous compounds. The secondary or synergistic antioxidants include those which are oxygen scavengers, metal chelators and other miscellaneous compounds.

            Microencapsulation is a process by which very tiny droplet or particles of liquid or solid materials are surrounded or coated with a continuous film of polymeric material. The particles having diameter between 3-800 μ are known as micro particles or microcapsules or microspheres.

            Lesson Summary
            The major processes controlling the fruits and vegetable their shelf life include the respiration and ripening. 
            Respiration is a metabolic process that provides the energy for plant biochemical processes. Various substrates used in important metabolic pathways in the plant are formed during respiration. Aerobic respiration consists of oxidative breakdown of organic reserves to simpler molecules, including CO2 and water, with release of energy.

            The respiration rate is the rate at which the respiration process is taking place that will influence both the ripening process as well as the shelf life of the fruit or the changes which take place in the fruits and vegetables.

            Ripening is a phase in maturation process of fruits and vegetables. As the fruits mature, their tissue undergoes innumerable changes ranging from texture, color, aroma, composition and/or nutritional changes. The terms ripening and maturity are sometimes used alternatively and are regarded as the state when the fresh produce becomes appropriately suitable for harvesting as well as for eating.

            Modified atmosphere packaging involves the modification of the headspace gases in a package in order to prolong the shelf life of the product. Modified atmosphere packaging is a technique used to lengthen the shelf-life of processed food products or fresh produce. The packaging allows a control permeation of gases i.e. carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapor. And using a packaging material of suitable characteristics, the modified atmosphere packages are formed.

            Lesson Summary
            Food grain production in India grew at an average 2% in the last 2 decades, which is higher than the average rate of population growth of 1.5% in the country. Total food grain production in India during 2017-18 was estimated to be 277.49 million tonnes.
            There is a need to take appropriate measures to reduce grain losses. To achieve this goal, proper storage conditions should be maintained to minimize the losses. The various factors operating in the total value chain of the grains i.e. starting from harvesting, to the processing and packaging may cause losses.

            In stored grain ecosystem, various conditions prevail which include the ambient conditions, conditions inside the storage atmosphere and conditions of the grain.

            There are different types of grain storage structures in India; storage structures which are used traditionally as well as scientific storage structure. The grains are generally stored either in bags or in bulk. The major types of structures for storage of grains, include traditional storage structures, improved storage structures, modern storage structures and farm silos.

            Different ways by which grains can be disinfested like physical methods, chemical methods as well as biological methods. The physical methods generally are costlier process, biological methods are not very useful for bulk storage of grains, they can be done for small quantity grains.

            Lesson Summary
            Fortification is the increase of a level of particular nutrient or group of nutrients, particularly micro nutrients in food material to tackle some nutrition related issues.

            Fortification is often more cost-effective than other strategies for improving the nutrients content in food.
            The fortified foods should be commonly consumed by the target population and linked to energy intake. Fortified food should have a constant consumption pattern with low risk of excess consumption.
            Bio-fortification is the process of increasing the density of vitamins and minerals in a crop through conventional plant breeding, or using transgenic techniques, or agronomic practices.

            Malnutrition is a major concern for young children and women nowadays and particularly the micronutrient malnutrition. The micronutrients malnutrition is because of the deficiency of various micronutrients, like minerals and vitamins. About more than 30% or over 2 billion of the world’s population is anaemic, mainly due to iron deficiency anaemia, according to WHO report.
            There are different means of rice fortification using different forms of micronutrients. Different iron fortificants are the compounds of iron which have the potential to be used as fortificant include iron pyrophosphate, ferrous sulphate, iron-ethylene-diamine tetra acetic acid sodium salt or ferrous fumigate or elemental iron.

            Lesson Summary
            The concept about food in earlier days was that the food was being taken as a source of energy and nutrients and the focus was on balanced diet. Nowadays, the food is expected to provide health benefits. The food is taken with an aim to have a weight control in the body, the food is thought to have no chemical additives, it should be fresh and be minimally processed.
            Algae is defined as a heterogeneous assemblage of organisms that range in size from tiny cells to giant seaweeds. Algae mostly are photosynthetic species which include eukaryotes and prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, blue green algae and they live in aquatic habitats.

            The green algae which is called as chlorophyta, has unicellular and colonial flagellates and the phaeophyta or brown algae is branched and have filamentous thallus.

            Dulse is a red species of algae which is sold particularly in Ireland and Atlantic Canada. Chlorella, it is a popular microalgae which has similar nutritional values that of Spirulina and Dulse.

            Gluten free products have gained popularity in American markets, European markets and also in India. The gluten is a protein found in cereals like wheat, rye, triticale and barley. It has two protein strands called glutenin and gliadin.

            The characteristic protein of wheat makes a wheat an ideal ingredient for preparation of bakery products like bread, pasta, biscuits, etc.

                Material Notes:
                Basic Laws of Thermodynamics
                The First Law of Thermodynamics is the conservation of energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be changed from one form into another.
                    A gas power station takes the energy in the gas and converts it to electricity and heat
                    A car engine converts fuel to kinetic energy
                    The sun converts matter to energy through nuclear fusion
                    A light bulb converts electrical energy to electromagnetic radiation (light) and heat
                The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat will always move from a warmer body to a colder body.
                S.I. Units Used for Energy Measurement
                Mankind has throughout history developed countless ways to measure length, weight, temperature, time, energy, pressure, strength, and so on. France developed the Système International d'unites, (S.I. Units) to form one set of co-dependent measurements which is now the accepted worldwide standard for science and engineering.
                Length	Metre (m)
                Mass	Kilogram (kg)
                Time	Second (sec)
                Temperature	Degrees Kelvin (K)
                Electric Current	Ampere (A)
                Amount of Substance	Mole (mol)
                Luminous Intensity	Candela (cd)
                Of critical importance to note is that all other measurements are derived from these seven S.I. units. The basis for all scientific and engineering calculations is using S.I. units. For example, you should not use centimetres or kilometres for complex calculations involving length.

                Types of Energy
                Kinetic Energy
                Kinetic Example
                Potential Energy
                Potential Example
                Kinetic: The energy of a body due to its motion
                Potential: The energy of a body due to its state (water at the top of a hydroelectric dam)
                Chemical: The energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance

                Thermal: The energy contained as heat in a body or substance
                Nuclear: The energy contained in the mass of matter, which can be released through nuclear fusion or nuclear fission

            Other Forms of Energy

            Chemical Example
            Thermal
            Energy
            Thermal Example
            The energy contained by a substance due to its chemical bonds, that can be released through a chemical reaction
            In practice, the chemical reaction is normally reacting the substance with oxygen, which is burning or combustion.
            The chemical energy content of a substance is called its Calorific Value or C.V.
            Alternatively, Calorific value can also be stated in kilowatt hours (kWh), a derived S.I. unit
            Temperature
            The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object, especially as expressed according to a comparative scale and shown by a thermometer or perceived by touch. Various scales have been developed. The most common are Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin S.I. Unit for temperature is Kelvin:
            One degree Celsius is the same “size” as one Kelvin.
            0 Kelvin = Absolute Zero = -273.15oC


            Did you know? When stating temperature in Kelvin we don’t use the term “degrees”.
            The Celsius scale was derived before Kelvin, they have been designed so that 1OC change is numerically the same as a change of 1K. Celsius and Kelvin are always 273.15 degrees apart.


            0oC is the freezing point of water = 273.15 K
            100OC is the boiling point of water = 373.15 K
            As temperature scales of Kelvin and Celsius are relative, many S.I. calculations can be done with Celsius when the temperature difference is all that matters.
            Energy and Power Basics
            Energy Terms
            The Basic Joule
            Flow of Energy
            Joules (J): The S.I. unit for energy
            Megajoules (MJ): One million joules is an S.I. derived unit
            Kilowatt-hours (kWh): Standard “unit” of electricity = 3.6MJ – is an S.I. derived unit

            The following is a list of other energy terms you might come across. It is good to know what they are, but it is far more important to understand the S.I. units:
            - Tonnes of oil equivalent: Energy contained in 1 tonne of crude oil = 41,839 MJ
            - Tonnes of TNT: Unit used to measure explosive power
            - British Thermal Units (BTU): Old imperial measurement
            Converting Joules and Watts
            Conversion Formulas
            The basic unit of electricity is the kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watts of energy flow for one hour.
            Remember 1 joule = 1 watt per second
            1 kWh = 1000 watts * 3600 (seconds in an hour) = 3,600,000 Joules (3.6 MJ)
            Practical Energy Calculations
            Remember that energy is neither created nor destroyed, but can be changed from one form into another. Therefore the total energy in a system at the start equals the total energy in the system at the end. Energy calculations centre around determining how much energy is used per unit time, what the energy is being converted into.
            There are no true energy “losses”. For example, a power station releasing heat may be said to be “losing” energy as heat because it is not all being converted to electricity, but it is still a form of energy as heat – it is not truly “lost”.
            This example power station converts 60% of the fuel energy into electricity. As electricity is the desired output the plant is said to be 60% efficient. 

            20% of the remaining energy goes out the chimney (flue) as heat. 20% of the remaining energy is dispersed through the cooling tower.

            How could be plant be more efficient? If you could capture the “waste” heat and put it to use the plant, it would be more efficient.
            Example Calculations
            Example Calculation #1
            Example Calculation #2
            “e” and “th” Denotations
            Example Calculation #3
            A power station burns 15 tonnes of oil per hour, it converts 42% of the energy to electricity, the rest of the energy is released to the atmosphere as heat. 
            If the calorific value of the oil is 38 MJ/kg how much electricity does the power station produce in MW?
            Energy in = 15 * 1,000 * 38 = 570,000 MJ
            Conversion to Electricity = 570,000 * 42% = 239,400 MJ = 239.4 GJ
            Conversion to MWh = 239.4 / 3.6 = 66.5 MWh
            The plant produces 66.5 MWh per hour, cancelling out the hour terms = 66.5 MW

            Conversion Chart
            - Calorie: Based on S.I. units, a Calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise 1kg water by 1K (1OC)
            Specific Heat Capacity
            Every substance varies in how its temperature changes when heat is applied as they have a different Specific Heat Capacity (cp). If we add the same amount of energy to a kg of water and a kg of metal, they will raise in temperature by different amounts. We can measure the Specific Heat Capacity and use this in our calculations.
            Knowing how much heat is needed to change the temperature of a particular substance is very important in thermodynamics. Specific Heat Capacity (cp) is defined by three measurements energy in, mass, and the change in temperature (delta Kelvin). The cp of a material is defined as J.kg-1. ΔK-1cp (Joules/kg/delta Kelvin)

            Water has a cp of 4184 J/kg/ΔK, that means it takes 4184 Joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 Kelvin. Water has one of the highest cp values and is a very useful substance to carry heat, that is why water is used in most heating systems. Below you can find the cp value of some other well known materials.
            eat Capacity Example
            A boiler is rated at 15kW, if the boiler is used to heat 300 litres of water which starts 20OC. What temperature will the water be in half an hour?
            We assume the density of water to be 1 kg/litre
            Energy produced = 15kW for ½ hour = 7.5kWh
            7.5 kWh * 3.6 = 27 MJ = 27,000,000 J
            Cp = J/kg/ΔK
            ΔK = J/kg/cp
            ΔK = 27,000,000/300/4184
            ΔK = 21.51
            ΔOC = ΔK
            If the water started off at 20OC then add the 21.51. Final Temperature = 41.51O
            Specific Heat Capacity
            Thermal Conductivity
            K Value
            Insulators and Conductors
            Specific Heat Example
            Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to move heat, commonly called the k value.
            - Sometimes it's desirable to have a material to move heat fast e.g. from hot water in a radiator to the room, so using a material with a high ability to move heat like metal makes sense.- Sometimes it's desirable to have a material that resists the movement of heat, for example, insulation wrapped around a building to keep the heat in.
            The amount of heat that moves depends on three factors:
            (1) The materials ability to move heat(2) The difference in temperature from the hot side to the cold side of the material
            (3) The thickness of the material
            The K value is determined in S.I. units as follows:
            K = J/m2/m/ΔK/s = joules of energy flowing / area / thickness of material / temperature difference / secondNote that Joules per second is within the equation, therefore the k value is a value in watts
            Materials with high thermal conductivity are called conductors, materials with low thermal conductivity are called insulators.
            K Value, R Value and U Value
            Conductivity of Materials
            Total Heat Transfer
            U Value Example
            Example Formula
            Example Solution
             The k value is the general conductivity of a material measured in J/m2/m/ΔK/s.
            R value is the conductivity of a specific piece of a material i.e of a particular thickness, for example, if we have a piece of cotton insulation that is 0.1m thick we can calculate its R value.
            R value = k value / thickness
            R value = 0.03 / 0.1
            R value = 0.3 (J/m2/m/ΔK/s)
            In other words, a piece of cotton insulation 0.1m thick will transfer 0.3 Joules of heat from one side to the other for every 1 Kelvin in temperature difference. If we calculate for a 0.12m thick concrete wall with a k value of 1.5 J/m2/m/ΔK/s
            R value = 1.5 / 0.12 = 125
            We can see that the concrete wall allows far more heat through than the insulation
            Efficiency and Coefficient of Performance
            The term “efficiency” in energy is generally used to describe what percentage of input energy is transferred into the useful form of energy desired. Examples would include:

                Power station taking in 1000 kWh of gas and producing 550 kWh of electricity = 55% efficient
                Biomass boiler taking in 1000 kWh of woodchip and producing 880 kWh of heat = 88% efficient
                Car engine taking in 10 kWh of diesel and producing 3 kWh of kinetic energy = 30% efficient

            Coefficient of Performance (COP) is a term generally used to describe the efficiency of heat pumps. Heat pumps use electricity to extract heat energy from one place, and move that heat to a higher temperature place, elevating the temperature to deliver useful heat, or reducing the temperature to deliver useful chilling. Heat pumps are able to move more heat than was in the original electrical energy. In electrical efficiency terms they are more than 100% efficient. The term used is COP, with input electricity being 1.
            Heat pumps can move 2-5 times more heat than the energy in the electricity used to power them. The COP would be determined as 2 or 5 in these situations. Examples include:

                Fridge using 0.4 kWh electricity to remove 1.6 kWh of heat from food COP = 4.0
                Heat pump using 10 kWh electricity to deliver 34 kWh of heat to a building COP = 3.4

                Lesson Summary
                The key contents covered in this module are:
                    The system of symmetrical components is used to represent an unbalanced set of phasors by three decoupled or independent sets of balanced phasors.
                    A set of asymmetrical vectors (voltage or current) can be converted to the sum of their balanced 3 phase components called the positive, negative and zero sequences.
                    The ‘a’ operator shifts the phasors or vectors by 120 degrees.
                    As the positive and negative phases are 1200 apart and the zero sequences are in phase, each phase of the asymmetrical components can be represented in terms of the phase with the ‘a’ operator.
                    a=1∠120∘,a2=1∠−120∘or1∠240∘ora(a);a−1=a2,a−2=a
                    a3=1∠360∘=1,soa3−1=0
                    The b-phase positive sequence in terms of a-phase sequence shifted by the ‘a’ operator is represented as Vb1=a2Va1, while the c-phase positive sequence Vc1= aVa1.
                    The b-phase negative sequence in terms of a-phase sequence shifted by the ‘a’ operator is represented as Vb2=aVa2, while the c-phase negative sequence Vc2= a2Va2.
                    As the zero sequences are in phase, Va0=Vb0=Vc0

                        Sustainable energy offers us the opportunity to create a society that will survive the long-term rigours of global climate change and move away from fossil fuels.
                        Solar collectors are things that absorb sunlight and create heat, much like a greenhouse.
                        Photovoltaic systems are composed of a cell, a module and a network, and convert light directly into electricity.The photovoltaic effect is the conversion of photons into electricity.
                        Photovoltaic cells work to harness the photovoltaic effect by allowing photons to excite electrons in a semiconductor.
                        The wind is essentially air in motion, and occurs as a result of the conversion of potential energy in the atmosphere into kinetic energy, with the source of energy being the sun.
                        Wind turbines are split into two categories: residential and wind farms.The amount of electricity produced by a wind turbine relies on three key factors: wind speed, wind turbine availability, and turbine arrangement.
                        Biogas can be made from anything organic that is a mixture of gasses. Harvesting biogas requires plants to be set up to collect the harvest.
                        Biofuels are liquid fuels derived from plant material (feedstock). Biofuels are generally separated into four "generations".
                        Biofuels and biogases are sustainable forms of energy that can be harnessed to fill the gap when non-sustainable fossil fuels are depleted.

                        Lesson Summary
                            Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is the nature of air quality inside a building that affects the health and well being of its occupants.
                            The feeling of illness among the majority of the occupants of a conditioned space is called the "Sick Building Syndrome."
                            The sources of pollutants in the indoor environment could be volatile organic chemicals, respirable particulates and bioaerosols.
                            Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is a major source of indoor air contamination.
                            The contaminants can be managed by design that may involve natural and mechanical ventilation and a suitable IAQ management plan.
                            Natural ventilation involves infiltration and exfiltration of air.
                            Examples of mechanical ventilators are fans, blowers and HVAC system.
                            Low emission materials are prescribed by different standards for indoor chemical and pollution source control.
                            The thermal, visual and acoustic comfort levels within the building should be controllable by occupants.
                            Interior design considerations, such as circulation spaces, indoor plants and ergonomic furniture enhance the health and well-being of the occupants of a building.

                        Lesson Summary
                        You have learnt the following in this module:
                            A supervisor is a person who oversees and manages the work of other people. Supervisors typically have more experience and seniority than the people they are supervising.
                            Supervision is the process of monitoring and guiding the work of other people.
                            The goal of supervision is to ensure that work is done correctly and efficiently and that employees are performing their duties to the best of their abilities.
                            Supervisors and leaders both need to be able to build relationships, inspire trust, and earn respect.
                            Leaders typically focus on inspiring and motivating their team, while supervisors tend to focus more on managing tasks and ensuring compliance with policies and procedures.
                            Communication is the process of exchanging information between two or more people. It can be verbal, written, or nonverbal, and it can be done face-to-face, over the phone, or through technology such as email or social media.
                            Active listening is a communication technique that involves fully focusing on and engaging with the person who is speaking.
                            By creating a positive and productive team environment, leaders can help their team to be more effective and to achieve their goals.

                    Lesson Summary
                    The key points covered in this module are:
                        During the first six years of life, children develop rapidly. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors gained in this period become the foundations of children's future lives.
                        The six principles that should be taken in mathematics education are equality, training program, teaching, learning, assessment, and technology.
                        Early mathematics skills in preschool education are divided into numerical relations, counting skills, and arithmetic operations.
                        Children's understanding of numerical changes, the decrease and increase of objects, and the ability to create new quantities are also necessary prerequisites for arithmetic operations.
                        Individuals acquire mathematical thinking and intuition without being aware of it from the moment of their birth.
                        Mathematical concepts extend the interrelated connections between symbols, concrete situations, pictures, and language.
                        Counting principles have five stages: the Cardinal Principle, the One-to-One Matching Principle, the Principle of Fixe Early Education: The Role of Technology d Order, the Principle of Abstraction, the Principle of Irrelevance of Order

                            The internet has opened new ways for people to connect with their friends and families, revealing how it plays a central role in young people's friendships.
                            According to psychologists, there are five stages of friendship development: Momentary physical interaction, one-way assistance, two-way/by the rules, intimate/mutually shared friendships, and mature friendships.
                            The most popular tools that 8-17-year-olds use to chat with friends daily are youtube, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook or Messenger.
                            68% of young people said chatting with friends online cheers them up. 
                            A study measured friendship in six domains: Validation and caring, conflict and betrayal, companionship and recreation, help and guidance, intimate exchange, and conflict resolution.

                                A child can benefit most from screen time when parents and children watch and play together on a device.
                                It is essential to manage screentime through plans, rules, and limits. Encourage meaningful screen use so that time spent online serves a purpose. 
                                Children below the age of two should be restricted from using a phone. Children between two to five can start using phones as entertainment platforms. Ages twelve and above can be appropriate for phone usage.
                                Starting with devices with limited uses can act as training wheels so kids can be provided with something in the future based on good phone behavior.
                                Microwave radiation from smartphones and other devices can have very harmful effects on children. Other physical and psychological problems can also occur due to excessive smartphone use.
                                Life360 encourages families to create a circle on the app so that everyone knows where everyone else is at all times.
                                Cellphones at school can be used to stay in touch with family at all times, manage anxieties and offer learning opportunities.
                                However, cellphones can also act as a tool for cyberbullying and can have negative side effects on mental health.

                        Lesson Summary
                        The key points from this module are:
                            Start positively by telling trainees what they should do not what they should not do.

                            The number one thing you can do to really help is to do a practice video interview even if it is with your phone.
                            Get the client to review the video.

                            The number one thing you should not do is to talk and advice.

                            Giving people advice on what to say and what not to say in an interview is completely worthless. They may think you smart but then it does not translate into action.

                            Focus on doing rehearsals and getting clients to tell you what they like and don't like.

                            The second biggest flaw is wasting time brainstorming on questions and answers without organizing possible message points.

                            The person preparing for the interview is not helped to process and prioritize messages.
                             Everything is processed in context in this case while in real life, everything may be quoted out of context.
                            If you know a reporter can isolate one idea, you need to help the person preparing for the interview isolate one idea at a time.
                            Learning Outcomes
                            Upon successful completion of this module you will be able to:
                                Discuss the basic principles of answering questions in interviews
                                Explain how to get the client to the point where they are answering questions strategically.
                                Describe how the client can be focused on hitting the messages in every answer without sounding like a robot.
                                Summarize how to work with your clients to come up with sound bites before the interview.

                                The key points from this module are:
                                    Give the person you are working with, basic principles of how to answer questions in interviews.

                                    There is a tendency for people to want to be too literal.

                                    Don't spend 30 minutes doing a lengthy interview because the things people do well or poorly, they will do in a couple of minutes.

                                    Conduct the interview, ask questions with the goal of hitting all 3 messages in every answer.

                                    Of all the principles it is the hardest to achieve. The natural reaction is to just answer the question but if you only answer questions you will never hit your messages and you will never accomplish your goal.

                                    The client should get to the point where they are answering questions strategically focused and hitting all the messages in every answer without sounding like a robot.

                                    Most people don't know why they were quoted, erroneously believing it is simply random luck or the bias of the reporter. They have no sense that it is actually the sentence structure of how they put their ideas out.

                                    You have to work with your clients to come up with sound bites. First, check out what they can do on their own. Some are good at it while others suck with no correlation to IQ or intelligence, it is just how their brain works.

                                    Explain the process of assessing the effectiveness of training
                                    Indicate how to create a Training Needs Analysis for your company
                                    Define the steps to do an activity plan and prepare the training material

                                        Paul Kern's three-box system is practical for efficiently categorising where to focus on, like 'added value training' for example.
                                        You may decide to establish a culture of continuous improvement. Begin measuring its effects by examining how much time gets spent on training and the impacts on the company's bottom line or the lives of its employees.
                                        Recall the difference in training between what we need and what we are doing is equivalent to the gap in our skills and expertise.
                                        To align training programs with the Training Needs Analysis (TNA), you must identify specific training interventions for the people involved in delivering the project.

                            Maria Montessori
                            Maria Montessori
                            In an era of information overload and screen-based experiences, Montessori education goes beyond data accumulation to focus on understanding children and adolescents as learners. It emphasizes their cognitive development, sensory experiences, and developing developmental traits.

                            Montessori education creates environments that align with natural developmental stages, enabling children and adolescents to engage in meaningful work, explore freely, and reflect deeply, fostering a lifelong love of learning.
                            In this method, knowledge is discovered rather than taught, with children exploring and understanding the world through curiosity and interest. Montessori education prioritizes creating learning environments that align with natural developmental stages, allowing children and adolescents to engage in meaningful work, explore freely, and reflect deeply, fostering a lifelong love of learning.

                            This exceptional educational approach was established in 1907 by Maria Montessori, an innovative Italian anthropologist and physician. It was grounded in her practical experiences and observations of children in San Lorenzo, a poverty-stricken area of Rome. Over the past 110 years, educators, researchers, and scientists have refined the Montessori method, which is now practiced across six continents. Nearly 5,000 private and public Montessori schools have adopted this approach in North America alone.

                        Pedagogy in Montessori Education
                        The core of Montessori pedagogy is the belief that every child is born with the inherent potential for success. The adult's role is to create an environment that supports the child's natural desire to learn and develop skills.
                        Here, we outline the pedagogy with three main principles:
                        "HELP ME TO DO IT MYSELF" - MARIA MONTESSORI.
                        Active Learning: The Child Is the Driver of Their Education

                        Montessori pedagogy promotes active learning by empowering the child to build knowledge in a well-prepared environment with adult guidance.
                        With natural self-discipline, the child is free to select their activities, making them more receptive and better able to assimilate new information. The child progresses with the educator’s support, who, after introducing the material and its use, adopts a minimally intrusive role to allow the child to learn through their own experiences.

                        Learning by Doing: Specialized Equipment in a Conducive Environment
                        Four Key Learning Domains
                        Pedagogy refers to a teaching approach that usually includes a theory of learning and a strategy for applying that philosophy in lesson planning.
                        Teachers are key in Montessori education in providing “freedom within limits.” They offer personalized lessons, select learning materials, and create plans to support each student’s growth, ensuring active engagement without traditional lectures. Every Montessori school tailors its curriculum to the individual needs of its students. However, across all grade levels, lessons fall into four key categories:
                        Math and Science
                        Language and Reading
                        Sensorial
                        Practical Life
                        Montessori students learn basic math early, and their skills are reinforced throughout their education. From using counting beads to solving more complex problems, Montessori students often achieve advanced math proficiency by the time they reach elementary school.

                        Key Principles of Montessori Pedagogy
                        Early educational methods significantly impact a child's learning success. Maria Montessori's method, effective in both elementary and higher education, emphasizes natural, spontaneous learning. It fosters emotional stability and independence and enhances self-confidence and concentration through a supportive environment, creative encouragement, and guided teaching.

                        Higher education promotes curiosity, experimentation, and personalized support, reducing stress. Montessori pedagogy, focused on the child's innate curiosity, supports independent learning through sensory, practical, and language activities, developing cognitive and motor skills. Grounded in strong philosophical and scientific principles, the Montessori method encompasses several key educational principles:
                        Focus on Individual Needs
                        Each child is recognized as an individual with unique needs, similar to an adult. The child plays a central role in their development.

                        Adjusting Activities
                        Emphasis on Sensory Experience
                        Materials and equipment should align with the child’s pace and needs, facilitating better understanding and engagement. Tailored activities help maintain motivation and encourage learning.
                        Montessori pedagogy fosters emotional stability and tranquillity by providing a secure environment. The calm and orderly setting reduces stress and creates a soothing atmosphere. This approach also highlights autonomy, which fosters responsibility and builds self-confidence. Additionally, it enhances concentration through engaging and stimulating activities.
                        The Concept of Pedagogy in Education
                        As defined by Merriam-Webster, Pedagogy is the “art, science, or profession of teaching,” and involves various elements such as teaching methods, feedback, and assessment. In essence, pedagogy is the study of different teaching strategies.
                        While each educator may have their approach to teaching, they must also consider how to best deliver content and evaluate student learning based on individual needs.
                            Do students require more lectures or time for independent work?
                            What teaching methods are most effective for these students?
                        These are key pedagogical questions for improving student learning outcomes.
                        ching Methods
                        Teaching pedagogy, or methods of instruction, can be either teacher-centered or student-centered and may involve low-tech or high-tech tools. Teacher-centered learning emphasizes direct instruction, where the teacher lectures and imparts knowledge to students. Assessments in this model measure how well students retain and recall the information presented.
                        Student-Centered Learning
                        Low-Tech vs. High-Tech Approaches
                        In contrast, student-centered learning encourages active participation from students. Here, the teacher acts more as a coach or mentor, supporting students as they engage with the material. Assessments, such as formative evaluations, are given more frequently to monitor progress and tend to be more objective.
                        Conversely, a high-tech, student-centered approach might involve an interactive LMS lesson on trigonometry that adapts to the student's knowledge and provides an engaging learning experience. Each pedagogical method has its benefits and limitations, and combining different approaches can effectively address diverse student needs.
                        Pedagogical Approaches
                        We will discuss the pedagogical approaches to teachin

                Learning Pedagogy and Multiple Intelligences
                Understanding learning pedagogy is crucial for addressing how students comprehend information and is as important as teaching pedagogy in supporting individual learning needs. Teachers recognize that each student is unique, so identifying how they learn best can help tailor instruction to their needs.
                Several theories, including Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, explore how students learn. Gardner’s research examines different learning styles and identifies strengths and challenges for various types of learners. According to this theory, learning can be categorized into three broad types—visual, auditory, and tactile—with nine specific intelligences:
                Spatial-Visual Intelligence
                Learning Pedagogy and Multiple Intelligences - Page B
                In 1987, Neil Fleming introduced the VARK theory, which identifies four learning styles: Visual, Aural (or Auditory), Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic (or Tactile). Like Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, this model provides a framework for understanding and supporting different learning preferences.
                Intrapersonal Intelligence
                Logical-Mathematical Intelligence
                Musical Intelligence
                Bodily Kinesthetic Intelligence
                Existential Intelligence
                Teaching and Learning Pedagogical Approaches
                There are five main pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning, each with its own unique focus. Often, a blend of these approaches is most effective:
                Constructivist
                Collaborative
                Inquiry-Based
                Integrative
                Reflective
                Learning Environment in Montessori Education
                Dr. Maria Montessori emphasized the importance of the learning environment, referring to the teacher as the 'Director.' She believed that experiences and a positive physical environment are crucial in fostering self-education. Montessori's approach to pedagogy is intentional. It empowers children toward holistic and purposeful development, ensuring they stay connected to their surroundings.
                In Montessori education, children engage in learning experiences through carefully selected materials designed to guide them from what they know to what they have yet to learn—progressing from the concrete to the abstract.

                Practical Life Activities
                Practical life activities, adaptable to all ages, aim to build self-sufficiency. These simple to complex tasks carry dignity independently, teaching children to follow sequences and meet their needs. Early introduction fosters self-discipline, confidence, and independence, which are essential for lifelong success.
                The Montessori Curriculum

                The first three years of a child's existence provide the groundwork for future growth. The kid is in what Montessori refers to as a "spiritual embryo" and, at this time, does what the embryo did in the physical realm, but in the psychological realm. Events in life mold the brain, creating neural networks or connections that may remain throughout the person's lifetime. From birth to three years old, Montessori education focuses on developing language, coordinated movement, and independence, which gives the child confidence.
                There are four main curricular areas for kids in grades three through six regions of operation:
                Practical Life
                Sensorial
                Language
                Mathematics
                Fostering the Development of Five Key Motor Skills
                In a Montessori preschool, promoting the development of five key motor skills—fine motor, gross motor, hand-eye coordination, balance, and spatial awareness—is essential to fostering children's physical growth and independence through purposeful, hands-on activities.
                Development of Childhood
                Five Key Motor Skills
                The activities support children's physical development in a hands-on, engaging way that aligns with Montessori principles.
                Development of Sensation
                Mass Physical Development
                One of the primary goals of the curriculum in a Montessori preschool is to help the child develop their senses—visual, tactile, thermogenic, auditory, baric, stereognosis, olfactory, and gustatory. The idea is for the youngster to develop a sense of order by using her senses to categorize her surroundings intentionally and explicitly.
                A Montessori preschool, as opposed to a regular preschool, emphasizes the development of the complete child. This encompasses the physical growth of a kid. All preschoolers who follow the Montessori method will leave with the information and abilities needed to develop a sense of autonomy and organization. These abilities include improved gross and fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and sensory development.
                Fine Motor Abilities and Hand-Eye Coordination


                Fine Motor Skills

                These pursuits should care for the individual, others, and their physical surroundings. The youngster is likely familiar with some tasks: mopping, polishing, setting the table, arranging flowers, etc. They also contain "grace and courtesy" actions, characteristics of all civilized individuals.

                Through these and other activities, children learn control, coordination of movement, and exploration of their environment. Children gain the ability to finish a task from start to finish and the will, self-control, focus, and self-assurance.

                Lesson Summary
                The following are the important points covered in this module:

                    Montessori pedagogy promotes active learning by empowering the child to build knowledge in a well-prepared environment with adult guidance.
                    With natural self-discipline,
                    Montessori pedagogy, focused on the child's innate curiosity, supports independent learning through sensory, practical, and language activities, developing cognitive and motor skills. 
                    Student-centered learning encourages active participation from students. Here, the teacher acts more like a coach or mentor, supporting students as they engage with the material. Assessments, such as formative evaluations, are given more frequently to monitor progress.
                    According to Gardner's theory, learning can be categorized into three broad types—visual, auditory, and tactile—with nine specific intelligences.
                    After a teacher-led lesson, students can assess their understanding by working with a peer. This can be useful for students who feel more at ease practising new skills with classmates rather than alone or with the teacher, allowing them to review before attempting homework or assessments independently.
                    One of the primary goals of the curriculum in a Montessori preschool is to help the child develop their senses—visual, tactile, thermogenic, auditory, baric, stereognosis, olfactory, and gustatory.

                        Recognize how to diagnose students with dyslexia. 
                        Lesson Summary
                        The key contents covered in this module are: 
                            One can define pedagogy as 'any conscious activity by one person designed to enhance learning in another.
                            The three pedagogical terms most commonly used in the studies to describe or promote specific approaches were learner- or student-centered, child-centered and activity-based learning.

                             In pedagogy, there is a pressing need for educators to be able to bring to light the reactions, responses, decisions, and movements that influence and form their teaching while teaching.
                             When it comes to teaching, a teacher must maintain a delicate balance between what is being taught (subject matter) and how it is being taught (instruction).
                            Critical pedagogy is a teaching philosophy that invites educators to encourage students to critique structures of power and oppression.

                            Teachers' pedagogic approaches, strategies and practices thus serve to enact the curriculum.
                            Experienced teachers routinize much of their practice, making it habitual and automatic, built on tacit, situated knowledge.

                Having completed this module you will be able to:

                    Describe how to work with functions to plot graphs, including quadratic, cubic and exponential graphs.
                    Recognise basic differentiation of functions.
                    State the local maxima and local minima turning points of a curve.
                    Recognise the rate of change in distance.
                    Explain how to use a slope to determine the nature of a function.
                    Identify how to use the trapezoidal rule to find the area.
                    Lesson Summary
                    In this module you have studied the following:
                        When plotting quadratic graphs the path will always be in the shape of a 'U' or sometimes referred to as the shape of a chin.
                        When plotting cubic graphs the path of the line will always be squiggly, or wavy, in shape.
                        When plotting reciprocals the shape will be curved, like a 'C'.
                        You can graph any equation using a table of values. A table of values is a graphic organizer or chart that helps you determine two or more points that can be used to create your graph.
                        In order to graph a line, you must have two points. For any given linear equation, there are an infinite number of solutions or points on that line.
                        Completing the Square is a technique which can be used to find maximum or minimum values of quadratic functions. We can also use this technique to change or simplify the form of algebraic expressions. We can use it for solving quadratic equations.
                        To complete the square, add or subtract the same value to both sides. Factor the expression on the left side of the equation. Calculate the sum or difference on the right side of the equation. Solve the equation.
                        During an assessment, questions pertaining to parabolas will most likely ask you to plot points on both the X & Y axis, the lowest or highest point and the line of symmetry.

                                Electronic Dance Music Characteristics
                                    In the EDM classification, the Future bass genre manages a tempo of 130-160 BPM. Normally a Trap style beat is around 140 beats per minute. This music is often played in nightclubs and festivals due to its strong danceable beat structure.
                                    Synthesizers, drum machines, and other instruments and noises are frequently used in dance music, and the sound has an inherent "electronic feel" to it.
                                    The chord progression can be the foundation for a complete EDM track. The major or minor keys used to create the chord progression become the guidelines for the lead melody.
                                    Transition chords are useful to drive through the chord progressions without abruptly cutting or interrupting the music beat.
                                    Implement the use of reverb (short for Reverberation) to affect the natural space of a sound movement. Arrange the sound's density, balance, natural feedback, echo effects, or change settings to ensure that the track will stand out in front of the audience.

                        Lesson Summary
                        Having completed this module, you have learnt the following:
                            The absolute value of a negative number will always be less than that of a positive number. As an example, -5 is smaller than 3, despite 5 being larger.
                            Fractions of percentages have 100 as their denominator and the numerator as their numerator. In order to write a percentage as a decimal, you should divide the percentage by 100 since fractions are also instructions to divide.

                            The definition of an equivalent ratio is a ratio that has the same value but differs in parts. You can find equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing both parts by the same number.
                            A fundamental part of geometry is understanding shapes. There are different categories of shapes based on their properties, such as the number of sides, angles, and vertices. The most common shapes are triangles, circles, squares, rectangles, and polygons.

                            A practical application of exponents can be found in calculating compound interest, which is a function of exponents. In the case of compound interest, the interest is calculated not only on the principal of the loan but also on the accumulated interest in previous periods.
                            The concept of a multiple can be simplified by saying that it is a number that is the result of a product between two numbers.

                            Upon completion of this course, you will be able to: 
                                Differentiate between vector and scalar values.
                                Discuss Physics Notation. Describe how vectors, such as velocity and acceleration, are derived. 
                                Calculate the unknown values from the known values. 
                                Identify Newton's 3 Laws of Motion.
                                The key points from this module are:
                                A vector is something that has a magnitude - or you can kind of view that as a size - and it has a direction. Displacement is a vector quantity. Velocity is the speed of something in a given direction. Acceleration is the change in velocity over time.
                                A scalar only has a magnitude or size. So if someone were to just say "five meters", this is a scalar quantity.
                                Newton's Three Laws of Motion:
                                    Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. 
                                    The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force. 
                                    The third law states that for every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. Physics - Gravity

                    Lesson Summary

                        Distance is a measurement of “how far”. Distance is a scalar quantity.
                        The displacement is defined as the shortest distance from the starting point to the final point. The total displacement must be determined using the rules defined under the vector addition section.
                        Speed is a measurement of “how fast”. Speed is defined as the distance travelled by an object per unit of time. Speed is a scalar quantity.
                        Velocity is a measurement of “how fast” and in what direction. It is defined as the rate of change of displacement. (Example: 100 km/hour, East.).
                        Speed is the rate of change of distance with time. As a scalar, it has magnitude only. Average speed is measured over a non-zero time interval. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time. As a vector, it must be stated with both magnitude and direction.
                        Acceleration measures how much velocity changes per unit of time. It is a vector quantity. It is a vector quantity. Acceleration can be positive or negative. 
                        A body is said to move with uniform acceleration if its velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time.
                        The ratio of the total change in velocity of the object during the motion to the total time taken is the average acceleration of the body.
                        The speed of an object at a given instant of time is called its instantaneous speed. In the case of uniform motion, the instantaneous speed is equal to the uniform speed CLEP Chemistry: Chemical Reactions and Kinetics

                        Lesson Summary
                            The half-reaction method and ion-electron method are used for balancing redox reactions. 
                            A redox reaction can be broken down into two separate reactions. The oxidation part of the reaction and the reduction part of the reaction.
                            Chemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one substance to another. This type of reaction is called a reduction-oxidation reaction.
                            It is important to keep track of the number of electrons being transferred in a redox reaction.
                            Redox reactions are somewhat unique in that the number of electrons lost during oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained during reduction.
                            The redox reaction is said to be spontaneous if the electron transfer occurs without any input of energy.
                            The spontaneity of a redox reaction is determined by the ability of the substances involved in the reaction to be reduced or oxidized.
                            The two electrodes used in the electrolysis are called: anode and cathode.
                             Voltaic cells or otherwise called galvanic cells use the energy produced from spontaneous reactions that occur at anode and cathode to do electric work.
                            The difference between electrolytic cell and voltaic cell is that in electrolysis, external electric energy is used as the driving force for a reaction (both reduction an

                                Organic compounds are those that are naturally found in living organisms, such as plants and animals. Organic chemistry may be defined as the study of chemical compounds that contain carbon.
                                Hydrocarbons are classified into two main categories: Open chain compounds (acyclic or aliphatic compounds) and closed chain or cyclic chain compounds.
                                A saturated hydrocarbon contains ONLY carbon-carbon single bonds. Saturated hydrocarbons are also commonly called alkanes.
                                Aromatic hydrocarbon contains carbon-carbon bonds that result in a closed ring-like structure.
                                The three main types of isomers are Structural isomers, cis –isomers, trans-isomers.
                                Structural isomers are those compounds that have two or more different structures but the same chemical formula.
                                The general molecular formula for alkenes is CnH2n, alkynes is CnH2 n - 2. 
                                Functional groups are also a convenient way to classify organic compounds. There are many other functional groups in addition to double and triple bonds.
                                The carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes and the carbon-carbon triple bond in alkynes are referred to as the functional group of the compound.

                        Lesson Summary
                            The rate of a chemical reaction is a function of concentration or pressure if gases are involved.
                            The rate of a chemical reaction is a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the reactant particles increase their kinetic energy and move faster. The faster movement results in an increase in the number of successful collisions and hence, the reaction rate.
                             A catalyst is a substance that can alter the reaction rate without being involved in the reaction. A catalyst increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction path that has lower activation energy.
                            Some of the key features of catalysts are: A small amount of catalyst will produce a large amount of chemical change, catalysts are specific to a chemical reaction and catalysts do not affect the equilibrium state of a reaction.
                            The half-life of a reaction is defined as the time required for half of the initial reactant to be consumed.
                            The easiest way to determine the rate law or the order of the reaction is to create three plots which are: Concentration [A] vs. time, the logarithm of concentration [A] vs. time and inverse of concentration [1/A] vs. time.
                            A catalyst does not increase the number of collisions between the reactant particles but only causes more of the collisions to become successful collisions thus, increasing the rate of the

                    What is Sous Vide?
                    Sous vide (pronunciation: sue-veed) is a popular cooking technique that originated in France. Sous vide means under the vacuum and implies the vacuum-sealing of food in a bag. After the food has been sealed, it is cooked at a precise temperature in a water bath. Sous Vide cooking technique is helpful in cooking food to the desired level of doneness. 
                    Why Should Cooking be Done via Sous Vide Method?
                    Traditional cooking methods do not provide chefs with enough temperature control. This often leads to food being overcooked from the outside while remaining almost raw (or undercooked) from the inside. Foods cooked with these methods can become dry and chewy, tasteless, and undesirable for the eaters. 
                    In contrast to these traditional cooking methods, Sous Vide provides chefs and cooks with the required control over their cooking. It comprises precise temperature control and circulation to the cook, leading to numerous benefits. 
                    How is Sous Vide Beneficial?
                    On this page, we will list some of the major benefits associated with sous vide cooking:
                    It Produces Consistent Results
                    It Enhances Taste of the Food
                    It Reduces Food Waste
                    Flexibility
                    Traditional cooking requires constant supervision from the chef, as their are chances of the food getting overcooked. In contrast, precision cooking with Sous Vide allows chefs to bring their foods to exact temperatures and hold it there without worrying about overcooking

                    Common Queries Related to Sous Vide Technique

                        When Should the Meat be Seasoned with Salt: Storing the meat with salt for a long time can alter its texture. If you want to season beef with salt, use salt immediately before or after cooking (and before searing). 
                        Managing Variable Time Ranges: You can cook your meal above 130°F (or 54°C) for longer hours, as it will not pose any significant health risks. However, you must avoid cooking longer than four hours below 130°F temperature. 
                        Addition of Aromatics to Sous Vide Bag: Regarding the addition of aromatics to the Sous Vide bag, you must remember that not everyone will like the concentrated flavors of these spices and herbs. Therefore, you should look for alternatives, such as using garlic powder in place of garlic or adding herbs and aromatics in the pan after searing the meat.

                            The key learning points from this module are;
                                A single muscle fibre is a cylindrical, elongated cell. Muscle cells can be extremely short or long. 
                                Thousands of muscle fibres are wrapped in a thin layer of connective tissue called the perimysium to form a muscle bundle. Groups of muscle bundles that join into a tendon at each end make up a muscle (e.g. biceps muscle).
                                Components of the muscle cells: The cell membrane, Contractile proteins, The cytosol, Mitochondria, and Capillaries .
                                There are three types of muscles in the body: smooth (intestinal wall and arteries), cardiac, skeletal.
                                For contraction to occur, a nerve impulse must be sent from the brain. 
                                The nerve that goes to the muscle is called a MOTOR NEURON. Motor neurons are responsible for stimulating a number of muscle fibres - together they are called a MOTOR UNIT.
                                Muscles work in pairs. The AGONIST is the working muscle. The ANTAGONIST is the relaxing muscle.
                                The heart is situated almost dead centre in the middle of the chest.
                                Heart rate is usually in direct ratio to body size.

                        Lesson Summary
                        The key learning points from this module are;
                            The principles of training; overload, specificity, reversibility, and individual differences. 
                            Training is a cyclical process of tearing down and building up.
                            Even most untrained body has a built-in reserve capacity to handle a substantial degree of stress, there is a minimum threshold for intensity and duration of stress that must be exceeded before additional adaptations are triggered. This is the minimum training threshold.
                            When designing a training program, specificity is an important component. It is important that the training methods are relevant to the important fitness component and that the exercises within the training methods are specific to the sport. 
                            The intensity of each training method is important because it governs the energy system being trained.
                            To achieve continual improvement over time, overload must be incorporated into a training program so that the body is forced to adapt to the new workload.
                            Frequency is the number of training sessions completed each week. In order to achieve a training effect, one must train a minimum of:
                            2 times/week to maintain levels
                            3 times/week to improve levels
                            The minimal length of any training session should be 20
                            Learning Outcomes

                                By the end of this course you will be able to:
                                    Having strong, soft skills protect your career and make you indispensable. Technology skills are not always referred to having vast knowledge on complicated things such as C++ or HTML but knowing how the technology of your industry, office and other social media can make you indispensable.
                                    A method to strengthen a relationship between your boss and you is to execute a positive attitude and willingness to do anything. For example, you receive a good position in a company, but you receive a task way beneath your educational credentials and background. Fulfilling that task can show your competencies and build an excellent reputation.
                                    Emotional intelligence is how you can manage your own emotions and be aware of others emotions. We also vie who EQ beats IQ. It is crucial to cultivate EQ to manage negative emotions because it will affect us in our work life as well as our social life.
                                    Time management is a crucial soft skill for any career. This skill comes to effect when arriving at work early. It is essential to consider potential issues such as traffic, car problems, a full bus, etc.
                                    It is probable that you have heard "dress for success" "Clothes make the man or woman". Although we live in the 21st century, this may come as a cliche, but it still affects how people view us. It is vital to dress appropriately according to the circumstance. For example, you will most certainly not wear a Halloween costume for an important meeting.

                                    The main points from this module are:

                                        Our values and beliefs impact how we relate to, empathise with and engage with others.

                                        Communication and organisational behaviour are significantly influenced by emotions.

                                        Self-awareness is the conscious knowledge of one’s own character and feelings.

                                        Getting feedback from others and reflecting on your own actions can increase your self-awareness.

                                        SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats involved in a project or in a business venture.

                                        Before setting goals for your career, you need to ask yourself questions such as ‘what goals do you have in mind?’, ‘why are you concerned about this?’ and ‘what significance do they have for you’?.
                                        A professional development plan (PDP) is a tool that can be employed to prioritise, assess and concentrate on professional development efforts.

                                        To make the decisions necessary to maintain the efficiency of their organisation, managers and leaders must be able to recognise work priorities.

                        Learning Outcomes
                        On completion of this module, you will be able to:

                            Define the food processing industry, its importance and its different sectors.
                            Recognize what is meant by the term food safety and its importance to the food processing industry.
                            Classify the different food safety hazards that might be present in the food processing industry and foods.
                            Describe the preventive nature of the HACCP food safety system in the food processing industry.
                            Distinguish between the two terms “hazard” and “risk” in the control of food safety. 
                            Discuss the key terms and definitions used in the food
                            Food Processing Industry and HACCP
                            Food processing industry is one of the most vital industries worldwide as it derives its importance from the importance of food itself to human life. This industry can be defined as “the type of industries in which agricultural products (either plant- or animal- based) are transformed into food, or in which one form of food is converted into another form of food". 
                            Food industry includes a number of processes and methods that range from simple food processing methods (as in household food manufacturing) to very complicated and high-technology techniques.
                            Thus, and due to the complexity of processes, methods and techniques that are used in the food manufacturing industry, this industry was classified according to the processing level/extent or according to the type/category of processed foods. 
                            processing industry and food safety disciplines.
                            Classification of Food Processing Industries
                            A- Classification according to processing level/extent
                            Food industries can be classified according to the processing level/extent to the following three sections:
                            Primary food processing
                            Secondary food processing
                            Tertiary food processing
                            At this stage, raw agricultural products are turned into ready to be consumed food (like in case of the cleaning and packaging of harvested fruits) or to be converted into an ingredient that will be used in further food processing steps (like in case of milling wheat grains into flour).

                        Classification of Food Processing Industries
                        B- Classification according to the type or category of food:
                        Another classification of food processing industries is according to the type or category of food being processed that is as follows:

                            Processing of meat, poultry, and fish.
                            Processing of fruits and vegetables.
                            Manufacturing of oil and fats.
                            Manufacturing of milk and dairy products.
                            Manufacturing of grain milling products, starches, and starch products.
                            Manufacturing of bakery and pasta products.
                            Manufacturing of sugar, chocolate, and confectionary.
                            Manufacturing of beverages.
                            Manufacturing of other food products.
                            "Food Processing?”
                            Foods are processed for a number of reasons that can be summarized as follows:
                                Processing of foods is a way to guarantee the safety of foods and remove or reduce contamination.
                                Food processing preserves foods, extends their shelf life, and makes food available beyond their harvest season.
                                Food processing makes food edible and more palatable and improves the quality of foods.
                                Food processing offers a greater variety and forms of food and therefore increases the consumer’s choice.
                            In this course, our focus will be on ensuring the safety of foods in the food processing industry as one of the most important quality requirements of food through the application of the HACCP food safety system.

                        Hazard or Risk?

                        Hazard and risk are two terms that are commonly used within the discipline of food safety. Although they are different terms, they are closely related to each other as risk cannot be considered without the presence of a hazard, while the effect of a particular hazard can only be studied with regard to the risk. 
                        Still need to know more? Let’s see the meaning of each of them...
                        Hazard
                        Risk
                        It is a biological, chemical, or physical factor or agent in food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. In some references, hazards include allergens as the fourth type.
                        Types of Hazards

                        Food safety hazards occur when food is subjected to harmful agents that cause contamination of the food. Food hazards can be classified into four main groups that are: biological, chemical, physical hazards, and allergens. Please note that in some references, allergens are considered to be included under the chemical hazards type.

                        On the following pages, we are going to study some common food safety hazards under each category.
                        Biological Hazards
                        Biological food safety hazards simply mean “any living pathogenic organism that can be present or introduced to food, which in turn poses a threat to the consumer's health.” Biological hazards can exist in a number of environments and surrounding areas (air, soil, water,, etc.) in addition to the food itself. Anyway food type and handling conditions are key factors that determine the extent and magnitude of microbial growth. Biological hazards have four main groups, i.e., bacteria, viruses, parasites, and prions.
                        Bacteria
                        Viruses
                        Parasites
                        Prions
                        Bacteria are single-cell microorganisms that live in a wide range of environmental conditions and foods. In the discipline of food safety, we focus on pathogenic bacteria or those with the ability to cause harm to consumers’ health and well-being when present in food. Some examples of pathogenic bacteria are: Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, etc.
                        Chemical Hazards
                        Chemical food safety hazards are chemical compounds or substances that, when are present or introduced to food, will have the potential to cause adverse health effects to the consumer. The sources of such hazards are widely varied and can range from chemical hazards that are naturally occurring in food or raw materials, those that are formed during food processing and those that are added during food production or handling. 
                        Naturally occurring
                        Intentionally added
                        Unintentionally added
                        Environmental contaminants
                        Food processing-induced chemicals
                        These are the toxins produced by plants or animals themselves and the microorganisms that might grow on food. Examples are: mycotoxins (e.g. aflatoxin and ochratoxin), glycoalcaloids (in potatoes for example), marine toxins (like ciguatoxin and Okadaic acid), cyanogenic glycoside (like in case of cassava roots) .. etc
                        Scoring of Risk Elements
                        Example for Risk Calculations
                        Suppose that you are asked to determine the risk of two hazards in a particular food, and after doing the necessary research and studies, you find the following:
                        Hazard A: It rarely occurs in such food, and if present, it is found to be associated with minimal customer inconvenience.
                        Hazard B: It occurs sporadically, but if present, it causes the hospitalization of the affected individuals and needs long-term medical treatment.
                        How would you calculate the risk score?
                        Answer:
                        What is the Third Element of Risk Assessment?
                        In addition to the likelihood and severity of a particular hazard, sometimes, and where appropriate, we use a third element to determine the risk of such a hazard; this element is the “Frequency of exposure.” The frequency of exposure to a particular hazard is a measure of how much and for how many times a consumer is exposed to a particular hazard. This may vary from an “irregular basis” to a “continuous basis. “ In this case, the risk score can be obtained by multiplying the scores of the three risk elements.
                        Terms and Definitions
                        Here we are going to review some key terms and definitions that will be helpful for us throughout the course. These definitions are mainly with reference to Codex Alimentarius Commission (CXC 1-1969, modified 2020.

                        Lesson Summary

                            The food processing industry is one of the most important industries worldwide and is defined as “the industry in which agricultural products are transformed into food, or in which one form of food is converted into another form of food.
                             The food processing industry can be classified under three main levels,  i.e.,   primary, secondary, and tertiary food processing. 
                             Food safety is the term used to describe the assurance that food will not cause any adverse health effect to the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use. 
                             HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a risk-based approach that works on the identification of hazards and the classification of food production stages or steps according to their risk level or the extent of threat they might pose to the safety of food. 
                             HACCP system is now the globally recognized food safety system and is the key system to setting up risk-based food regulations based on a sound scientific basis and a systematic approach. 
                            Learning Outcomes
                            Having completed this module you will be able to:
                                Explain what HACCP prerequisite programs are and their importance.
                                Describe the design requirements of food processing establishments.
                                Explain personal hygiene and proper food handling practices in food establishments.

                                Describe the flow diagram of a given food product and its element
                                HACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)
                                In order to implement the HACCP food safety system in your food processing establishment, three phases have to be applied in a specific order that is:
                                First phase: Application of HACCP Prerequisite programs (PRPs).
                                Second phase: Application of HACCP preliminary steps (5 steps).
                                Third phase: Implementation of HACCP principles (7 Principles).
                                In our training course, we will study, in a step-by-step manner, how to effectively implement each of these three phases in order to have a well-established HACCP food safety system in place.


                        12. Deviation
                        HACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)
                        Prerequisite Programs (PRPs) are a set of programs that should be in place prior to the application of HACCP in any food production establishment. PRPs are defined by Codex Alimentarius  (CXC 1-1969, modified 2020) as “Programs including Good Hygiene Practices, Good Agricultural Practices, and Good Manufacturing Practices, as well as other practices and procedures such as training and traceability, that establish the basic environmental and operating conditions that set the foundation for implementation of a HACCP system.” 
                        In ISO 22000:2018 standard on Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS), PRPs were defined as the “basic conditions and activities that are necessary within the organization and throughout the food chain to maintain food safety.”

                        From these definitions, we have seen that PRPs are the basic foundation for the establishment of the HACCP system. Failure (or improper) implementation of PRPs will lead by its turn to failure in the further implementation of the HACCP system.
                        HACCP Prerequisite Programs (PRPs)
                        As we mentioned before, one of the characteristics of HACCP is that it can be applied at any stage of the food production chain, including primary production, food processing, catering, food services, distribution, and retail activities. In this module of our training course, we will focus on the PRPs that are related to the area of the food processing industry.
                        On the following pages, we are going to review some examples (a non-exhaustive list) of key PRPs that have to be in place prior for the implementation of the HACCP system in the food processing industry. Our study list will include the following elements:
                        1- Building (design, infrastructure, and equipment)
                        2- Personal hygiene.

                        3- Cleaning and disinfection.

                        4- Pest control.

                        5- Training and competence.

                        6- Water and air quality.

                        7- Waste management.

                        8- Supplier control.
                        1- Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)
                        The following examples of building requirements should be met at any food processing establishment to ensure a hygienic food processing environment:
                        • First of all, the risks from the building surrounding areas, potential contamination sources, flooding, water supply, etc. have to be carefully assessed.
                        • When designing the layout of a food processing establishment, strict consideration should be taken to separate the processing areas that are different in their risk level. This separation can be carried out either by physical insulation or by separation in time (like performing cleaning procedures in between different tasks).
                        • Floors should be non-absorbent, non-slippery, waterproof, and have a suitable slope to facilitate the removal of cleaning water or spilled liquids.

                        9- Control of operations.
                        Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)
                        Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)
                        • Hand washing facilities should be positioned at the entry points to food handling areas. Liquid soap and sanitizers should be provided in addition to proper hand drying means such as single-use towels or hot air dryers. The use of cloth towels is prohibited.
                        • Walls have to be of durable materials, washable, easy to clean, and don’t pose any contamination to foods that are being processed in the establishment.
                        • Sufficient storage facilities should be available for different production inputs and outputs (raw materials, processing aids, processed foods, packaging materials, cleaning chemicals, etc.).
                        • Walls have to be of durable materials, washable, easy to clean, and don’t pose any contamination to foods that are being processed in the establishment.

                        • Doors should be smooth and made of non-absorbent materials. It is recommended to use automatic or mechanical systems for opening and closing the doors to prevent contamination by touching.
                        • Sufficient storage facilities should be available for different production inputs and outputs (raw materials, processing aids, processed foods, packaging materials, cleaning chemicals, etc.).
                        • Sufficient and adequate sources of lighting should be available in all areas. Light sources have to be covered to prevent food contamination in case of light bulb breakage.
                        Building (Design, Infrastructure and Equipment)
                        • Toilets or bathrooms shouldn’t open directly to the production or food handling areas in order to prevent cross-contamination.
                        • Staff changing rooms should be available, clean and in good order. Proper separation between working and daily clothes should be in place.

                        • Devices that are used for measuring, monitoring, or recording, such as thermometers and pH meters, should be kept clean and sanitized. These devices should be available in appropriate numbers and conditions.
                        • Caution should be taken to prevent the different ways of cross-contamination of foods during processing and handling (e.g., contamination from the environment, from the equipment, by raw materials, by tools, and by cleaning chemicals)
                        Personal Hygiene

                        • Clean personnel clothing with a minimum number of (or no) pockets has to be in place. No jewelry or accessories are allowed as they might pose a contamination threat to foods. A hair net and beard cover (when applicable) have to be considered too.
                        • Rooms assigned for eating/drinking and smoking room have to be well separated from food handling areas.
                        • Visits by external persons have to follow the same rules of personal hygiene that applies to food personnel in the establishment.
                        Supplier Control
                        • Consideration should be given not only to the supply of raw materials themselves but also to the supply of food additives, packaging materials, food contact material, and processing aids.
                        • A strict supply policy containing agreement on specifications (e.g. microbiological criteria) and hygiene assurance and/or requesting quality management system certificates can be taken into account in the extent of details on the PRPs and HACCP plan of the establishment itself.
                        • In addition to agreements with and potential auditing of the supplier (or what is called a 2nd party audit), a number of factors, including adherence to the agreed delivery period, homogeneity of delivered goods, the accuracy of information added, adequate shelf life or freshness, use of clean and well-equipped transportation, the proper temperature during transport, and long transit times and the awareness level of food hygiene on the part of the driver and other food handlers transporting the food, may provide a good indication of the supplier's dependability. A reception control should address most of these problems. It can be required to be informed of a transport vehicle's prior loads in order to put in place sufficient hygienic measures and reduce the risk of contamination.
                        • The supplier's instructions, like "first in, first out" or "first expire, first out" principles, and accessibility to stored foods for inspection from all directions, should all be considered when determining storage conditions at the supplier’s establishment itself.
                        Control of Operations
                        Incoming raw materials and ingredients :
                        • To ensure that they are clean and acceptable for processing, raw materials or ingredients must be examined, sorted, or handled hygienically and properly.
                        • In order to verify that only safe, acceptable raw materials or substances are used, laboratory testing should be performed as needed.
                        • Specifications for raw materials should be determined and used as needed.
                        • Ingredients and raw materials must be correctly identified and rotated through the stock process.
                        • Rework materials must be kept in the proper containers and kept in storage settings that will guard against contamination and deterioration. Only materials that pass the prescribed specifications shall be allowed for rework.
                        • Ingredients and raw materials that have been frozen must be kept frozen. If defrosting is necessary before use, it must be done in a way that avoids contamination and degradation.
                        Control of Operations
                        Packaging Materials:
                        Packaging materials must offer sufficient protection for goods to reduce contamination, avoid damage, and allow for correct labeling.
                        • The packing material's food-contact surface must not present a risk for contaminant migration to the food.
                        • There should be a system for dealing with shattered glass in food or nearby surroundings when packing material is comprised of breakable glass.
                        • Reusable packaging must be strong enough to endure repeated use and be easy to clean and disinfect. Reusable packaging must also be prevented from endangering the quality and safety of food by using well-established and efficient means.
                        Control of Operations
                        Microbiological cross-contamination
                        Raw, unprocessed food should be effectively separated from processed or ready-to-eat food, either by using physical means or time separation by performing cleaning and, if necessary, disinfection procedures in between different times.
                        • Surfaces, utensils, equipment fixtures, and fittings that come into direct contact with food must be properly cleaned. For raw or unprocessed food and processed food, there must be, when necessary, specific utensils, equipment, and tools for each.
                        • Access must be limited or controlled in situations where there is a high risk of microbial contamination. If necessary, staff may need to wash their hands and put on clean protective clothing and footwear before entering such places. Access to such areas shall only be permitted through a changing facility

                        HACCP Preliminary Steps
                        Before the application of HACCP principles, five preliminary (preparatory) steps have to be conducted; these steps are as follows.
                        Step 1: Assemble HACCP Team and Identify Scope
                        The first preliminary step when it comes to the application of the HACCP food safety system in the food industry is the assembly of the HACCP team. The FDA defines the HACCP team as “The group of people who are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the HACCP system within a food manufacturing organization.”
                        This team, which includes all parts of the food industry involved with the product, should include a wide range of specific knowledge and expertise appropriate to the product under consideration, its production (manufacture, storage, and distribution), its consumption, and the associated potential hazards, as well as many higher management levels as possible. This can be accomplished by creating a multidisciplinary team responsible for various operations activities such as production, quality control, storage, maintenance, cleaning, disinfection, etc. It is very important that the HACCP team should have full commitment and support from the management, which should regard itself as the owner of the HACCP plan and, overall, the Food Safety Management System (FSMS).
                        HACCP Team: Expertise and Scope
                        What if the relevant expertise is not available within the food establishment?
                        In this case, other expert sources, including independent experts, trade and industry groups, competent authorities, HACCP literature, and HACCP manuals, should be considered. A well-trained individual with access to such guidance may be able to implement a HACCP System in the establishment. The HACCP team may employ an externally designed generic HACCP plan when appropriate, but it must be adapted to the food operations that are actually implemented in the establishment.
                        Specialists and technicians within the HACCP team may include:
                        · Those who are aware of the different food safety hazards (biological, chemical, or physical) associated with a specific product group.
                        · Those with enough understanding of the hygiene and functioning of the plant processes and equipment.
                        · Those who are in charge of or closely associated with the technical aspects of processing the food product under consideration.

                        The HACCP team should determine the scope of the HACCP system as well as any prerequisite programs. The scope should specify which types of foods are being processed within the food establishment and the procedures used as well.
                        What are the Roles of HACCP Team?
                        The HACCP team is characterized by the several and multiple roles that are assigned to its members. It is up to each food establishment to decide whether these roles are assigned to specific team members or whether certain team members can perform multiple tasks. One person may fill some or all of these jobs in a small food business. Thus, and to avoid overlapping responsibilities, it is beneficial to divide the roles within the HACCP team into the following four categories: administrative, technical, operational, and other roles.
                        Administrative
                        Technical
                        Operational
                        Other roles
                        Members of the administrative group will be in charge of ensuring that the HACCP process is carried out in a logical and well-documented manner. They will usually require a thorough understanding of the HACCP proces
                        The HACCP Team Leader
                        The HACCP team leader is the person specified in the HACCP food safety system to be in charge of managing the HACCP plan and thus should have strong management and communication abilities. He/she should have a solid understanding of HACCP as well as a thorough awareness of the food operations included in the food products that are processed in the establishment and the technical information that supports it.
                        The choice of the person designated as the HACCP team leader can be proven by documenting any relevant training completed (for example, accredited training in the application of HACCP principles), certifications obtained (like relevant qualifications in the area of food science, technology, safety or microbiology), and relevant experience in the field.
                        Role of the HACCP Team Leader
                        The role of HACCP team leader can be summarized as follows:

                            Ensuring that the composition of the HACCP team is meeting the requirements for implementing the HACCP food safety system.
                            Making changes to the HACCP team when necessary.
                            Coordination of HACCP team activities and work.
                            Ensuring that the scope of work is achieved.
                            Chairing HACCP team meetings in a smooth and interactive way between members.
                            Ensuring that the established HACCP plan is being implemented properly.
                            Being the representative of the HACCP team before the management.
                            Informing the management of the required time, costs, and personnel for achieving the HACCP plan.

                        Functions and Required Skills in the HACCP Team
                        The functions of the HACCP team members in the light of the aforementioned four categories of roles (i.e., administrative, technical, operational, and other) can be described as follows:
                        Administrative
                        Technical
                        Operational
                        Other
                        Functions:
                        • Selection of the HACCP team.
                        • Managing different HACCP processes
                        • Establishing a HACCP plan.
                        • Addressing the strong and weak points in the HACCP system work with the aim of improvement.
                        • Determining the training requirements for HACCP team members.
                        Skills:
                        • Strong management, administrative and communication skills.
                        • Good knowledge of HACCP requirements and processes
                        • Strong planning, analysis, and implementation skills.
                        Step 2: Describe product(s)

                        A complete product description should be created, for example, the origin of ingredients/raw materials which may help recognize certain hazards, relevant safety information such as composition, physical/chemical properties, processing methods/technologies, packaging, durability/shelf life, storage conditions, and method of distribution.  
                        For the purpose of developing the HACCP plan, food businesses with multiple goods may find it useful to categorize items with comparable characteristics and processing stages. Any limits relevant to the food product that has already been established for hazards, such as limits for food additives, regulatory microbiological criteria, maximum allowed veterinary medicine residues, and times and temperatures for heat treatments prescribed by competent authorities, should be considered and accounted for in the HACCP plan.
                        Lesson Summary

                            Prerequisite Programs (PRPs) are a set of programs that should be in place prior to the application of the HACCP food safety system in any food production establishment.
                            HACCP prerequisite programs include a number of hygienic requirements and practices, amongst which are building design, personal hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, pest control, training /competence, water/air quality, waste management, supplier control, control of operations, transportation, and product information.
                            Without the proper application of PRPs, the application of the HACCP system will not succeed.
                            Standard Operating Procedures, or SOPs, are written practices and procedures that are important to producing safe food. It is essential to have these SOPs in place and to have all food-handling personnel trained to use them.
                            The HACCP team is the group of people who are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the HACCP system within a food manufacturing organization.
                            The HACCP team has administrative, technical, and operational roles in the HACCP system

                                The Seven Principles of HACCP
                                After we have completed the preparatory stage of the HACCP food safety system, which included the prerequisite programs (PRPs) and the five preliminary HACCP steps, now comes the time for the implementation of the principles of HACCP. HACCP food safety system has seven principles (steps) that all have to be fully applied in the correct order. These principles are shown below:
                                Principle 1: Conduct a Hazard Analysis
                                Hazard is defined by Codex Alimentarius as any “biological, chemical or physical agent in food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect” (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020). Accordingly, hazard analysis is the term used to describe “the process of collecting and evaluating the information on hazards associated with the food under consideration to decide which are significant and must be addressed in the HACCP plan” this includes the information on hazards identified in raw materials and other ingredients, the food processing environment, and conditions leading to their presence to decide whether or not these are significant hazards. Thus, this principle can be properly implemented by following two sub-steps that are:
                                • P1A- listing of all relevant and potential hazard


                                • P1B- Identification of control measures
                                On the next pages, we are going to study these principles in detai

                        Considerations When Conducting a Hazard Analysis?
                        The following considerations have to be taken by the HACCP team when conducting the hazard analysis:


                             • The risk level of the identified hazards by determining the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of hazards and severity of their adverse health effects (please see Module 1 of this course).
                             • Evaluation of the presence of identified hazards by using the proper qualitative and/or quantitative methods.
                             • The nature of the facility and the equipment used in making the food product.
                             • To what extent can pathogenic micro-organisms survive/multiply during the food manufacturing processes and the generation or formation of undesirable chemicals in both intermediate and end products, production line, and the line surrounding environment.
                             • Production (or presence) of harmful microbial metabolism products (such as mycotoxins), as well as chemical hazards (including allergens) or physical agents.
                             • To what extent can contamination (or recontamination) by any type of hazard (biological, chemical, or physical) occur at any stage of food processing (raw materials, intermediate products, or end products).
                             • The intended use and/or probability of product mishandling by potential consumers that result in the food becoming unsafe.
                        Common Sources of Hazards
                        The common sources of hazards (biological, chemical, and physical) in the food manufacturing industry, which are to be considered when conducting a hazard analysis, can be classified according to their sources:
                        Ingredient-related hazards
                        Process-related hazards
                        Facility-related hazards
                        People-related hazards
                         Those are the hazards that arise from the contamination of raw materials and other ingredients that are included in food formulations.
                        On the following pages, we are going to study some examples of the potential sources of biological, chemical, and physical hazards in the food processing industry according to this classification. (Source: FDA Draft Guidance for Industry: Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food, 2018).

                        • L. monocytogenes (e.g., raw agricultural commodities, other contaminated products used as ingredients)
                        Parasites:
                        • Cryptosporidium parvum (contaminated water used as an ingredient)
                        • Cyclospora cayetanensis (berries)               • Toxoplasma gondii (meat).

                        • Packaging materials.
                        5 - Establish Corrective Actions
                        The fifth principle of HACCP food safety system is the establishment of corrective actions. Corrective action is defined as “any action taken when a deviation occurs in order to re-establish control, segregate and determine the disposition of the affected product if any and prevent or minimize reoccurrence of the deviation” (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020).
                        Correction, Corrective Actions & Preventive Actions
                        Before we proceed to learn more about the corrective actions, we need to differentiate between three terms, i.e., correction, corrective actions and preventive actions.
                        Correction
                        Corrective action
                        Preventive action
                        A correction means taking action in a timely manner to identify and correct a minor and isolated problem that does not directly impact prod
                        Deviation Procedures

                        Deviation is defined by Codex Alimentarius as the “failure to meet a critical limit “. Deviation procedures are a set of documented actions that are "predetermined to be taken when a loss of control (deviation) occurs at a CCP". All deviations have to be controlled by taking the necessary actions to eliminate or correct the source or the “root cause” of the deviation and to control all food products that were manufactured during the deviation period. The affected foods during the deviation have to be identified and isolated for further decisions that will be taken by the responsible HACCP team members.
                        Does any deviation require corrective actions to be taken?
                        Actually, the term “corrective actions” is taken when a deviation occurs from the critical limits at any CCP, but sometimes the action taken is called “process adjustment” which is applied only to the deviations from what is so called “target limits” (without exceeding the critical limits). To be clearer, let’s have a look at the next example.
                        uct safety.
                        As applies for each identified CCP, corrective actions have to be considered and planned before the deviation from critical limits takes place. This will enable the HACCP te
                        Corrective Actions or Process Adjustments?

                        Example:
                        In the production of pasteurized milk, a critical limit for the heat treatment was set to be 75oC, but under practical conditions, if we adjust the heaters’ temperature to achieve 75oC accurate, the situation will be subjected to deviation from the critical limit if any small decrease occurred in the treatment temperature, 
                        ow to Conduct Corrective Actions?
                        Corrective actions can be conducted through the following steps:
                        1- Identification and correction of the cause of deviation or non-compliance;

                        2-Determination the disposition of non-compliant products (foods manufactured during the deviation period).

                        3- Documentation of the corrective actions that have been taken.
                        Dealing With Affected Food Products?
                        In general, there are three ways that can be used to deal with the affected food products that were manufactured during the periods of deviation from the critical limits at a CCP. These ways are: reprocessing, diversion or destruction.
                        Reprocessing
                        Diversion
                        Destruction
                        In this case, food products that didn’t meet the required CCP condition are reprocessed again after the corrective actions are taken to eliminate the cause of deviation.
                        Example 1: Monitoring detected that the amount of preservative added to food is less than the required percentage (0.07%). Action taken: correct the cause, adjust the amount of added preservative and then reprocess the food.
                        Example 2: Monitoring detected that juice didn’t reach the required temperature during the heat treatment. Action: correct the cause, fix the temperature as required and re-pasteurize the affected juice batches.
                        N.B. The corrective actions taken have to ensure that the CCP conditions have been brought once again under control. Moreover, food that is potentially unsafe (was produced during the deviation period) has to be handled appropriately to avoid its contact with other safe foods in the establishment, and that it does not reach consumers.
                        Actions taken should include segregating the affected product and analyzing its safety to ensure proper disposition.

                        Thus, and in order to overcome this issue, another limit is set to be more stringent than the critical limit values which is called target or (operational) limit (80 oC as shown in this example). This will provide food manufacturers with extra assurances that the minimum temperature will be consistently achieved and that any small decrease occurs around the target limit (for up to 4 degrees) will not result in a deviation in the critical limits. In other words, target limits are used to provide a safety margin to allow extra time to fix the process before the critical limits are being deviated.
                        am to promptly and properly take the necessary and required actions.
                        What to be included in the corrective actions?
                        When establishing corrective actions, the following information has to be recorded and to be available.
                        • Who is responsible for conducting the corrective actions?
                        • How and what type of corrective action are to be taken?
                        • What to do with the foods products that were manufactured during the deviation period?
                        • Keeping records of the actions taken with the relevant information like date, time, actions taken .

                        • Pits or pit fragments, shells.

                        Viruses:
                        • Norovirus (produce, shellfish)        • Hepatitis A virus (produce, fruits).
                        6- Validation of HACCP Plan & Procedures
                        A- Validation of the HACCP plan
                        Before the HACCP team starts to implement the HACCP plan in their food processing establishment, they have to ensure that the elements of planned HACCP food safety system are capable of effectively and adequately controlling the food safety hazards (biological, chemical and physical) that are related to their food products. 
                        These elements include:
                        • Identification and evaluation of food safety hazards.
                        • Control measures.
                        • Identification of critical control points
                        • Setting the proper critical limits.
                        • Frequency and type of monitoring procedures at each CCPs.
                        • Corrective actions taken when deviation occurs.
                        • Frequency and type of verification.
                        • The adequacy and efficacy of the documentation system.
                        Validation of he Control Measures
                        Validation of HACCP control measures can be defined as “obtaining evidence that a control measure or combination of control measures, if properly implemented, is capable of controlling the hazard to a specified outcome " (CXC 1-1969, updated 2020)”. This validation is carried out during the development of HACCP plan and prior to its implementation. Validation is basically a scientific-based process and the obtained evidences should be scientifically correct and sound.
                        Sources for control measures validation may include:


                        • Relevant regulations and standards.
                        • Scientific and technical literature.
                        • Laboratory testing (like process conditions-mimic testing).
                        • Mathematical modeling (like kinetic modeling of bacterial growth).
                        • Surveys.
                        • Expert advice.
                        N.B. In some cases, the situation requires to perform what is called subsequent validation (or revalidation). Examples for such cases are: system failure, a significant change in product or process, the recognition of new hazards and new regulatory or scientific information
                        What About Verification?
                        B- Verification Procedures
                        Immediately after HACCP food safety system is put into place and is being implemented, procedures should be established to ensure the system is operating efficiently, or in other words, to ensure that the system is functioning as planned. Thus, verification can be defined as “the application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addition to monitoring, to determine whether a control measure is or has been operating as intended”. 
                        Following is a list of some verification activities:
                        • Ensuring that control measures are in place and that they are in accordance with the HACCP plan.
                        • Reviewing the whole HACCP system to ensure that it is operating as planned.
                        • Confirmation that CCPs are under control by reviewing the monitoring records.
                        • Review of undertaken corrective actions in case of deviations from critical limits.
                        • Review of calibration procedures and records to ensure the accuracy of devices used for of CCPs.
                        • Sampling and testing the different raw materials, operations, environment and food products for different food safety hazards.
                        • Review of modifications of the HACCP plan.
                        Validation, Verification and Monitoring
                        The difference between three terms “validation”, “verification” and “monitoring” is a source of confusion for many food specialists and technicians. Following is an example to help you distinguish between these different terms:
                        Example:
                        The pasteurization step is the principal treatment in the processing of pasteurized bottle milk. Pasteurization is a microbiocidal heat treatment aimed at reducing the number of any pathogenic microorganisms in milk and liquid milk products, if present, to a level at which they do not constitute a significant health hazard. Pasteurization conditions are designed to effectively destroy the organisms Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnettii. This step is the only treatment that is designed specifically to control the pathogenic bacteria; thus, it is considered as a CCP in the processing of this product. 
                        A table describing the difference between the aforementioned three terms applied to this step is shown on the next page.
                        Practical HACCP
                        In this topic, we are going to learn how to practically implement the HACCP preliminary steps and principles and how to make the necessary documents for each. We preferred to include different examples from a collection of food processing industry types to ensure that trainees will acquire knowledge in the application of the HACCP food safety systems in various areas of the food processing industry. So, we will study how to construct and perform the following tasks:

                            Establish critical limits at each CCP
                            Monitoring activities
                            Corrective action
                            Verification procedures
                            Assembling the HACCP Team (Example)
                            This is an example of a HACCP team structure in a food processing establishment. In this case, the HACCP team consists of seven people; the team leader, secretary, four members, and one external consultant. Please note that the number of the HACCP team depends on many factors, such as the size of the establishment and the nature of processed foods.

                        Product Description and Intended Use (Example)
                        This is an example of a product description of a food product (Sliced wheat bread). The format used to describe this product is the common one recommended by FDA, which includes the following information:
                        Product name, description (including important food safety characteristics), ingredients, packaging type, intended use and consumers, shelf life, labeling instructions (related to safety), and storage and distribution aspects.
                        Lesson Summary

                            HACCP food safety system includes the application of seven principles.
                            Hazard analysis is the term used to describe “the process of collecting and evaluating the information on hazards associated with the food under consideration to decide which are significant and must be addressed in the HACCP plan.”
                            Hazard analysis includes the listing of all relevant and potential hazards and the Identification of control measures.
                            Control measures are those actions or activities that can prevent, eliminate, or minimize the impact or the probability of occurrence of hazards to acceptable levels.
                            A critical control point (CCP) is defined as “A step at which a control measure or control measures, essential to control a significant hazard, is/are applied in a HACCP system.”
                            Critical control points can be identified by using deci

                        Criminal Psychology: Confession and Interrogation
                        Lesson Summary
                        The key contents covered in the module are the following:

                            The Reid technique of interrogation construes interrogation as the psychological undoing of deception.
                            The tactics of effective interrogation are dependent upon the interrogator coming across as confident and fully knowledgeable about the case.
                            The three main ways in which an interrogator confronts a suspect are direct accusation, evidence strategy and supported direct accusation.
                            The most common tactic of the interview involves the police officer pointing to a contradiction or an inconsistency in the suspect’s statement.
                            The presence of a solicitor and previous prison experience markedly reduces the likelihood of suspects’ confessing.
                            In April 1995, the detainees’ right to silence was modified under sections 34 and 37 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The middle sentence of the current police caution warns of possible adverse inference of the detainees’ right to silence.
                            The three categories of interview tactics are delivery, maximisation and manipulation.
                            The impact of interview tactics can be determined from the responses of the interviewee and the observations and evaluation of the behavioural symptoms throughout the interview process.

                        Lesson Summary
                        The key points from this module are:


                        Transport Management System (TMS) - A Transportation Management System (TMS) is a subset of Supply Chain Management (SCM) that deals with the planning, execution and optimization of the physical movement of goods.

                        TMS is a platform that is designed to streamline the shipping process. It is offered as a module within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and SCM suites that help organizations move inbound – procurement – and outbound – shipment – freight using tools like route planning and optimization, yard management, carrier management, etc.
                        TMS handles four important operations of transport management:
                        ●  Planning             ●  Transportation execution              ●  Transportation follow-up            ●  Measurement
                        Benefits of TMS - A fully deployed TMS can benefit organizations in the following ways:   
                        ●  Technological capabilities    ●  Simplify processes    ●  Transport intelligence     ●  Reduce invoice errors
                        ●  Track freight    ●  Supply chain visibility & inventory management    ●  Transportation order planning & execution
                        The Challenges of TMS include the following:
                        ●  Keeping quotes organized      ●  Selecting the best carrier         ●  Tracking shipments      ●  Gathering insights

                        Learning Outcomes
                        By the end of this module, you will be able to:

                            Define electrolysis and redox reactions
                            Describe electrolysis cell composition and redox reactions in the electrolysis cell
                            Discuss the concept of quantitative electrolysis
                            Indicate the amount of a substance produced during electrolysis and the Avogadro constant by an electrolytic method
                            Explain how to use charge, current & time triangle for the amount of charge “Q”, and how to find the charge on one mole of electrons experimentally 

                        Redox Reactions
                        Redox reactions are oxidation-reduction reactions in which electrons transfer between reactants.
                        During redox reactions, one of the reactants oxidises (it loses electrons), and the other is reduced (it gains electrons).
                        Another, more specific definition of redox reactions involves the transfer of oxygen and hydrogen between chemical species. The following are some examples of redox reactions:
                        Iron rusts, forming iron oxides.
                        Iron rusts, forming iron oxides.

                            Metal corrosion (iron rust) is caused by oxygen in water, oxidising iron into oxides.
                            Combustion reactions: The combustion reactions are redox reactions in which hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water.
                            Respiration: Redox reactions convert the food we consume into energy.
                            Photosynthesis: The reaction between water and carbon dioxide to give glucose and oxygen is a redox reaction in which water becomes oxidised, and carbon dioxide becomes reduced.

                        Usually, metals to the left of the periodic table oxidise by losing electrons, and nonmetals to the right reduce by gaining electrons.

                            • Manganese change oxidation state from +7 (MnO4− ) to +2 (Mn2+)
                        Electrolysis
                        The electrolysis cell is an electrochemical cell that employs an electric source to force a chemical reaction. Some pure elements are often extracted from their compounds using this method. Typically, some of these elements are metals at the top of the reactivity series that cannot be extracted from their ores when heated with carbon. It is also used to prepare nonmetals such as chlorine gas and in electroplating.
                        The electrolysis cell is used to prepare chlorine gas.
                        The electrolysis cell is used to prepare chlorine ga

                        The full oxidation equation is:
                                     5Cu + 2KMnO4 + 8H2SO4 → 5CuSO4 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4+ 8H2O
                        The Chemical Reactivity Series
                        We list elements in the chemical reactivity series in decreasing order of chemical reactivity. Elements at the top of the chemical reactivity series replace lower elements.
                        Electrolysis Cell Composition
                        The electrolysis cell consists of two electrodes (conductive metals or carbon) connected to a power supply and dipped in an electrolyte. The negative wire of the power supply connects to the cathode and the positive to the anode.
                        Usually, the anode is where negative ions lose electrons, and the cathode is where positive ions reduce to their elements.
                        Redox Reactions in the Electrolysis Cell
                        Electrolytes are prepared by dissolving metal salts in water or by melting salts.
                        Salts dissociate in water into positive and negative ions (cations and anions). For example, copper (II) sulfate electrolyte (CuSO4) dissociates into Cu2+ ions (cations) and SO42- ions (anions). Zinc (II) chloride dissociates into Zn2+ ions, and Cl− is another electrolyte used in electrolysis cells.
                        Silver Chloride (AgCl)
                        Reaction at the anode (loss of electrons)
                        Reaction at the cathode (gain of electrons)
                        Oxidation happens at the anode.
                        For example:
                        The electrolyte silver chloride (AgCl) electrolyte dissociates into Ag+ and Cl− ions.
                        At the anode, chloride ions lose electrons and change into chlorine gas (oxidise).
                        2Cl−→ Cl2 + 2e−
                        Another reaction occurs at the anode.
                        Silver chloride is dissolved in water; the water
                        Notes About the Electrolysis Cell

                            At the anode, anions lose electrons (oxidised). At the cathode, cations gain electrons (reduced).
                            Ionic compounds used in electrolysis cells are either salts dissolved in water or molten salts to allow ions to move freely (ions in a solid state don’t move).
                            The chemical reaction is driven by an external electrical source (a battery).
                            The redox reaction is forced by electrical energy (not spontaneously).
                            Redox reactions occur in the same container. Both electrodes are placed in a single container.
                            Electrons move from the anode to the cathode.
                            Ions discharge at both electrodes. Positively charged ions move to the cathode, whereas negatively charged ions move to the anode.

                            The electrodes used in electrolysis cells must conduct electricity for the electrons to pass and for the redox reactions to occur.
                            Although graphite is a non-metal, it is used as an electrode because it has delocalised electrons that conduct electricity.
                            Due to graphite's high melting point, graphite electrodes do not melt in molten salts. (graphite forms giant molecular structures held together by strong covalent bonds).
                            Negative ions (anions) are attracted to the anode because the anode is connected to the positive pole of the power supply (+ve).
                            Positive ions (cations) are attracted to the cathode because the cathode is connected to the negative pole of the power supply (−ve).

                        itself is hydrolysed due to the passing current.

                        Quantitative Electrolysis

                        We have seen that electrolysis results in metal deposits at the cathode. It is critical to understand the amount of current and time required to obtain a specific mass of an element during the manufacturing of metals such as aluminium.
                        The mass of the produced substance is proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through the electrodes in coulombs.

                        The deposited mass is proportional to the current strength and the time it takes to pass.

                        4OH−→ O2 + 2H2O + 4e−
                        Charge, Current & Time Triangle
                        We can express the relation between charge and current using charge, current & time triangle

                        We usually use Faraday (F) to express the quantity of electricity carried by one mole of electrons.
                                                                                      
                                                 1 Faraday = 96500 Coulombs
                        This means one mole of electrons carries a quantity of electricity equal to 96500 coulombs.
                        Example 1

                        In the silver chloride (AgCl) example.
                        We need 1 F (96500 C) of electricity to deposit one mole of silver.

                        Current (I) = 1.70 A

                        Calculating the Avogadro Constant

                        Calculating the Avogadro constant by an electrolytic method
                        We talked in the Beginner Chemistry: Mole Calculations & Chemical Bonds Course about Avogadro’s constant and that it is the number of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) found in one mole of a substance.
                        One mole of a substance = Avogadro’s number “L” (6.02 x 1023 atoms, molecules, or ions).
                        Likewise, one mole of electrons contains the same number of electrons.
                        One mole of electrons = Avogadro’s number (6.02 x 1023 electrons).
                        We can use electrolysis to find the charge associated with one mole of electrons.
                        Avogadro Constant (Recap)
                        One mole of any element contains the same number of atoms (6.02 x 1023 atoms), but they differ in their masses (due to the difference in the number of protons, and neutrons).
                        To understand Avogadro's constant, think of apples and oranges. If you compare five apples to five oranges, you will find they have the same number but weigh differently. 
                        The weight of 5 oranges is different from the weight of 5 apples.
                        Similarly, one mole of iron (Fe) contains the same number of atoms as one mole of sodium (Na) (each contains 6.02 x 1023 atoms), but the mass of one mole of iron is 55.847 grams, and the mass of one mole of sodium is 23 grams

                        1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3
                        Lesson Summary

                            Redox reactions are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between species. During redox reactions, one species is reduced, and the other is oxidised.
                            Examples of redox reactions are iron rust, combustion reactions, and photosynthesis.
                            The oxidation number of an element is zero.
                            The reducing agent is an electron donor (reduces other species). It oxidises during a chemical reaction.
                            The oxidising agent is an electron acceptor (it oxidises other species). It reduces during a chemical reaction.
                            Redox reactions are divided into two types of reactions: oxidation and reduction reactions.
                            Oxidation increases the oxidation number of a species (more positive or less negative), and reduction makes the oxidation number less positive (or more negative).
                            Electrolysis is a chemical reaction influenced by a passing current.
                            An electrolysis cell is an electrochemical cell that uses an electric source to force a chemical reaction.
                            Electrochemical reactivity series is a list of elements arranged in order of decreasing their reactivity.
                            An electrolysis cell comprises two connected conductive electrodes (metal or carbon) immersed in an aqueous salt solution or molten salt.
                            The anode is connected to the positive pole of the electric source. Electrons are attracted to the anode.
                            In an electrolysis cell, the cathode is connected to the

                            By the end of this module, you will be able to:

                                Redox Equilibrium
                                When we submerge a copper rod in an aqueous solution of copper sulfate, a dynamic equilibrium is established in which the copper metal oxidises to copper ions, and some ions are reduced to metal copper.
                                Oxidation reaction
                                Copper metal is oxidised to copper ions.
                                                    Cu(s) → Cu2+ + 2e−
                                Reduction reaction
                                Copper ions are reduced to copper metal.
                                                    Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu(s)
                                There is an equilibrium between the oxidation and reduction reactions. We can write the oxidation-reduction reaction as follows:
                                                    Cu2+ (aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu (s)
                                Even though the Cu2+/Cu redox reaction is at equilibrium, the equilibrium is shifted more to the right when compared to reactive metals. Copper is an unreactive metal at the bottom of the electrochemical series; it easily gains electrons and reduces to copper metal.
                                An equilibrium redox reaction occurs between the copper metal and Cu²⁺ ions.

                        The Opposite Happens With Active Metals
                        When a zinc rod is submerged in an aqueous zinc sulfate solution, zinc metal loses electrons and converts to zinc ions; at the same time, zinc ions gain electrons and convert to zinc metal.

                                                                                               Zn2+ (aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn (s)

                        A conductive electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution is called a half-cell. For example, a copper electrode immersed in a copper sulfate solution is a half-cell.
                        We write the half-cell as Cu2+/Cu.
                        In the half-cell, a difference in potential develops at the interface between the copper ions and copper metal because of the difference in the oxidation states between the electrode and electrolyte; we call it “the electrode potential.”
                        ● The voltage measured under standard conditions for a half-cell using a standard hydrogen electrode is called the “standard electrode potential”. It has the symbol EꝊ (spoken of as E standard).
                        ● Standard conditions are
                          ▸ The concentration is 1.00 mol dm−3 for an aqueous ionic solution.
                          ▸ The temperature is at 25°C (298K).
                        Standard Electrode Potential of Some Half-Cells
                        Here are some examples of standard electrode potentials under standard conditions.
                        The positive voltage indicates that species are easily reduced, and the negative voltage means that species are easily oxidised.

                            The more negative the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is oxidised (the equilibrium lies further to the left).
                            The more positive the electrode potential, the more readily the metal is reduced (the equilibrium lies further to the right).

                        Notice that we consider the metals at the top of the reactivity series to be good reducing agents. This is because they are easily oxidised, releasing electrons and reducing other metals.
                        Measuring the Electrode Potential of a Half-Cell
                        Why don’t we measure the electrode potential directly without using a reference electrode?
                        We use a reference electrode (for example, a standard hydrogen electrode with a known potential) to measure the electrode potential of a half-cell. It is not possible to measure the electrode potential directly due to double-layer formation.

                        The double layer is a layer that forms when a metal electrode is dipped in an electrolyte; for example, a zinc electrode in a zinc sulfate electrolyte. Zinc tends to be oxidised to Zn2+ ions. As a result, the formed zinc ions move into the solution, causing the accumulation of electrons on the surface of the zinc electrode. The accumulated layer of electrons attracts Zn2+ ions in the solution, leaving another layer of positive ions near the surface of the electrode.
                        A double layer formation of negative electrons and positive ions.
                        Electrolysis (Concept Revisited)
                        In the first module, we used electric current to bring about a non-spontaneous redox reaction in an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis uses an electrochemical cell to deposit pure metal or collect non-metal gases under an imposed current.

                        Electrolysis
                        Connecting two electrochemical half-cells
                        The electrolytic cell consists of two electrodes immersed in a single electrolyte, where ions move between the two electrodes. Consequently, the positive anode is the electrode at which oxidation occurs, and the negative cathode is the electrode at which ions are reduced.
                        The electrolysis cell is connected to a power source (battery) to enforce a non-spontaneous redox reaction.
                        The reaction at the anode:
                                    X− → X + e−
                        The reaction at the cathode:

                        Galvanic Cells (Voltaic Cells)
                        Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells that use spontaneous redox reactions to produce electricity.
                        The galvanic cell components

                        The galvanic cell consists of two electrodes immersed in two separate electrolytes. We call the electrode immersed in its electrolyte a half-cell.
                        The two half-cells must be connected in air and solution for current to flow between them. We use a wire to connect the two electrodes (allowing the flow of electrons) and a tube filled with an electrolyte to bridge the two electrolytes (allowing the flow of ions). Typically, the wire is fitted with a voltmeter to measure the produced electricity (unit volt).
                        The galvanic or voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell in which spontaneous redox reactions produce electrical energy.
                        Galvanic Cells (Voltaic Cells) cont.
                        When we write electrochemical cell notation, we usually use the following order: the half-cell containing the anode ‖ the half-cell containing the cathode:
                                                                                   Cell notation: anode/aq ‖ aq/cathode
                        (We separate the two half-cells with a double vertical line ‖, which is the salt bridge symbol).
                        Notice
                        - In galvanic cells, ions discharge at the cathode while electrons discharge at the anode (the anode electrode is consumed).
                        - The electrolyte used in the salt bridge should be inert and not react with any of the two cells' components.
                        - We write anode/aq ‖ aq/cathode. In half-cells containing only ions, we write:
                        reduced anode/ oxidised anode ‖ oxidised cathode/ reduced cathode.

The two half-cells are connected in the air through a wire fitted with a voltmeter and a salt bridge to connect the two electrolytes. Notice that we used a copper electrode in the Cu2+/Cu half-cell and a zinc electrode in the Zn/Zn2+ half-cell.

                        From Eϴ values, we find that:
                           a. Silver ions are easier to reduce.
                           b. Zinc is easier to oxidise.
                           c. Zinc loses electrons, and silver accepts electrons.

                        When the two half-cells are connected, the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell is the positive electrode, and the Cu/Cu2+ half-cell is the negative electrode (less positive).
                        The reaction at the Fe3+/Fe2+ half-cell:

                        Both Eϴ values are positive. The smaller Eϴ value is the negative pole, and the larger Eϴ value is the positive electrode.

                        In the Mn2+/Mn ‖ Pb2+/Pb electrochemical cell, the Pb2+/Pb half-cell is the positive electrode (less negative), and the Mn2+/Mn half-cell is the negative electrode.
                        The reaction at the Mn/Mn2+ half-cell:

                        Since both Eϴ values are negative, we expect electrons to flow from the more negative Mn/Mn2+ half-cell towards the less negative Pb2+/Pb half-cell.

                        Using Eθ Values to Predict if a Reaction Will Occur
                        Predict if silver ions react with zinc metal.
                        We can predict if the Ag+ will be reduced when a zinc rod is placed in an aqueous silver solution by looking at their Eϴ values.
                        To compare, we need to look at the two electrode potentials of silver and zinc.
                        Ag+(aq) + e– ⇌ Ag(s)                Eϴ = +0.80V
                        Zn2+ (aq) + 2e– ⇌ Zn(s)           Eϴ = −0.76 V
                        From the Eϴ values, we deduce that zinc is a strong reducing agent (negative Eϴ value) and silver ions are good oxidising agents (positive Eϴ value).
                        Predict if Silver Ions React With Zinc Metal

                        If we place a zinc rod in an aqueous solution of silver, the following reaction takes place:
                        Zn(s) + 2Ag+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Ag(s)
                        Zinc is a stronger reducing agent, and silver is a stronger oxidising agent.
                        Zinc is a stronger reducing agent, and silver is a stronger oxidising agent.
                        Notice that for the reaction to happen, we need two arrows, one for oxidation and the other for reduction. The arrows have their heads reversed (form a circle).
                        No reaction occurs when placing a silver rod in an aqueous zinc solution because silver can’t reduce zinc ions.
                        The reaction doesn’t occur.
                        The Reaction Between Copper Solution and Zinc Rod
                        Predict if the reaction between copper solution and zinc rod is feasible
                        Similarly, we can use the Eϴ value to predict if a zinc rod will react with copper solution.

                        Zn2+ (aq) + 2e– ⇌ Zn(s)        Eϴ = −0.76 V
                        Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ⇌ Cu(s)         Eϴ = +0.34 V
                        The Eϴ value of zinc is less than that of copper; therefore, zinc acts as a reducing reagent, reducing copper ions to copper metal. If we place a zinc rod in an aqueous copper solution, a reaction happens between the zinc and copper ions.
                        The direction of the arrows forming a circle in the order of Zn, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cu.
                        The direction of the arrows forming a circle in the order of Zn, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cu.
                        The overall reaction is written as:
                                                                               Zn (s) + Cu2+ → Zn2+ + Cu (s)
                        Notice that the direction of the arrows is in the following order: zinc, zinc ions, copper ions, and copper. But if we reversed the arrows by placing a copper rod in an aqueous solution of zinc, no change would be observed.
                        Predict if Iron Oxide Reduces Chlorine Gas
                        If we looked at Eϴ values:
                                                                       Fe3+ + e– ⇋ Fe2+                Eϴ = + 0.77 V
                                                                       Cl2 + 2e– ⇌ 2Cl–                 Eϴ = +1.36 V
                        Fe2+ ions are more likely to lose electrons and convert to Fe3+ ions (smaller Eϴ value). By that, Fe2+ acts as a strong reducing agent that reduces chlorine gas into chloride ions. Combining the two half-equations:
                                                                                               Fe3+ + Cl2 → Fe2+ + 2Cl–
                        Chlorine is a strong oxidising agent; it is more likely to accept electrons. Notice the direction of the arrows:
                        The direction of iron redox reaction is from Fe2+ to Fe3+.

                        Lesson Summary

                            The equilibrium of redox reactions is shifted to the right for unreactive metals compared to reactive metals.
                            A half-cell consists of an electrode immersed in an electrolytic solution.
                            The difference in oxidation state between the electrode and the solution creates a potential difference.
                            The standard electrode potential EꝊ (spoken of as E standard) for a half-cell is at standard conditions (25oC, 1 mol dm−3, and 1 atm for gases).
                            The standard hydrogen electrode is used as a reference when measuring half-cell potential.
                            Standard hydrogen electrode has electrode potential EꝊ equal to zero.
                            The voltage measured under standard conditions using a standard hydrogen electrode serving as the other half-cell is the standard electrode potential for that half-cell (Eϴ) (E standard).
                            The more negative the electrode potential, the easier it is for the element to be oxidised. Moreover, the more positive the electrode potential, the easier it is to be reduced.
                            Due to the formation of double layers at the electrode, we measure the electrode potential using a reference electrode.
                            The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black and immersed in a diluted sulfuric solution (1.00 mol dm−3) while hydrogen gas is bubbled at one atm pressure.
                            Learning Outcomes
                            By the end of this module, you will be able to:
                                Describe the Nernst equation formula
                                Explain how to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions

                                List the advantages and limitations of hydrogen fuel cells
                                Nernst equation
                                We discussed earlier the electrode potential of cells under standard conditions (temperature is 25oC and concentration is 1.00 mol dm−3). The German scientist Walther Nernst developed an equation to calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions (at any given temperature or concentration).
                                Nernst equation formula:
                                Where
                                E is the electrode potential under non-standard conditions.
                                Eꝋ is the electrode potential under standard conditions.
                                R is the gas constant, 8.314 JK−1mol−1.
                                T is the temperature in Kelvin.
                                z is the number of electrons.
                                F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol−1).
                                [oxidised form] and [reduced form] are concentrations of oxidised and reduced form
                                Nernst formula at 25oC
                                If we substitute the RT/F with their values at 25oC and convert ln to log10, the formula becomes:
                                The value 0.059 which replaced RT/F is obtained by substituting the values with R = 8.314 J K−1 mol−1, T = 298 Kelvin, F = 96,500 C mol−1, and multiplying by 2.303 to convert ln (x) to log10 (x).

                                Determining the Feasibility of a Reaction
                                In the previous module, we studied how to predict the feasibility of a reaction based on the difference between the two half-cells being greater than 0.30 volts. Sometimes, even though the cell voltage is greater than the mentioned value, the reaction is too slow to be considered feasible.
                                Consider the following example of the reaction between the two half cells, 2H+/H2 and Zn2+/Zn.
                                                                        2H+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ H2(g)                        Eϴ = 0.00 V
                                                                        Zn2+ (aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)                      Eϴ = −0.76 V
                                The voltage of the cell = 0.00 − (−0.76) = 0.76 V.
                                Although theoretically, the cell voltage is greater than 0.30 volts, zinc is considered to lack reactivity when placed in water; the reaction is too slow to be considered.
                                Another consideration is the difference between industrial and standard conditions. A large deviation from standard conditions can prevent the reaction from occurring.
                                In industry, the rate of a reaction is more crucial than Eϴ prediction of the reaction’s feasibility. The rate of a reaction can be increased by raising the temperature, pressure (for gaseous reactants), reactant concentration (for dissolved reactants), surface area (for solid reactants), or by adding a catalyst.
                                Cells and Batteries
                                Batteries

                                An electric battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells and is often used to power portable electronic devices. A battery delivers a small direct current derived from redox reactions. Many small appliances, such as mobile phones, cameras, torches, peacemakers, and remote controls, use batteries with a range of voltages. The voltage of the batteries depends on the number of connected cells and the type of electrolytes used. Different types of batteries have different voltages.
                                Factors to consider when choosing a battery are the battery’s size, voltage, cost, function duration, and rechargeability.
                                Primary batteries (non−chargeable disposable batteries)
                                Solid-state batteries

                                Solid-state batteries often called “dry cells,” consist of an electrolyte as a paste. They have been improved in recent years to be smaller and to provide more power for a longer lifetime. They can either be disposa

                                (ln(x)= 2.303 log10 x)
                                Nernst formula for cells containing solids
                                The concentration of solids doesn’t change; therefore, at 25oC, the Nernst equation can be simplified to:

                        ylindrical Primary Batteries
                        Cylindrical batteries
                        Zinc-carbon battery
                        Zinc-carbon battery components 
                        Reaction at the anode & cathode
                        Cylindrical batteries deliver 1.5 V, where the redox reaction proceeds in one direction until all the reactants are depleted. The voltage of these batteries often drops over time.
                        In the early days, cylindrical batteries were often called “dry batteries” to indicate that they didn't contain a spillable electrolyte. The first cylindrical batteries developed were zinc-carbon batteries.
                        Button Primary Batteries

                        Button batteries offer an improvement over cylindrical batteries. The most common type has a metal anode, such as lithium or zinc, whereas MnO2, silver oxide, oxygen, carbon monofluoride, mercuric oxide, or copper oxide serve as the cathode. Different electrolytes are used for different loads (appliances). Some button batteries have alkaline or organic-based electrolytes. Others have a layer of solid lithium iodide that allows lithium ions (Li+) to diffuse from the cathode to the anode.
                        Button Primary Batteries - Example
                        Example lithium/iodine button cell
                        Lithium/iodine buttons are often used in electrochemical cells. Their anode is made of very reactive lithium metal with a high Eϴ and easily loses electrons. As a result, the lithium-iodine button cells have a high, constant voltage for a long time, a long shelf-life (some can last for over 15 years, such as those used in pacemakers), and are lightweight.
                        Reaction at the anode:
                                                                    Li+ + e− ⇋ Li                 Eϴ= −3.04V
                        Lithium is a very reactive metal; it is easily oxidised, releasing electrons at the anode.
                                                                ½ I2 (s) + e− ⇋ I− (aq)         Eϴ= +0.54
                        The cell voltage = 0.54 − (−3.04) = +3.58 V
                        Although we calculated the cell voltage to be 3.58 Volts, the actual cell voltage is about 2.8 volts because the used electrolyte is not at standard (not 1.00 mol dm−3).
                        Secondary Batteries (Rechargeable)
                        Rechargeable batteries
                        Although redox reactions are reversible reactions, in primary batteries, the reaction proceeds in one direction until all reactants are depleted and the voltage declines.
                        Rechargeable batteries are unlike the primary non-rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries undergo a reversible reaction by connecting the battery to an external electric source. The reaction is reversed when the two poles are connected, and the reactants are restored.
                        Although, in theory, all reactions in batteries are reversible, in primary batteries, once the discharge has happened some chemicals are no longer available to reverse the reaction.

                        Other Developed Batteries
                        b. Lithium-ion batteries
                        Nickel-cadmium cells are smaller than lead-acid cells. The issue with this type of battery is its low voltage and proclivity to discharge quickly.
                        Aluminium-air batteries are lightweight and have a higher voltage, but they are expensive and don’t act as secondary batteries because the aluminium rods must be replaced.

                        Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells
                        Hydrogen fuel cells are electrochemical cells that produce energy from the redox reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. They power rockets and space shuttles and are now used in some buses and cars.
                        Rather than using fossil fuels to power vehicles, hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells produce electricity through chemical reactions.
                        Hydrogen cell components
                        The hydrogen cell is connected to a compressed hydrogen gas supply that is stored in carbon fibre and fed into the cell. The oxygen fed from the other side is compressed air. Fuel cells are unique in that they produce electricity efficiently (energy per gram is higher than burning fuel) with only water as a by-product. Furthermore, because the energy is used directly, there is no need for moving parts, such as cars that run on fossil fuels.
                        Exercise:
                        Calculate the cell voltage of the following nickel-cadmium cell.
                                        Cd(OH)2 + 2e− → Cd + 2OH−                      EꝊ= −0.81V
                                   NiO2 + 2H2O + 2e− → Ni(OH)2 + 2OH−           EꝊ= +0.49V
                        If you know that this type of cell is rechargeable, describe the reactions when the cell is charged and recharged.
                        Hydrogen Cell Chemistry
                        Essentially, a hydrogen cell generates energy and water by combining hydrogen and oxygen.
                        Like any other electrochemical cell, a hydrogen cell consists of two platinum electrodes and an acid electrolyte. Typically, the two electrodes are made of porous platinum supported on carbon and separated with a membrane that allows ions to go through.
                        Reactions at the Negative and Positive Electrodes
                        Reaction at the negative electrode (anode)
                        Hydrogen gas oxidises by losing two electrons and forming water.
                                                                                         H2(g) → 2H+ (aq) + 2e−
                        The produced electrons flow through the external circuit used in the electric motor.
                        Reaction at the positive electrode (cathode)
                        The produced hydrogen ions at the anode diffuse through a membrane to the cathode, where they react with oxygen gas.
                                                                                        4H+ (aq) + O2 (g) + 4e− → 2H2O
                        At the cathode, oxygen gas is reduced, and water is released.
                        The overall reaction
                                                                                                 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
                        Lesson Summary

                            The Nernst equation relates the electrode potential to the temperature and concentration of an electrode.
                            The solid concentration doesn't change and is therefore cancelled when applying the Nernst equation.
                            Some reactions are too slow to consider even with a voltage difference greater than 0.30 volts.
                            An electric battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells and is often used to power portable electronic devices.
                            Different batteries have different voltages and electrolytes.
                            Primary batteries are non-chargeable, and secondary batteries are rechargeable.
                            Solid-state batteries contain pastes moistened with electrolytes.
                            Solid-state cylindrical primary batteries often contain an anode made of zinc and a cathode made of graphite, NH4Cl as an electrolyte in the form of a moist paste, and MnO2 paste, which acts as a polariser to prevent the build-up of hydrogen gas bubbles.
                            A thin paper layer separates the two electrodes in the dry cell to prevent an electrical short circuit.
                            A lead cap on each end of the dry battery connects the battery to the external electrical circuit.
                            Button batteries' anodes are often made of lithium or zinc, and some cathodes are of MnO2, silver oxide, oxygen, carbon monofluoride, mercuric oxide, or copper oxide.
                            Cell electrolytes differ according to different loads (appliances).

                                Machinery Introduction
                                Machines are an integral part of modern industry, making work easier for human operators. However, these machines also pose a significant risk to workers if not properly safeguarded. The fast-moving parts, sharp edges, and high-powered mechanisms of machines can cause severe injuries like amputations, lacerations, crushing, abrasions, and even fatalities. This is why machine safeguarding is so important - it ensures that workers can do their jobs safely and helps prevent costly accidents and downtime. To understand how to safeguard machines, let's first understand what exactly machines are and the hazards they can present.
                                What is a machine or machinery?

                                As per ISO 12100, an international standard on machinery safety, a machine is defined as "An assembly fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves and which are joined together for a specific application." 
                                This highlights the fact that the presence of moving parts is the key characteristic that defines a machine, and it is these moving parts that can create the primary hazards.
                                What is a hazard?
                                Machinery Hazards
                                Machinery hazards can be grouped into two main categories:
                                Mechanical Hazards
                                Mechanical hazards can come from the movement of various mechanical parts such as gears, moving belts & pulleys, rotating shafts, reciprocating arms, cutting teeth, or any other parts that are in motion. These different types of hazardous mechanical
                                Mechanical Hazards
                                There is a risk of injury whenever a machine part moves or has the potential to move. Movements can be reciprocating, sliding/transverse, or rotational. Each form of movement poses a different hazard, including one or more of the following:
                                Abrasion (or Friction)
                                This is the result of friction between a moving part and the skin. The risk increases with the surface's roughness and speed of movement. Even smooth parts can cause abrasion if they are moving at high speeds. The risk may increase if the body part is trapped and unable to escape the hazard.
                                Cutting (or Severing)
                                Crushing (or Pinching) parts are found in various combinations in all machines. 
                                Non-mechanical Hazards
                                e additional protection.
                                Mechanical Hazards (Cont.)
                                Drawing in (or Trapping)
                                This is caused when a body part is drawn into a 'nip point' of the moving machine parts. The risk is more significant if the surface is rough or has projections, e.g., screws and bolts. The injury may occur as a direct result of the entanglement or as a result of the body part being dragged into an area where further injuries could occur. Anyone with long hair, loose clothing, gloves, a necktie, jewelry, or any of these things is at considerably higher risk.
                                Impact (or Struck by)
                                Stabbing (or Puncture)
                                Shearing (or Chopping)
                                Risk Control of Machinery Hazards
                                To ensure the safe operation of machines, it is necessary to control the risks posed by machinery hazards. Controlling the risks involves identifying the hazards, assessing the risk level presented by each hazard, and implementing suitable control measures. This approach can be implemented at any stage of the machinery's lifespan, from construction to disposal, and should be repeated until the risk is deemed acceptable.
                                Hazard Identification
                                Machinery hazards that have not been identified can neither be assessed nor managed. The risk control process, therefore, starts with an inspection of the machine operation and its operating parts to identify the hazards present.  This includes checking for all hazardous conditions and predicting any hazardous events associated with the machine. Using a checklist or template can simplify the process, but hazard identification can effectively be accomplished by following these four steps.
                                Analysis of operation
                                Analysis of machine
                                Analysis of current controls
                                Machine intervention analysis
                                This involves observing work activities associated with the machine and recognizing the hazards to which workers may be exposed. In addition to normal operation, these activities may include start-up, shut-down, cleaning, tool changes, common maintenance, etc.
                                When identifying hazards, it is also essential to consider any past accidents, incidents, or malfunctions, as well as relevant regulations, standards, technical specifications, and safety data sheets.
                                Risk Assessment
                                After identifying the machinery hazards, the next step is to assess their risk level and prioritize them accordingly. There are a variety of methods for conducting risk assessments, ranging from technical (quantitative risk assessment) to observational (qualitative risk assessment). A simplified model presented here includes elements of both quantitative and qualitative methods and comprises two steps: Risk Estimation and Risk Evaluation.
                                In risk estimation, the risk level for each hazardous situation is estimated by quantifying the following elements of risk:
                                A) Severity of harm, which can be determined based on the extent of injury or health damage, such as minor, major, or fatal, and the number of people affected, such as one or multiple.
                                B) Probability of occurrence, which is determined by the likelihood of a hazardous event happening and the availability of technical and human measures to prevent or mitigate harm
                                Risk Assessment (Cont.)
                                After assigning the appropriate values for severity and probability, the Overall Risk Score (also referred to as the Risk Index Value) is calculated by multiplying the severity and probability values.
                                Overall Risk Score = Severity x Probability
                                The overall risk score for each identified hazard is then used to evaluate the level of risk and determine if it is acceptable. If deemed unacceptable, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented.
                                The scores can also be used to prioritize risks, with higher scores signifying a greater degree of risk requiring more focus and mitigation resources.

                                You can learn more about the machinery risk assessment procedure by referring to "ISO 12100:2010. standard,  Safety of machinery — General principles for design — Risk assessment and risk reduction".
                                ontrol Measures
                                If the risk assessment process determines that a reduction in risk is necessary, appropriate control measures are selected and implemented. For selecting control measures, the following hierarchy of controls is used to reduce risk levels.
                                Inherently Safe Design Measures
                                Inherently safe design measures involve eliminating hazards or reducing associated risks through the selection of appropriate design features in the machinery. This is the most effective and ideal solution for reducing risk, as design elements that naturally eliminate or reduce hazards are likely to remain effective, whereas other protective measures can sometimes fail or be ignored. There are two approaches to designing machines with inherent safety.
                                Avoiding or Reducing Hazards
                                Examples of this approach include:
                                — Reducing the mass, speed, or distances of travel of moving parts.
                                — Ensuring rotating parts have no projections and smooth polished surfaces.
                                — Reducing the sharpness and increasing the corner radii of machinery parts.
                                — Increasing the separation and clearance distances between moving parts.
                                — Filling or reducing the size of gaps to prevent access to crushing or shearing hazards.
                                — Reducing operating temperatures and pressures.
                                Machine Safeguards
                                Due to operational limitations, it may not always be possible to reduce risk to an acceptable level by using inherently safe design measures. In such cases, machine safeguards become the next option.
                                It's common to use the words "safeguard" and "guard" interchangeably, but they have distinct definitions in the field of machinery safety.
                                What are machine "safeguards"?
                                The word "safeguards" refers to a collection of protective measures used to keep workers from coming into potentially dangerous contact with machinery hazards Those protective measures can be machine guards or safeguarding devices employed separately or in combination.

                                Machine Safeguards (Cont.)
                                What are "safeguarding devices"?
                                For a better understanding, the next page provides the categorization of machine safeguards.

                                Reducing Access to Hazards
                                Administrative Controls & PPE
                                Personal protective equipment (PPE) and administrative controls are viewed as last resort for managing risks associated with machinery hazards. They aim to reduce residual risks after higher-level controls, which address the hazard at its source. Also, these controls require substantial efforts and oversight to be effective and potentially less effective than other risk control methods.
                                Administrative Controls
                                Administrative controls involve implementing procedures and processes to reduce risk by establishing a set of required actions. This can include placing warning signs on machines, having documented safe operating procedures, training workers, lock-out tag-out machines before interventions, etc. 
                                Personal Protective Equipment
                                Machine Guards
                                A machine guard is a physical barrier or cover that is designed to prevent access to machinery hazards. There are several types of machine guards, each designed for a specific purpose. General categorization is as follows:
                                Fixed Guards
                                These guards are fixed permanently (through welding or riveting) or temporarily (by screws, nuts, etc.) and can only be opened or removed with the use of tools or by destroying the attachment mechanism. There are two basic types:
                                Enclosing Guards
                                These guards block access to the danger zone from all sides and cannot be easily removed. However, if frequent access is required, access sections are created along with the use of suitable interlocks. They are typically made from meshed material such as wire mesh, perforated metal, or other similar materials, which allows visibility to the machine. However, if noise, dust, and ejected material protection are also required, solid enclosing guards are used.
                                Distance Guards
                                Note: Enclosing guards provide greater access protection than distance guards.
                                Moveable Guards
                                The movable guards remain attached to the machine through hinges or slides and can be opened easily without any special tool. There are three basic types:
                                Adjustable Guards
                                These guards can be adjusted in position or have sections that can be adjusted in position. These are typically secured with tighteners, like wing nuts, that can be tightened or loosened quickly. Adjustable guards are frequently seen on tools like circular saws and pillar drills; however, their effectiveness depends on the user maintaining the correct guard setting. Because of this, adjustable guards should only be used when a fixed or interlocking guard is not feasible.
                                Self-adjusting Guards
                                Interlocking Guards With Guard Locking
                                For some machinery, the moving parts may have high momentum and take a significant time to stop, or the machine may be programmed to finish a cycle before stopping. In these situations, a standard interlocking guard may not be enough, and a guard-locking feature may be necessary. The guard-locking feature includes a latching device that prevents the guard from being opened until the latch is opened. There are two types:
                                Interlocking guard with unconditional unlocking
                                In this case, the operator must unlock the latch before the guard can be opened. This typically requires the operator to activate an “unlocking” control on the machine control panel and provides for a certain time delay between activating the “stop” control and opening the guard.
                                Interlocking guard with conditional unlocking
                                Other Types
                                Interlocking Guards With Trapped Key
                                Trapped key interlocking guards ensure that the guard is always closed and locked before the machine can be activated. They work by using a key system to control access to the dangerous parts of the machine and to activate its start function. The key must be inserted into the guard control in order to open the guard and gain access to the dangerous parts. Once the guard is open, the key is trapped in the guard control and cannot be removed until the guard is closed and locked again. Similarly, the same key must be inserted into the start control in order to activate the machine, and it is trapped in the control until the machine is stopped.
                                Interlocking Control Guards
                                Note: If there is a possibility that someone could become trapped inside the guarded area, then it is necessary to have a presence-sensing device and emergency stop feature available inside the area.
                                Machine Guards Design Requirements
                                When determining the appropriate design and type of machine guards, a comprehensive evaluation of all foreseeable aspects of the machinery's environment and operation during its expected lifespan is crucial. This includes considering the potential dangers posed by the various hazards present and the groups of individuals who may be exposed to these hazards. Inadequate evaluation of these aspects can lead to hazardous situations, such as individuals being able to bypass the guards and exposing themselves to danger.

                                The aspects to take into account include the following:
                                    Machine aspects
                                    Human aspects
                                    Materials of construction
                                    Shape and installation aspects
                                Let's delve into the elements that should be considered for each aspect.
                                Machine Aspects
                                Access to dangerous parts of the machine
                                Machine guards should be designed in a way that doesn't require opening or removing them to make adjustments, lubrication, and routine maintenance of the machine. This can be achieved by installing multiple smaller guards that prevent access to dangerous parts while allowing access to safe parts. Also, small access holes can be provided for screwdrivers, test probes, etc. 
                                Ejected materials and hazardous substances
                                Noise Level
                                Radiation
                                Explosive atmosphere

                            uman Aspects
                            Ergonomic aspects
                            Machine guards may need to be moved or removed at some point; therefore, they should be designed with manual handling in mind, taking into account factors such as size, weight, etc. Sliding guards or doors should be easy to open and not require excessive force. Where guards are too heavy to be moved manually, suitable lifting provisions must be available on the guards.
                            Viewing the process
                            Safety distances
                            Materials of Construction
                            Rigidity and durability
                            It is essential to select and arrange machine guarding components such as support posts, guard frames, mountings, and infill materials in a way that creates a stable, rigid structure able to resist deformation. This is particularly crucial in areas where deformation could compromise the necessary safety distances around the machinery.
                            Impact and ejection resistance
                            Resistance to corrosion
                            Non-toxicity
                            Electrostatic properties
                            Color and appearance
                            Shape and Installation Aspects
                            Crushing or trapping points
                            It is important to make sure that the guards do not create any hazardous crushing or trapping points with other parts of the machine or other guards. This means that the guards should be positioned and shaped in a way that prevents workers from getting caught or compressed between them and other parts of the machinery.
                            Hygiene and cleaning
                            Sharp edges
                            Integrity of joints
                            Removal and mounting
                            Dimensions of Distance Guards
                            When using distance guards instead of enclosing guards to prevent access, it is crucial to ensure that they are of the appropriate size. The recommended approach is summarized below, but for more in-depth guidance, you can consult ISO 13857:2019, which addresses the safety of machinery and the required safety distances to keep hazard zones out of reach of upper and lower limbs.
                            Perimeter Guards
                            Perimeter guards should have a minimum height of 1 meter to prevent individuals from climbing over them. However, the height of the guard (b) may have to be up to 2.5 meters, depending on the height of the danger zone (a) and the horizontal distance to it (c). If portable steps or ladders, or other machines are present in the area, the height of the guard should be increased. If it is challenging to raise the height of the guard, then an enclosing guard may be more ap

                            Reaching Through Openings
                            Machine guards may have holes, slots, and other openings for specific purposes, such as feeding raw material, removing finished products, and viewing the process. These openings must be small enough (and a sufficient distance away from the danger zone) to prevent access to dangerous parts. The closer the opening is to the danger zone, the smaller it will need to be to prevent access. The ISO 13857:2019 standard provides guidance on the safe distances required to prevent access to hazard zones by upper and lower limbs. Here are some examples based on the standard:
                            Finger Entry
                            Hand Entry
                            Arm Entry
                            If a round-shaped opening (A) has a diameter of 8 - 10 mm, the opening should be located 20 mm or more from the dangerous parts to prevent finger entry access.
                            Interlocking Devices
                            Interlocking devices aim to stop a machine's hazardous operations under a specific condition, such as by opening a machine guard. These devices monitor the guard's position and send a stop command if it's not closed. They can also control other functions, like applying a brake to stop hazardous machine operations before access is allowed. 
                            There are various types, but they mainly fall into two categories based on their actuation principle:
                            1. Mechanically activated devices
                            The principle of working for these types of devices is based on physical contact, force, or pressure. They use switching cams, turning levers, or hinges to activate or deactivate the machine. To increase safety, some of these devices may be coded, which means that they can only be operated with a specific actuator, such as a key or a specific shape. 
                            2. Non-mechanically activated devices
                            Examples of interlocking devices are shown on the following page
                            Interlocking Device Examples
                            Linear Cam-operated Position Detector
                            This type uses a linear cam to open or close a control circuit by means of an actuator & position detector. It is commonly used on sliding guards to detect when the guard is opened or closed. The linear cam is connected to the sliding guard, and when the guard is opened, it forces the actuator down, which in turn opens the control circuit contacts and deactivates the machinery. 
                            Rotary Cam-operated Position Detector
                            Tongue-operated Interlocking Device
                            Interlocking Device Examples (Cont.)
                            Lever-operated Interlocking Device
                            In this type, an open guard physically blocks the start/stop lever, preventing it from being lifted to start the machine. The machine may be started once the guard is closed, enabling the lever to be lifted.
                            Captive-key interlocking Device
                            Non-contact interlocking Devices

                            Mode of Actuation
                            Mode of actuation refers to the method or mechanism by which a device is activated or triggered to operate. Selecting the appropriate mode of actuation is crucial for interlocking devices to minimize the risk of manipulation. Mechanically activated interlocks can be triggered in two ways: positive-mode actuation and negative-mode actuation.
                            Positive-mode Actuation
                            Negative-mode Actuation
                            This actuation works by keeping the plunger of the interlocking device pressed down by a cam, resulting in an open circuit as long as the guard stays open. Once the guard is fully closed, a spring moves the plunger back, completing the circuit. In case of a fault, such as the spring failure, the device will fail to a safe condition, and the machine will not operate.
                            Positive-mode actuation is more reliable than negative mode. Therefore, when a guard employs a single mechanical interlock, it should utilize positive-mode actuation. Interlocks with negative-mode actuation should only be used in combination with additional positive-mode actuators on the same guard.
                            Interlocking System Failures
                            Even though interlocking systems effectively prevent access to dangerous parts, injuries still happen on machines with these types of systems. The reasons for failure can be divided into two categories:
                            Interlock Malfunction
                            Commonly occurring faults with interlock systems can include misaligned parts, sticking of moving parts, poor electrical connections, short-circuiting, spring fractures, and corrosion. These faults are often caused by vibration, wear, and the accumulation of dust and liquids that have not been adequately addressed in the design or by routine maintenance.
                            Interlock Defeat
                            How to Avoid Interlock Failures?
                            Ensuring safe operation and preventing interlock failures requires the use of reliable, high-quality, and high safety-rated devices that are difficult to bypass. Additionally, the following suggestions can be implemented to avoid failures:
                            Avoiding Interlock Malfunction
                            Interlock malfunction can be prevented or reduced by:
                            — Choosing an interlocking system with high reliability of control system; 
                            — Installing interlocks securely, so they do not move during use and do not come loose;
                            — Protecting components and wiring from physical damage;
                            — If using mechanically activated interlocks, choose those with positive-mode actuation;
                            — Preventing the use of interlock devices as the standard machine stop;
                            — Ensuring regular maintenance, testing, and training of personnel.
                            Avoiding Interlock Defeat
                            Presence Sensing Devices
                            Presence Sensing Devices (also known as Trip Devices) do not restrict access to the danger zone but rather stop the movement of potentially hazardous parts before contact. While these devices offer adequate protection, they are unsuitable in situations where the ejection of machine parts or materials is possible or containment of dangerous emissions (e.g., noise, dust) is necessary. Additionally, if the machine has a slow or inconsistent stop time or is unable to stop mid-cycle during operation, these devices are also inappropriate.
                            The main types of presence-sensing devices are:

                                Light Curtains
                                Area Scanning Devices
                                Pressure Mats
                                Pressure Sensitive Edges and Bars
                                Trip Switches

                            Light Curtains
                            Light curtains (also called light guards) are electronic devices that consist of a light emitter and a light receiver. The emitter transmits visible or invisible (such as infrared) light beams, and the receiver detects them. If any of the light beams is blocked, the machine stops. 
                            Advantages
                            Limitations
                            Installation
                            Light curtains minimize the requirement for interlocking guards and give nearly transparent access to machinery. This is especially advantageous for automated machinery moving bulk goods or machinery where regular access for loading or unloading is required.

                            Area Scanning Devices
                            Area scanning devices use harmless electromagnetic radiation, usually laser beams, to detect movement or changes within the defined area. When a movement or change is detected, it sends a stop signal to the machine and shuts it down. 
                            Advantages
                            Limitations
                            Installation
                            Laser scanning devices typically have a fast response time and can quickly detect objects and shut down machinery. They can cover a wide area, making them useful for protecting large machines or multiple machines at once. Their applications include detecting personnel in front of unmanned guided vehicles and within perimeter guards, e.g., in robotic machine enclosures.
                            Protective Devices
                            In some cases, it may be necessary to perform maintenance or repairs on a machine while the guarding interlocks are disabled. These kinds of interventions are extremely risky and should be avoided if at all possible. Additional control measures, usually involving the use of protective devices, are required if the suspension of interlocks cannot be avoided. Protective devices allow machine parts to move but in a way that reduces the risk to the machine operator. Also, protective devices can offer some degree of protection if a machine is difficult to guard due to its operational requirements. There are two basic approaches:
                            1. Reduce access to the danger zone
                            This is achieved using Two-Hand Devices and/or Hold-to-Run Devices. These devices allow machine parts to move but only while control is being operated by someone who is a safe distance away from the danger zone.
                            2. Reduce the hazard in the danger zone
                            Two-hand Controls
                            Two-hand control devices require an operator to use both hands simultaneously to actuate two separate controls to start a machine. This functionality is typically applied where the operator needs to be very close to the machine and could place his other hand in the danger zone if it was a one-handed control.
                            Advantages
                            Limitations
                            Installation
                            Two-hand controls are an option for machinery that is otherwise hard to guard (e.g., machines having feed and removal processes). This protective device forces the operator to remain in a designated safe area while operating the machine. The operator must keep both controls engaged to activate the machinery; if one control is released, the machine will stop.
                            -to-run Controls
                            Devices with hold-to-run operation require an operator to continuously actuate a control to initiate and maintain the operation of the machine. The control can be in the form of a button or lever, which upon release, stops the machine.
                            Advantages
                            Limitations
                            Installation
                            Hold-to-run controls are typically installed at a safe distance from hazardous areas. These devices require the operator to be positioned away from the danger zone in order to operate the machine by continuously pressing the control. Hold-to-run controls are also used on small power tools such as portable drill machines, where they function as an emergency stop mechanism rather than providing safety by distance.
                            Safe Distance Calculation
                            A protective device's effectiveness depends on its location being far enough from the machine's danger zone. This is because moving parts of the machine do not come to an immediate stop, and if someone can reach the danger zone before the machine stops, it could result in injury.
                            Safe Distance (S)
                            Approach Speed (K)
                            Total Stopping Time (T)
                            Additional Distance (C)
                            The safe distance to install protective devices "S" can be derived using the following formula, as specified by "ISO 13855:2010 Safety of machinery — Positioning of safeguards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body".
                            S = (K x T) + C
                            The same formula can also be applied to other types of safeguards, including interlocked guards, light curtains, pressure-sensitive mats, area scanning devices, etc.
                            Limited Operation Devices
                            Limited operation devices reduce the inherent hazard in the machine by reducing the speed, or range of movement, of machine parts. While this is beneficial, the risk can rarely be reduced to such a low level that access to the moving parts can be acceptable. Usually, access still needs to be prevented, and because these devices do not prevent access, additional functionality (e.g., hold-to-run or two-hand devices) needs to be provided.
                            Speed Limiting Devices
                            These devices provide workers with additional time to avoid an accident by reducing the movement speed of potentially dangerous parts. This feature is useful during machine maintenance or adjustments, promoting a controlled machinery operation. Some machines include a built-in speed limiter that an authorized user with a key or combination can activate.
                            Movement Limiting Devices
                            Emergency Stop Systems
                            An emergency condition in a machine can arise unexpectedly and requires immediate action to prevent injury or damage. Emergency stop systems, also known as E-stops, provide a means for quickly shutting down machinery or equipment in the event of an emergency. 
                            Advantages
                            Limitations
                            Installation
                            When an emergency occurs, it is usually because of something that was not anticipated during the design stage of the machinery. Thus there may not be any built-in features or safeguards to mitigate its effects. In this situation, emergency stop devices provide a means for stopping the machinery in a safe and controlled manner.
                            Types of Emergency Stop Actuators
                            When used promptly, emergency stop devices can avoid or considerably reduce the severity of injuries. However, using the right type of actuator is essential to ensure prompt activation. The following are the main types of emergency stop actuators.
                            Push buttons
                            Wires and Ropes
                            Handles
                            Foot Pedals
                            These mushroom-head buttons are the most common type of emergency stop actuators and can be found on the control panels of the majority of machines. These actuators are easy to use, activate by pressing, and have a latching mechanism that keeps the switch in the "off" position until reset manually. The resetting process involves twisting the button in the direction indicated by arrows on the button.
                            Span of Control of E-Stops
                            The span of control refers to the number of machines or machine sections that a single emergency stop device can control. The most common approach is to have a single control that stops the entire machine. However, for larger and more complex equipment, other options are available, but they come with additional risks. These options are:
                            Zone Approach
                            Large and complex equipment can be divided into distinct "emergency stop zones" where activating the emergency stop in one zone only affects that specific zone while the others continue to operate normally. If this approach is used, it is crucial to clearly label and educate personnel on the designated zones.

                                    Introduction to NFPA
                                    The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is an international nonprofit organization based in the USA. The core purposes of NFPA include the eradication of death, economic loss, injuries, and loss of property that happen due to fire and its related hazards (e.g. electrical hazards). In order to introduce and maintain uniformity in the fire protection standards across the world, NFPA publishes various standards. 
                                    Some of the prominent examples of these standards include:
                                        NFPA 1, Fire Code
                                        NFPA 37, Standard for the Installation and Use of Stationary Combustion Engines and Gas Turbines
                                        NFPA 55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code, etc.
                                        NFPA 87, Standard for Fluid Heaters
                                        NFPA 97, Standard Glossary of Terms Relating to Chimneys, Vents,  and Heat-Producing Appliances
                                    More than 300 codes and standards have been published by NFPA to date. Among these, probably the most famous is NFPA 70, the National Electrical Code. NFPA 70 also continues a series of standards mentioned on the next page. 

                                The NFPA 70 Series
                                As mentioned earlier, the NFPA 70 series comprises a family of standards. There are three standards included in this series.  
                                The NFPA 70E
                                NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, is part of the NFPA 70 family. In this course, you will learn about this standard, especially its 2024 update.
                                The standard covers electrical safety requirements for employees. It primarily focuses on safeguards that ensure workers' productivity and safety from electrical hazards simultaneously. The specific requirements of this standard pertain to the following:

                                    Conductors connecting electrical installations with an electrical supply and
                                    Electrical equipment and conductors are present on (or within) the buildings or recreational vehicles, mobile homes, and other similar premises, such as industrial substations, carnivals, parking lots, yards, etc. 

                                What is Not Covered by NFPA 70E?
                                NFPA 70E does not cover electrical installations present in communications, auto vehicles, aircraft, marine vehicles, and electrical utilities. 
                                Key Principles of NFPA 70E
                                The key principles of NFPA 70E are related to:

                                    Procedures from JSA/JHA/AHA regarding shock protection boundaries.
                                    Lockout-Tagout

                                    Industrial best practices: Changes made in the standard reflect advancements in the electrical industry's safety protocol. By complying with the requirements, employers show their commitment to these best practices. 
                                    Technological advancements: Recent changes made in NFPA consider the technological advancements and allow employers to stay aligned with the safety protocols associated with the new techno
                                    NFPA 70E and Its Effects on Employers
                                    Since 2009, updated versions of NFPA 70E have been released every three years. These changes mean employers should be ready to make several changes in their approaches to electrical safety in their workplaces every now and then. That being said, let us first look at areas where the recent upgrades of NFPA 70E impact employers.
                                        Risk assessment: Employers must recognize electrical dangers, gauge their likelihood and seriousness, and decide whether further safety precautions, such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), are necessary.
                                        Arc flash: In order to establish suitable shock and arc flash boundaries and personal protective equipment, employers must assess shock and arc flash hazards.
                                        Training and qualification: Employers are in charge of assigning competent workers and training staff members who may be exposed to electrical hazards.
                                        Electrical safety program: Employers are required to create and carry out a program that addresses PPE, staff training, worker duties, electrical dangers, and safety-related work practices.

                                NFPA 70E and its Effects on Employers - (B)
                                This page continues an explanation of the responsibilities of employers after the recent update in NFPA 70E.
                                NFPA 70E and Audits
                                With updates every three years, employers implementing NFPA 70E will need to audit their electrical safety practices often. The two major areas requiring these audits will be 1) electrical safety documentation and work practices and 2) electrical-specific fieldwork.
                                Auditing Electrical-Specific Fieldwork
                                Auditing electrical-specific fieldwork means conducting an annual (internal or third-party) audit regarding the application of the electrical safety program.
                                Auditing Electrical Safety Documentation and Work-Related Practices

                                    Making constant updates in the written electrical safety program. One such requirement is specific to NFPA 70E (2024). It mentions completing a gap analysis of the existing documentation and fulfilling any gaps by updating these documents.
                                    Performing an internal OR third-party audit of the written electrical safety program. The interval between these audits should not exceed more than three years, as this will prevent getting aligned with the new editions of NFPA 70E.

                                    Maintenance of electrical equipment: Employers are legally required to create and execute an electrical maintenance program that adheres to the NFPA 70E standard and guarantees routine electrical equipment maintenance and inspections to avoid mishaps.
                                    Compliance with legal and regulatory authorities: Employers are required by OSHA and NFPA 70E to safeguard employees from electrical risks.
                                    Investigation of incidents: Employers must look into every electrical incident, even near misses, identify why they happened, and take corrective steps to keep such events from recurring in the future.

                                NFPA 70E and Audits - (B)
                                Auditing Electrical Safety Documentation and Work-Related Practices - Continued
                                These audits will also be performed to ensure that:

                                    Electrical safety work practices are regularly updated, and
                                    All arc flash and shock PPE, equipment, and tools have been assessed with their conditions documented. If any of these items require replacement or repair, it should be performed immediately.

                                What is Arc Flash?
                                An arc flash is a phenomenon in which an electric curr
                                OSHA and NFPA 70E
                                The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates the implementation of safety-related work practices by employers to reduce workplace fatalities and injuries from arc explosions and flash electrical shock,  electrocution, shock, and other injuries occurring from direct or indirect electrical contact.
                                In this regard, the NFPA 70E standard was developed at OSHA's request. As mentioned earlier, the standard aims to reduce the workplace hazards associated with electrical injuries. It applies to the employees who work on (or near) the exposed circuit parts or energized electrical conductors. These workers can include:

                                    Electricians
                                    Linemen
                                    Operators
                                    Electrical maintenance personnel
                                    Troubleshooters, site safety personnel, and
                                    Anyone exposed to energized equipment greater than 50 V.

                                Employers should train their qualified and non-qualified personnel, such as janitorial staff and maintenance personnel, to work directly with (or near) the electrical equipment on the NFPA 70E standard. 
                                ent flashes over the course and moves through the air between two conductors or toward the ground. The outcomes are frequently severe, and if a person is near an arc flash, they may suffer fatal injuries. Arc flash can happen for multiple reasons, such as condensation, dust in the environment, faulty installation, material failure, accidental touching, etc. 
                                The Important NFPA 70E Requirements - B
                                This page continues explaining some of the most important requirements of  NFPA 70 standard:

                                    NFPA 70E 110.2.D.3 requires employees to be retained in safety-related work practices within an interval of three years or less.
                                    NFPA 70E 120.2: This article requires employers to identify, document, and implement lockout-tagout procedures used to protect employees from electrical hazards. All procedures must be appropriate according to workplace training and conditions.
                                    NFPA 70E 130.5: It requires completing an arc flash assessment to determine the presence of an arc flash hazard. In this regard, the assessment will consider the following: 

                                1. Design of overcurrent protective device.
                                2. Its opening time, and
                                3. Its maintenance condition
                                If any major modification or renovation has been done, then the arc flash assessment must be updated. Also, the assessment's review intervals should not exceed five years.
                                "Shock" and "Electric Shock"
                                In this topic and the one following it, we will look at some of the major changes introduced in the 2024 edition and were not present in its predecessor, the 2021 edition. Please note that these changes are not discussed in great detail. Instead, we will try to understand how these recent changes have removed any previous issues with clarity or how the clauses have been made more specific. By going through these topics, you will understand the specific language used in regulations, especially in NFPA standards. This will provide you with a solid foundation upon which you can build your career further.  
                                First off, the term "shock" has seen an addition as the word "Electric" has been placed before it. So now, shock will be referred to as Electric Shock. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. In discussing 

                                    Hearing protection boundary, and
                                    Lung protection boundary

                                The term shock refers to shockwave. Examples of the term Electric Shock used in NFPA 70E can be seen in 130.4. In the 2021 standard, requirement 130.4 was called Shock Risk Assessment. However, in the 2024 edition, this has been changed to 130.4 Electric Shock Risk Assessment. The term Electric Shock appears sixty-three times in the whole standard. 
                                Introduction of Scopes
                                The 2024 update in NFPA 70E also made a significant change by introducing scopes to eleven articles. These articles are:

                                    110
                                    120
                                    130
                                    205
                                    210
                                    215

                                    225
                                    230
                                    240
                                    245
                                    250

                                Now, the scope of every article is indicated as .1. For example, the scope of Article 110 would be indicat
                                Changes in Article 90
                                This page compares Article 90 from NFPA 2021 and NFPA 2024.  
                                NFPA 2021	NFPA 2024
                                90.1 - Purpose	90.1 - Scope
                                90.2 - Scope	90.2 - Purpose
                                90.3 - Standard arrangement 	90.3 - Workplaces covered and not covered
                                90.4 - Mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials	90.4 - Standard arrangement 
                                Article 90 in NFPA 2024 also contains 90.5, which covers requirements for mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials. Thus, Article 90inNFPA2024 has an extra clause, i.e., 90.3 - Workplaces covered and not
                                90.5 - Explanatory Materials
                                As seen on the previous page, 90.5(c) contains requirements for mandatory rules, permissive rules, and explanatory materials. Here, we will look at the example of this explanatory material.
                                So, for instance, 90.5(C) of NFPA 70E 2024 says that references made to the standard will be linked with the latest standard unless a date is specified. For example, Information Note No. 2 to table 130.7(c)(15)(a) references Table 1 of IEEE 1584. Now, here, we are not being told about which year's standard we should look into for Table 1 of IEEE 1584. This can lead to confusion, as this table is present in both the 2002 and 2018 versions. 
                                However, according to 90.5(c), we will look for Table 1 in the 2018 NFPA standard since it is the latest one.   
                                Changes in Placement of Definitions
                                Previously, definitions were presented as two articles. For example, definitions related to Artticle 300 were present in 300.2, and definitions of Artticle 360 were present in 360.2. However, all the definitions have been moved to Article 100 altogether.
                                Also, if an article number in parentheses, such as (310), is mentioned after a definition, then this means that the definition is specific to that article only. We will take a deeper look at it on the next page.
                                Changes in Placement of Definitions - continued
                                Consider the definition of the term "Battery  Effect.' Previously, the term would be defined under the notion of 310.2 as:
                                A voltage exists on the cell line after the power supply is disconnected. 
                                Now, the definition has been moved to Article 100. However, since it is unique to Article 310 only, the definition contains the article number ahead of it in parenthesis. This way, the definition will look as follows:
                                A voltage exists on the electrolytic cell line after the power supply is disconnected. (310)
                                Notice that in the 2024 NFPA 70E edition, the word "electrolytic" has also been included in the definition. 
                                We have already mentioned about the structural reorganization of NFPA 2024. The 2018 version of NFPA 70E was expanded in different sections. However, the 2024 version has been consolidated. To understand this better, we will take an example of Article 110.
                                Article 110 and Reorganization
                                The first major change in Article 110 is the addition of scope. As mentioned previously, the scope is indicated by adding .1 ahead of the Article number. So, the scope of Article 110 will be mentioned as follows:
                                110.1: This article covers the general requirements for electrical safety-related workplaces.
                                110.2(A) Policy: According to this article, employers are required to establish, document, and implement an electrically safe work condition policy. This policy should do the following:

                                    Make hazard elimination the first priority., and
                                    Show compliance with Article 110.2 (B) whenever required. 

                                We have talked about consolidation in NFPA 2024  earlier. In this case, the consolidation has been done as follows:

                                    From 2021, 110.1 Priority and 110.5(K) Electrically Safe Work Condition Policy have been merged into 110.2 (A) Policy.
                                    From 2021, 110.3 Electrically Safe Work Condition and 110.4 (Energized Work) have been merged into 110.2(B) When Required
                                    110.2 General has been changed to 110.2(C) Requirements Until Established

                                110.4 Energized Work - Normal Working Conditions
                                Previously, Article 110.4 presented requirements regarding Energized Work. The article allowed normal operations of electric equipment in normal operating conditions. However, it presented the following conditions:

                                    Proper equipment installation.
                                    Proper equipment maintenance.
                                    Use of equipment according to the instructions.
                                    Ensuring that the equipment doors have been properly closed and secured.
                                    Ensuring that equipment covers are securely in their place and
                                    There is no evidence of the imminent failure of the equipment. 

                                However, now, this has been made part of 110.2 Electrically Safe Working Condition (B) When Required - Exception No. 1. Here, another change is seen with the addition of a requirement that says that the equipment must be rated for the fault current. 
                                Energized Work - Updated Working Conditions
                                With the addition of one more requirement, conditions for the normal operations of electric equipment in normal operating are now seven. Together, they are listed as:

                                    Proper equipment installation
                                    Proper equipment maintenance
                                    Use of equipment according to the given instructions.
                                    Ensuring that the equipment doors have been properly closed and secured.
                                    Ensuring that equipment covers are securely in their place and
                                    There is no evidence of the imminent failure of the equipment. 
                                    The equipment must be rated for the available fault current. 

                                You may be wondering how someone can detect equipment with the chance of imminent failure. Well, it mostly comes down to experience. Usually, the telltale signs of failing equipment include overheating or abnormal buzzing sounds. However, there are no particular limitations, and abnormality is immediately reported. 
                                Changes in 110.4 (A)
                                In 110.4(A)(1) Qualified Person, the word special has been replaced by applicable. This will ensure that the qualified person is only required to be aware of the techniques they will need to use in their work. What we mean by this is that previously, 110.4(A)(1) said:
                                Such persons shall also be familiar with the proper use of special precautionary techniques. 
                                Now, here, the word special has been replaced by the word applicable, as mentioned previously. Now, the Article says:
                                Such persons shall also be familiar with the proper use of applicable precautionary techniques.
                                Another change in this article is replacing the word can with shall. Now, the statement a person can be qualified for certain equipment and tasks to be performed would be read as a person shall be qualified for certain equipment and tasks to be performed.
                                30.5 (H) - Equipment Labeling Requirements
                                Article 130.5 (H) contains equipment labeling requirements. Although these requirements have not been changed much in the 2024 edition, they still need to be discussed because of their importance. First, Article 10.5(H) requires labels to show the following information:

                                    Nominal system voltage, and 
                                    Arc flash boundary

                                Apart from these requirements, the label should also contain either.

                                    Available incident energy, or
                                    Arc flash PPE category, as described in Table 130.7(C)(15))(a)/(b) 

                                A schematic example of a warning label is given on the next page.
                                Lesson Summary
                                The key points covered in the module are: 
                                What does NFPA 70 E Cover?

                                    Conductors connecting electrical installations with an electrical supply and
                                    Electrical equipment and conductors are present on (or within) the buildings or recreational vehicles, mobile homes, and other similar premises, such as industrial substations, carnivals, parking lots, yards, etc.

                                        Definitions

                                        According to the Occupational Health & Safety Act (Act no. 85 of 1993), what is:
                                        Definition of "Hazard"
                                        Definition of "Hazardous Substance"
                                        Definition of "Risk"
                                        Definition of "Safe"
                                        Hazard means a source of risk or an area where danger may be present.
                                        Statutory Requirements of the OHSA

                                        Mandates that the employer provide and maintain a risk-free working environment for the employees' health to the extent that this is practically practicable.
                                        Basics of Health and Safety:
                                            Create a policy for health and safety.
                                            Control hazards and risk evaluation at work.
                                            Report illnesses and accidents.

                                            Consult with your staff.
                                            Basics of Health and Safety
                                            Workforce Compliance
                                            The OHS Act generally places management in charge of health and safety, but the worker is also required to abide by specific legal requirements.
                                            We will focus on the fundamental guidelines that apply to employees throughout the duration of this course.
                                            Every employee has a responsibility to take reasonable precautions for his or her own, as well as others, health and safety at work. In other words, it is up to each employee to look out for their own health and safety.
                                            Working Conditions
                                            Legislation
                                            Based on Legislation in Section 14 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                                            Based on Legislation in Section 13 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                                            Every employee has the right to be kept informed.

                                            The employer must ensure that the employee knows the health and safety risks associated with any job being done, anything being produced, processed, utilized, stored, handled, or transported, and any equipment or machinery being used.
                                            Employee Involvement
                                            Based on Legislation in Section 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                                            Based on Legislation in Section 42 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                                            An employee who violates a provision of the OHS Act may face legal action.
                                            They may face a fine, punishment, or even incarceration. (A maximum fine of R 50 000 or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months, or both such fine and imprisonment)

                                            The employer must then offer information on how to take precautions against these threats.


                                            Unsafe and Unhealthy Situations
                                            Possess the proper workplace amenities
                                        Apply the use of PPE ( Personal Protective Equipment ) correctl

                                Workman's Compensation Procedures

                                    After an injury or accident, the employer must compensate 75% of the worker's salary for up to three months. The employer will receive this money back once the Compensation Fund begins compensating the worker.
                                    All businesses are required to pay an annual assessment fee after registering with the Compensation Fund depending on their employees' salaries and the risks connected with the type of job performed.


                                Workman's Compensation
                                The COIDA was amended in 1997, Act No 61 of 1997. Unlike the old Workmen's Compensation Act, COIDA covers most employees, not only those who earn less than a certain amount. 
                                Workers who are injured on duty or have an occupational disease can claim compensation for permanent or temporary disablement.
                                All employers, as per the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Amendment Act No 61 of 1997 (COIDA), must register for worker's compensation. Any employer who fails to do this is guilty of a criminal offence.
                                How Do I Claim Workman’s Compensation in South Africa?

                                Inform your immediate boss or employer (verbally or in writing). Make a list of everyone who saw the accident. WCL 2: Notice of Accident and Claim for Compensation is the form that must be filled ou
                                Observing Task Performance
                                When determining if something is a physical hazard, consider whether physical harm to an employee could occur.
                                Everyday workplace objects, such as flammable items or objects that may violently react to other environmental factors, could be included.
                                Personal Protective Equipment
                                Gloves, safety goggles, safety shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, vests, and full-body suits are examples of personal protection equipment.
                                Safety gear is crucial in the workplace because it shields wearers from safety hazards and potential health. It is also known as PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), and it guarantees a secure, enjoyable working environment for everyone by reducing the potential of accidents, illnesses, and legal problems. 
                                PPE Training
                                Employers are obligated to supply PPE at no cost to employees where it is necessary to safeguard workers.
                                Employees who must wear PPE must get training to understand the following:

                                    When is PPE required?
                                    What kind of PPE is required?
                                    How to put on, take off, adjust, and wear anything properly.
                                    PPE's limitations.
                                    Upkeep, usefulness, and proper disposal.

                                Head Protection (Hard Hats )

                                    A strong, protective shell that deflects and resists head trauma.
                                    The hat's internal suspension mechanism serves as a shock absorber.
                                    Some hats act as electrical shock isolators.
                                    Protects from splashes, spills, and drips for your head, face, neck, and shoulders.
                                    By altering them, you may add face shields, goggles, hoods, or hearing protection to several hats. 
                                    Fighting Fire
                                    Fire extinguishers come in a variety of designs to combat various fire classes. The following are the top three categories of fire extinguishers:
                                    Water (APW) Fire Extinguishers
                                    Large, silver fire extinguishers that are 11 kilograms in weight when full and stand 600 millimeters tall.
                                    APW is an abbreviation for "Air-Pressurized Water."

                                    They are simply big squirt cannons filled with regular tap water and pressured air.

                                Class A Fires
                                APWs are designed for Class A fires only: Wood, paper, cloth.
                                APWs are designed for Class A fires only: Wood, paper, cloth.
                                APWs will be found in older buildings, particularly in public hallways.
                                 
                                They will also be found in computer laboratories. It is important to remember, however, that computer equipment must be disconnected from its electrical source before using a water extinguisher on it.
                                Using water on a flammable liquid fire could cause the fire to spread.
                                Using water on an electrical fire increases the risk of electrocution. If you have no choice but to use an APW on an electrical fire, make sure the electrical equipment is unplugged or de-energized.
                                Fire Fighting Techniques
                                Fog Attack
                                Indirect Attack
                                Direct Attack
                                Combination Attack
                                The ‘Two Lines in’ method
                                The hose's fog setting works well to put out flames in tight spaces where there is no breeze.
                                This is employed by fire departments all around the nation and is praised for its success in putting out fires.

                                This method, which is most frequently applied to closed-compartment fires, puts out the fire by using the hose's fog nozzle rather than its jet.
                                Safety Measures

                                Management to ensure that procedures for the identification of emergencies are known and followed promptly and correctly.

                                No matter how many safety measures are put in place, emergencies can still happen. Emergency Preparedness does not end with well-maintained fire equipment, First Aid, and clearly labelled emergency exits. 

                                Every employer and employee needs a good understanding of the procedures the company has in place to handle emergencies. 
                                Everyone should understand their role during an emergency and understand what needs to be done to keep themselves and their fellow employees safe.
                                Accident and Incident Investigations

                                The investigation should officially start within seven days and finalize as soon as is reasonably practicable or within the contracted period in the case of contracted workers. 
                                Accurate records of the investigation must be kept.
                                Accident Book
                                Within your accident book, you should record details like:

                                    The name, gender, date of birth, and job title of the injured party.
                                    The date the accident happened.
                                    The date the accident was reported.
                                    The name and job title of the person logging the accident.
                                    Whether or not the injured party is an expectant mother. 

                                Legislation

                                According to subsection (c), the following incidents endangering the health and safety of any person must also be reported to an inspector:

                                    Where a dangerous substance was spilt. 
                                    Where the uncontrolled release of any substance under pressure took place. 
                                    Where machinery or any part thereof is fractured or failed, resulting in flying, falling, or uncontrolled moving objects. 
                                    Where machinery ran out of control. 
                                    Details of the Incident
                                    Details of the incident include:
                                        What happened?
                                        Where it happened (place)?

                                        We also need to look at the reporting of workplace incidents where machinery is involved.

                                        According to Regulation 7 of the General Machinery Regulations, the following incidents involving machinery must be reported to an inspector:
                                        Where machinery ran out of control as a result of the failure of a control or safety equipment and could have caused an injury to a person who had been conveyed on or in such machinery or had been in the vicinity thereof

                                        Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005

                                        The 2005 Act states that "Every employer shall ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health, and welfare at work of his or her employees."

                                        Consultation
                                        In the case of a school, the "employer" is the Board of Management, or the Vocational Education Committee (VEC).

                                        All teaching and ancillary staff are employees of the school, and so have the responsibilities and rights of employees as d
                                        State the main features of a safety statement.
                                        Risk Assessment

                                        The control of risks is critical in meeting the requirements of the 2005 Act.

                                        There are three basic stages in making the workplace safe:
                                            Identifying the hazards
                                            Evaluating the risks
                                            Implementing risk controls
                                        These stages are together known as "Risk Assessment" and are covered in this course.
                                        Reasonably Practicable: Many of the employer's requirements are to do as much "as is reasonably practicable" to provide a safe place, safe methods, and safe facilities for work. This means that the employer must exercise all due care, having identified the hazards and assessed the risks.
                                        Competence: The Act and associated regulations require the employer to appoint a "competent person" to advise on the management of safety and health or complete specific risk assessments in the school. A competent person must be deemed to have sufficient training, experience, and knowledge appropriate to the task. The Principal may consider teachers to be competent to conduct risk assessments in their own classrooms or workrooms.
                                        Duties and Responsibilities
                                        While school management authorities - in most cases, Boards of Management - have the ultimate responsibility for safety and health matters in schools, safety is everybody's responsibility. The 2005 Act applies to all employers, employees in all employments, and to the self-employed. It also has implications for persons who control places of work.
                                        The following are the various safety and health  duties  and responsibilities  of people within the school:
                                        Principal

                                        As the person in charge, the Principal oversees safety at the school. The Principal must ensure that the safety statement is applied and should strive to develop a safety culture at the school.
                                        Safety Officer 
                                        Employee Duties
                                        Employees' duties include complying with safety and health legislation and taking reasonable care to protect their own safety and that of others. They must report hazards or hazardous activity to management and take full account of training and instructions given by the Principal or any person acting on the employer's or Principal's behalf.
                                        Competent Persons
                                        The 2005 Act places a special emphasis on the competence of persons carrying out safety-related tasks. The Act states that a person is competent 'where, having regard to the task he/she is required to perform possesses sufficient training, experience, and knowledge.
                                        The Principal may consider a teacher competent to conduct a risk assessment within their own class environment or workroom, as part of managing safety in their school.


                                        Safety Representative
                                        uties and Responsibilities - The Technology Classroom

                                        Before a new technology classroom is used for the first time, the technology teacher typically works with the Principal or safety officer to ensure that the technology classroom conforms to required standards. Equipment, fittings, lighting, ventilation, layout, signage must all be considered, and the school's maintenance staff may be required to assist.
                                        Teachers must manage safety and health matters related to their work. Section 15 of the 2005 Act outlines the general duties of persons in control of places of work.

                                        Students have a responsibility to act in a way that does not compromise the safety of anybody in the school.
                                        The technology teacher may take care of routine safety matters, like simple maintenance issues. If the matter is more complex, the technology teacher may liaise with the appropriate contacts at the school and relevant maintenance personnel.
                                        Responsibilities for Safety: Scenarios
                                            Warehouse worker
                                            Data entry operator
                                            Painter
                                        Warehouse Worker
                                        Data Entry Operator
                                        Painter
                                        Warehouse worker: Shauna, a warehouse worker, uses an old ladder to get to supplies that are piled high on a shelving unit. She is afraid that the ladder will break each time she uses it, but it is the only ladder there.

                                        Recommendation: Shauna should tell her supervisor about the worn ladder. Her employer must provide a safe means of reaching heights, and the employer can examine ways of changing the system of work.
                                        Employer’s Responsibilities
                                        The law requires that every employer ensures the safety, health and welfare of his or her employees while at work.
                                        Employers must:
                                            Ensure the place of work is safe, and all plant, machinery, and equipment used for work are safe.
                                            Provide and maintain safe working methods.
                                            Prevent any conduct likely to put the safety of employees at risk.

                                            Provide information, instruction, training, and supervision necessary to ensure the safety of employees at work.

                                            Ensure risk assessments are carried out and implement measures necessary to ensure safety.

                                            Prepare and revise plans and procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency.

                                            Report accidents and dangerous occurrences as appropriate to the Health and Safety Authority.

                                            If necessary, obtain the service of a person who ¡s competent in safety matters, to ensure that employees’ safety and health is secure at work.

                                            Provide and maintain protective clothing and equipment as necessary.
                                            Responsibilities of the Public
                                            While employers and employees have specific duties in maintaining safety and health, everybody else has a duty to support their efforts. This applies to customers, suppliers, and all other visitors to a place of work. The law forbids anybody from interfering with, misusing, or damaging anything provided under safety and health legislation.
                                            Self-Employed People
                                            A self-employed person has the same responsibilities as any employer, and must ensure that people are safe where they work.
                                            Responsibilities in Schools
                                            In school, everybody present has a responsibility to ensure that the classrooms and common areas are safe.

                                            For example, if you come across a coat lying across a walkway in the classroom, you should hang it up out of harm’s way.

                                            If you see a trailing cable in the classroom, report it to the teacher who can take action.

                                            If a window is broken, the broken glass is a serious hazard, you should tell your teacher or the caretaker as soon as possible.
                                            Safety Statement
                                            Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the employer and persons in control of places of work must prepare a safety statement. 
                                            A safety statement specifies how the safety of everybody at the school is secured and managed. It documents work done as well as plans for maintaining and improving safety in schools. It also clarifies roles and responsibilities for safety in specific contexts - laboratories, workshops, classrooms, sports halls, and so on.
                                            For workplaces, a safety statement carries the same meaning. It is a report of all the hazards and risks found in a workplace, and an account of controls put in place to manage them. It explains in detail how the employer plans to ensure a safe and healthy work environment for both workers and visitors.
                                            Benefits of a Safety Statement
                                                Using a safety statement, an employer can make safety issues clear to workers.
                                                It also helps to make everybody aware of the importance of safety at work, and provides a safe approach for each task in the workplace.
                                                ontributors to the Safety Statement
                                                Where a safety officer is appointed, he or she works with the Principal to create the safety statement. If a safety representative is nominated by employees, that person may also contribute to the safety statement. Each school may set up a safety committee to regularly review safety issues.
                                                Emergency

                                                The safety statement needs to include procedures to be followed when an accident occurs and in the event of an emergency or serious danger.
                                                Safety Statement Preparation
                                                You must document full details of all hazards Identified in and on the school and workplaces, and the risk assessment of each in the safety statement. You must also describe the control measures put in place to minimise or eliminate each hazard.
                                                Roles and Responsibilities
                                                    Individual responsibilities should be stated in the school's safety statement and should refer to specific job titles. The safety officer and safety representative should be named where they are appointed, and the safety duties of the caretaker, teachers, and any other staff should be set out.
                                                    All staff should be able to learn their safety roles from the safety statement. The Principal must bring the safety statement to the attention of all staff and the relevant section to all others who may be exposed to risks so that they are aware of the risks and any controls in place.
                                                    For workplaces, a Safety Representative may be selected by employees to represent them on matters of safety, health, and welfare in the workplace.  A safety committee will be appointed for a large workplace
                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                    Section 25 of the 2005 Act sets out the functions of safety representatives that allow them to act on behalf of employees to help ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
                                                    In schools,  teachers must manage safety and health matters related to their work as outlined by Section 15 of the 2005 Act.
                                                    A safety statement specifies how the safety of everybody at the school is secured and managed.
                                                    Some of the main features of a safety statement are:
                                                        Accident procedures.
                                                        Controls to reduce risk.
                                                        The selection and function of a safety representative.
                                                    The safety representative can be selected by the employees, including non-teaching staff

                                                    (in the case of schools), to represent them on matters of safety, health, and welfare.
                                                    Hazards
                                                    A hazard is anything that could cause harm. Hazards take many different shapes, and may even be Invisible. While some hazards are fairly easy to spot, others are not. For example, stress, exposure to noise, or radiation are less obvious than, say, a trailing cable.
                                                    Hazards at School
                                                    Some situations that may seem safe upon inspection may be hazards if viewed at a different time. For example, an obstacle In a corridor poses little threat during class times, but at lunch break or between Basses, It could be a serious trip hazard.
                                                    Workplace Hazards
                                                    The school is obliged by law to do all it can to ensure the safety of all who work and study there. You must identify the hazards and do what you can to eliminate or reduce the risk to a minimum.
                                                    Types of Hazards
                                                    High-stress levels, machinery, a poorly designed workstation can all be hazardous. It is important to be aware of all Types of Hazards.
                                                    Hazards In the workplace may change with circumstances. A schoolbag is not hazardous in itself. However, left in a classroom aisle, it presents a trip hazard.
                                                    Potential Hazards Found in Schools
                                                    Hazards vary around the school. Consider the potential hazards of the kitchen, technology classroom, laboratory, sports hall and stores, and the general classroom. 
                                                        Kitchen: Slippery floors, Hot surfaces, Sharp objects, Chemical cleaners, Stress.
                                                        Technology Classroom: Sharp tools, Machinery, Manual handling, Trailing cables, Large pieces of materials, Dust, Manual handling.
                                                        Laboratory: Chemicals, Dissecting kit, Burners.
                                                        General Classroom: Damaged seats, Protruding nails or screws, Trailing cables, Broken sockets, Broken light fittings, Windows on the first floor and higher, Bullying.
                                                        Spots Hall and Store Room: Manual Handling, High shelving, Gym equipment, Bullying.
                                                        Types of Hazards


                                                        There are six basic hazard types. Knowing these will make it easier to spot hazards in many different contexts.
                                                        Biological Agent
                                                        Bacteria, Viruses, Substances from plants or animals causing infection and other health problems.
                                                        Health
                                                        Chemical
                                                        Physical
                                                        What is Risk
                                                        Risk is the likelihood that a hazard will actually cause harm. For example, working at a height is a hazard. There is a risk of falling.
                                                        Working with cutting machines is a hazard. There may a risk from flying debris, or from becoming entangled.
                                                        Hazard and Risk
                                                        Chemicals held in containers are hazardous but there is very little risk while they are stored safely.
                                                        Serious risk can arise when chemicals are in use, whether in the laboratory or around the school. Be mindful that many cleaning agents can be hazardous.
                                                        Hazard versus Risk
                                                        Levels of risk vary with conditions. For example, most areas of the school are low risk at quiet times, but at lunchtime, when many students are moving about, risk levels rise noticeably.For example, the likelihood of an accident through student horseplay or somebody tripping over a schoolbag is much greater during lunchtime or between classes.
                                                        Measuring Risk
                                                        Risk Levels
                                                        A grass maintenance programme in a small school with a small lawn and no playing field presents a far lower level of risk than that of a large school with multiple areas and extensive grounds.
                                                        Risk Measurement Factors: The level of risk depends on how likely it is that a user will be injured under normal conditions and usage, how serious any injuries that result could be, and how many people are involved.
                                                        Calculating Risk - 1: Likelihood x Severity of the potential injury x Number of people who may be exposed to the hazard.
                                                        Consider a certain hazard, and rate that from 1, meaning not very likely, to 3 meaning quite likely. Then rate the possible Injury that might be caused by the hazard and rate 1 for not severe to 3, very severe. Finally, rate the number of people in contact with the hazard or the area around it, 1 for very few, to 3 for quite a lot.
                                                        Levels of Risk
                                                            High: A strong chance of injury occurring, and the injury could be serious or very serious.

                                                            Medium: Some chance of injury and severity. For example, an injury to a limb.
                                                            Low: Very little chance of injury and, if an injury were to happen, it would be very minor.
                                                            Risk Assessment
                                                            Risk assessment is the consideration of any risk that may arise from identified hazards. It involves collecting information and making decisions.
                                                            If your assessment is that a risk exists, you must take action to eliminate or minimise that risk.
                                                            Risk Assessment Steps
                                                                Identify the hazards.
                                                                Estimate the risk from each hazard.
                                                                Consider how to eliminate or reduce that risk.
                                                                Document a plan to eliminate or minimise the hazard.
                                                            All employers must carry out risk assessments for every activity that occurs on their premises, Identify hazards, and assess the risks arising. 
                                                        Human-Factor:

                                                        Ergonomic
                                                        Simple Risk Assessment - Manual Handling
                                                        Consider a load of heavy boxes delivered to the school. Heavy loads can cause a serious back injury to somebody who does not lift them properly, or for whom they are too heavy. The hazard is the heavy load; the risk is the chance of a back injury.
                                                        To lift safely you should:
                                                            Clear the area of all obstacles.
                                                            Give yourself plenty of room.
                                                            Consider the weight and shape of the load.
                                                            Keep feet hip-distance apart.
                                                            Stand with feet in the direction you are going.
                                                            Place feet firmly on the ground.

                                                            Bend your knees, not your back.
                                                            Grip firmly using the palm of your hand.
                                                            Keep close to the load.

                                                            Keep the load close to your centre of gravity.
                                                            Control Measures
                                                            To eliminate or reduce risk, you put control measures in place.  When deciding how to control risk, you should follow the General Principles of Prevention, set out in the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005. 

                                                            Nine Principles of Prevention:
                                                                 Avoidance: The avoidance of risks or removing the risk altogether.
                                                                 Evaluation:  The evaluation of unavoidable risks. Calculate the level of those risks that cannot be avoided.
                                                                Combating: The combating of risks at source, taking immediate action where possible.
                                                                Adaptation of work: The adaptation of work to the individual, especially with regard to the design of places of work, and the choice of work equipment.
                                                                Adaptation of place: The adaptation of the place of work to technical progress.
                                                                Replacement:  The replacement of dangerous articles, substances, systems of work by safe or less dangerous alternatives.
                                                                Giving of priority: The giving of priority to collective protective measures over individual protective measures - look after everyone and not just the individual.
                                                                Development of policy: The development of an adequate prevention policy in relation to this type of risk.
                                                                Training: The provision of appropriate training, instruction, and protective equipment to employees.Employers must apply the principles of prevention to avoid hazards. Where hazards cannot be avoided, employers must assess the risk and reduce it by using measures that protect all workers or by using safer work procedures.
                                                                Where hazards cannot be avoided or reduced, employers have a duty to put in place appropriate measures for the protection of workers such as training and signage.
                                                                Avoidance
                                                                The first option you must consider when dealing with risk is to avoid the hazard completely, and so eliminate the risk altogether. If you can, you remove the dangerous item, or rearrange things so that the hazard no longer exists.
                                                                Evaluation
                                                                When you cannot remove risk, you must evaluate the risk that you can't avoid. This allows you to analyse the situation and helps you to come up with solutions.
                                                                Risk Reduction
                                                                After evaluation, you act to reduce the level of risk. This might mean, for example, making sure that there is somebody holding the bottom of a ladder, when in use.
                                                                Working Safely
                                                                Safe System of Work
                                                                Every employer must implement a safe system of work. This means that employers must provide systems of work that are planned, organised, performed, maintained, and revised as appropriate. Hazards associated with work activities must be identified and appropriate control measures put in place before work commences. All workers must be made aware of their responsibilities regarding safety.
                                                                Safety Duties
                                                                As an employer, or, as in the case of a School Principal, the representative of the employer, you are obliged to inform all staff of their safety duties. Students also need to know that they have a responsibility not to behave in a way that might add or create risk.
                                                                Safety Culture
                                                                You also need to develop a safety culture in the school, so that safety becomes natural and is not regarded as a chore. Relevant safety signage, training, and discussions of safety issues can serve well in this regard. Attitudes are also a key element of a safety culture.
                                                                Use of Chemicals in Schools

                                                                    Key OHSE Concepts
                                                                    OHSE covers three primary areas:
                                                                        ✅Occupational Health focuses on preventative health measures that ensure worker well-being, addressing both physical and mental health needs.
                                                                        ✅Safety refers to the procedures and protocols designed to prevent accidents and injuries in the workplace, from hazard identification to risk mitigation.
                                                                        ✅Environmental Management minimises negative environmental impacts by promoting sustainable practices in resource use, waste management, and pollution reduction.
                                                                    The Multidisciplinary Nature of OHSE is integral to its effectiveness. This approach draws on health sciences, engineering, psychology, and environmental studies, offering a holistic view of workplace safety that combines ethical practices, human behaviour insights, and scientific advancements. By integrating these fields, organisations create a comprehensive system that prioritises both human and environmental heal
                                                                    Human Factors in OHSE
                                                                    Human factors play a crucial role in understanding how various psychological, physiological, and ergonomic elements influence worker safety and productivity. By addressing these aspects, organisations can effectively reduce risks, enhance job satisfaction, and improve overall safety.
                                                                    Psychological factors such as high-stress environments, repetitive tasks, and mental fatigue are particularly relevant in high-risk sectors. For instance, stress management resources, coupled with ergonomic practices, help to reduce fatigue and prevent accidents. Ergonomic considerations are also essential, as poorly designed workstations or tools can lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and repetitive strain injuries. Conducting ergonomic assessments and providing customised workstations help maintain worker comfort and minimise strain

                                                                    ISO 45001 is the international benchmark for occupational health and safety (OH&S) management systems. It sets the standard for organisations looking to proactively improve safety and reduce health and environmental risks. This globally recognised framework supports organisations in creating structured safety protocols that integrate seamlessly with business practices. Unlike previous standards, such as OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001 places a strong emphasis on embedding safety into all organisational activities, from top management decision-making to daily operations, creating a safer and more cohesive workplace environment.
                                                                    Introduction to Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001)
                                                                    ISO 14001 is a globally recognised standard that assists organisations in developing effective environmental management systems (EMS) to control and mitigate environmental impacts, conserve resources, and comply with regulations.
                                                                    Purpose and Overview of ISO 14001
                                                                    An EMS under ISO 14001 provides a structured approach for organisations to achieve environmental sustainability while enhancing their public image and meeting legal obligations. This standard enables organisations to integrate sustainability into their daily operations, supporting the global goal of environmental protection while improving operational efficiency.
                                                                    ISO 14001 incorporates several core elements designed to manage environmental impact systematically. These include setting an environmental policy, establishing measurable objectives, identifying potential environmental risks, and regularly monitoring and improving environmental performance. Adhering to ISO 14001’s guidelines helps organisations meet regulatory standards, avoid potential penalties, and foster a commitment to long-term environmental sustainability.
                                                                    Core Elements of ISO 14001
                                                                    ISO 14001 is built around several essential components that guide organisations in creating and sustaining an effective EMS. The development of an environmental policy is the foundation, where organisations outline their environmental goals, responsibilities, and strategies for achieving sustainability.
                                                                    Environmental planning follows, identifying key environmental risks and setting measurable objectives to mitigate these impacts. This phase includes evaluating compliance requirements, which align organisational practices with local and international regulations, ensuring that operational activities meet or exceed environmental standards.
                                                                    Monitoring and Evaluation are critical for assessing environmental performance. Organisations use these tools to track progress toward objectives, address areas needing improvement, and ensure compliance with ISO 14001 standards. Continuous improvement is embedded in ISO 14001, requiring organisations to regularly review and update their EMS to address new environmental challenges, regulatory changes, or organisational shifts. Through this iterative process, organisations strengthen their commitment to sustainability, promoting responsible resource usage and waste reduction over time.

                                                                            Identifying hazards is a proactive approach in OHSE that enables organisations to detect and address potential risks before they result in accidents, injuries, or health issues. Hazards are broadly classified into four main categories: physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic, each requiring specific techniques for identification and management to ensure a safe workplace.
                                                                            tance of continuous monitoring and updating hazard identification processes to adapt to changing workplace conditions.
                                                                            Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Assessment Methods
                                                                            In OHSE, risk assessment is crucial for evaluating the likelihood of hazards and their potential impact on health, safety, and operations. By systematically assessing risks, organisations can prioritise hazard control efforts, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted mitigation measures. Risk assessment is broadly categorised into two main approaches: qualitative and quantitative, each with unique methodologies and applications.
                                                                    Control Measures and the Hierarchy of Controls
                                                                    The hierarchy of controls provides a structured framework for managing workplace hazards by prioritising control measures according to their effectiveness. This model allows organisations to address hazards at their source, aiming to eliminate or reduce risks before they reach employees. The hierarchy of controls is widely used in OHSE as it offers a systematic approach to risk reduction, moving from the most effective controls to the least effective. By following this structure, organisations can establish multiple layers of protection, significantly enhancing workplace safety.
                                                                    Hazard Communication and Labelling
                                                                    Effective hazard communication is essential in OHSE as it ensures that all employees are aware of potential risks in their workplace, which is a fundamental component of a safe working environment. By clearly communicating hazards through labelling, signage, and information sheets, organisations provide employees with the knowledge needed to handle materials safely and respond appropriately to potential hazards.
                                                                    This topic covers the importance of communication, the role of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), and practical applications in creating a transparent and safety-focused workplac
                                                                    International OHSE Regulations and Standards
                                                                    International OHSE standards and regulations form the foundation of workplace safety practices, providing universally recognised guidelines that organisations can implement to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of employees. Key regulatory bodies like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the European Union (EU), and the International Labour Organization (ILO) enforce compliance and promote best practices across various industries. These standards, such as ISO 45001 for safety and ISO 14001 for environmental management, help companies meet both legal requirements and ethical obligations.
                                                                    Overview of Key Regulatory Bodies
                                                                    OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)
                                                                    Scope and Impact: OSHA is a US-based agency that sets and enforces safety regulations across industries, including construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. OSHA standards, outlined in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, cover areas such as machine safety, hazardous materials, and personal protective equipment (PPE). OSHA’s General Duty Clause also mandates that employers provide a workplace free of recognised hazards.
                                                                    Requirements: OSHA mandates regular inspections, employee training, hazard communication, and incident reporting to ensure compliance. Failure to adhere can result in substantial fines and legal action. For example, OSHA enforces stringent fall protection measures in construction, requiring the use of guardrails and fall arrest systems to prevent injuries.
                                                                    Overview of Key Regulatory Bodies Continued
                                                                    European Union (EU) OHSE Directives
                                                                        Harmonised Standards and New Approach: The EU’s approach involves directives that set minimum OHSE requirements, such as the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC. This directive mandates that employers assess and mitigate workplace risks, apply safety measures, and provide safety training. Member countries transpose these directives into national legislation, allowing for regionally adapted implementation.
                                                                        Key Standards and Compliance: European standards, such as those created by CEN and CENELEC, enable organisations to meet “essential safety requirements.” Complying with these standards allows companies to apply CE marking on products, indicating conformity to EU safety standards.
                                                                        Specific Examples: EU regulations address high-risk areas like machinery operation, chemical handling (Chemical Agents Directive), and noise exposure (Physical Agents Directive).

                                                                            Providing a Safe Workplace: Employers are legally required to identify and mitigate workplace hazards by conducting regular risk assessments. This includes analysing potential risks, such as mechanical equipment, hazardous chemicals, or physical layouts, to ensure that all potential dangers are accounted for and managed effectively.
                                                                            Supply and Maintenance of PPE: Employers must supply appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to workers at no cost. Examples include gloves, helmets, eye protection, and respiratory equipment, depending on the workplace risks. Additionally, employers are responsible for maintaining PPE and ensuring its availability at all times.
                                                                            Information and Training: Employers must provide training and education on safe practices, including how to use machinery, handle hazardous materials, and follow emergency procedures. OSHA, for instance, requires that all safety training be conducted in a language and vocabulary that workers understand, ensuring clear comprehension and compliance.
                                                                            Safety Protocols and Emergency Preparedness: Employers are required to establish clear safety procedures and emergency response plans, including evacuations and first-aid protocols. This is reinforced by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, which mandate that employers have structured plans for emergencies and effective communication in case of incidents.
                                                                            Monitoring and Recordkeeping: Employers must document all incidents, injuries, safety inspections, and employee training records. This documentation helps demonstrate compliance during audits and provides data for improving safety protocols. OSHA also requires that companies report certain severe incidents within a specific timeframe, helping to maintain transparency and accountability.
                                                                            Employer Obligations Under OHSE Law Continued

                                                                    Accurate documentation in OHSE is essential for legal compliance, risk management, and accountability. It provides the evidence needed to meet regulatory standards, manage safety risks, and ensure transparency, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement in workplace safety.
                                                                    Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Compliance documentation, including incident reports, inspection logs, and training records, is vital for demonstrating adherence to OHSE laws. Regulatory bodies require organisations to maintain these records for a certain period, as they provide evidence of compliance and the effectiveness of safety measures. Proper documentation helps organisations avoid penalties, fines, and liability issues by proving they follow legal safety requirements.
                                                                    Risk Management and Safety Improvement: By keeping detailed records of incidents, near misses, and hazards, organisations can monitor trends, identify recurring risks, and implement preventive measures. For instance, analysing incident reports over time may reveal that certain areas of the workplace are more prone to accidents, prompting a need for increased safety measures in those areas.
                                                                    Accountability and Transparency: Well-organised documentation enables both internal and external stakeholders to verify that safety procedures are followed. In the case of an incident, records such as safety checklists and training attendance provide an accountable record of steps

                                                                    Essential compliance documents, such as incident reports, training records, and safety data sheets, are critical for maintaining workplace safety. These documents ensure that hazards are identified, risks are managed, and employees are well-informed, supporting both compliance and safety.
                                                                        Incident Reports and Hazard Logs: Incident reports detail accidents and near misses, helping organisations analyse causes and implement corrective actions. A comprehensive hazard log, recording all identified risks, supports a proactive approach to risk management by enabling continuous monitoring of safety hazards.
                                                                        Training Records: Documenting safety training sessions, including the topics covered and attendees, is critical for compliance. Training records confirm that employees have been educated on necessary safety procedures, reducing liability and reinforcing employee awareness.
                                                                        Safety Data Sheets (SDS): For organisations that handle hazardous materials, SDS are required to inform employees about chemical properties, handling guidelines, and emergency response procedures. SDS help standardise information about hazards, which is essential for both compliance and the safe handling of dangerous substanc

                                                                    Best practices in record-keeping and reporting ensure that OHSE documentation is accurate, accessible, and secure. By using digital systems, standardising templates, automating reminders, and ensuring data security, organisations can improve efficiency, maintain compliance, and support continuous safety improvements.

                                                                            Workplace mental health focuses on managing psychosocial hazards and fostering a supportive work environment. These specialised topics delve into the types of hazards, risk assessment practices, intervention strategies, evaluation methods, and the role of organisational culture in promoting mental well-being.
                                                                        Psychosocial Risk Assessments
                                                                        Conducting psychosocial risk assessments is a critical step in identifying workplace mental health risks. These assessments allow organisations to pre-emptively address risks that could impact employee well-being, reduce productivity, and increase turnover. Using tools aligned with global standards, such as ISO 45003, organisations can better manage these risks in line with broader Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) policies
                                                                        Purpose of Psychosocial Risk Assessments
                                                                        The primary aim of psychosocial risk assessments is to identify potential risks to mental health within the workplace, enabling organisations to develop appropriate preventive and protective measures. This process considers factors like workload, organisational support, and interpersonal dynamics that contribute to stress and other psychological challenges. By understanding these risks, organisations can implement strategies to create a safe and supportive environment, which has been shown to enhance employee engagement and reduce absenteeism.
                                                                        In line with international standards, such as ISO 45003 and Safe Work Australia guidelines, psychosocial risk management prioritises minimising job demands and maximising job resources. Organisations gain actionable insights by assessing risk levels and can implement interventions that promote well-being and compliance with health and safety regulations.
                                                                        Steps in Conducting a Psychosocial Risk Assessment
                                                                        A structured, step-by-step approach is essential for effective psychosocial risk assessment:
                                                                            📚Data Collection: This foundational step uses surveys, interviews, and direct observations to gather qualitative and quantitative data on workplace conditions. Surveys like the People at Work tool and the Job Content Questionnaire are popular choices designed to capture insights into job demands, role clarity, and employee satisfaction. Organisations often benefit from supplementing surveys with focus groups, which allow employees to discuss specific stressors and suggest practical solutions tailored to their work environment.
                                                                            🔎Risk Identification: Analysing data from surveys and feedback sessions helps identify potential psychosocial hazards, including job demands, management practices, and organisational culture. This step emphasises examining the frequency, duration, and intensity of exposure to these hazards, as employees are impacted differently depending on their roles and responsibilities.
                                                                            🗒Analysis and Prioritisation: Once identified, risks are ranked according to their severity and likelihood, allowing organisations to prioritise hazards that require immediate intervention. Using a risk matrix for psychosocial factors similar to those used for physical hazards enables a clear visual representation of which risks are most critical. This prioritisation ensures resources are allocated effectively, focusing on high-impact areas that significantly affect mental health.
                                                                        Tools and Methodologies
                                                                        Several validated tools and methodologies can streamline the psychosocial risk assessment process:
                                                                            Employee Surveys: Tools like People at Work are evidence-based and widely adopted, allowing organisations to collect extensive data on psychosocial hazards and benchmark their findings against similar industries. Surveys are usually followed up with qualitative methods, such as focus groups, to clarify findings and design specific action plans.
                                                                            Feedback and Focus Groups: Following surveys, focus groups engage employees in discussions around identified risks. This collaborative process helps tailor solutions to fit actual workplace needs, which is especially important since psychosocial hazards can be subjective and vary greatly across different teams.
                                                                            Job Content Questionnaire: Used in various workplaces, this questionnaire helps organisations assess role-specific risks by focusing on job demands and control, social support, and reward structures. It provides a structured approach to data collection, which is crucial for developing targeted interventions.
                                                                            Strategies to Support Workplace Mental Health
                                                                            Promoting mental health within the workplace not only benefits employees but also enhances overall productivity, reduces absenteeism, and fosters a positive organisational culture. The upcoming slides contains key strategies to build and sustain a mentally healthy work environment.
                                                                        Developing a Supportive Environment
                                                                        Creating a supportive environment involves building a culture where employees feel comfortable discussing mental health issues without fear of judgment or reprisal. This open communication helps employees feel valued and supported, which can significantly mitigate stress and improve morale.
                                                                        Open Communication: Establishing clear communication channels encourages employees to discuss their concerns. Regular check-ins by managers and open-door policies signal to employees that their mental health is a priority. Anonymous feedback options, like suggestion boxes or digital surveys, allow employees to express concerns safely, creating transparency and building trust.
                                                                        Positive Workplace Culture: Fostering a culture of inclusion and respect reinforces a supportive environment. Emphasising diversity, teamwork, and recognition of achievements can enhance employee morale. Creating spaces for team-building activities and celebrating successes encourages a sense of belonging and reduces feelings of isolation.
                                                                        Physical Workspace Adjustments: Designing a workspace that supports well-being through ergonomic furniture, natural lighting, and relaxation spaces helps reduce stress and increase comfort.

                                                                            Discuss the significance of record-keeping and compliance audits in maintaining occupational health standards.
                                                                        Recognition and Control of Occupational Health Hazards
                                                                        Industrial environments expose employees to various health hazards that can impact their well-being and productivity. Recognising these hazards and implementing appropriate control strategies is essential for maintaining a safe workplace. The structured approach outlined in the hierarchy of controls helps prioritise methods to reduce or eliminate these risks effectively.
                                                                        Types of Occupational Health Hazards
                                                                        Occupational health hazards fall into several categories, each requiring specific identification techniques and control strategies to ensure worker safety.
                                                                        Chemical hazards stem from exposure to substances like solvents, dust, gases, and fumes, which can enter the body through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Industries such as manufacturing, chemical production, and mining frequently encounter these hazards. Exposure to these chemicals can lead to acute effects, such as respiratory irritation, and chronic conditions, including cancer or organ damage.
                                                                        ✔️Control Methods:
                                                                            Ventilation: Local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation systems help remove airborne contaminants from the workplace.
                                                                            PPE: Respirators, gloves, and protective suits provide personal protection where other controls are insufficient.
                                                                            Substitution: Replacing hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, where feasible, reduces health risks.
                                                                        Types of Occupational Health Hazards Continued
                                                                        Physical hazards include noise, extreme temperatures, radiation, and vibration. These risks are prevalent in construction, manufacturing, and energy sectors.
                                                                        ✔️Control Methods:
                                                                            Noise: Prolonged exposure to high noise levels leads to hearing loss. Dosimeters measure sound levels to assess noise exposure, and ear protection like earmuffs or earplugs helps mitigate risk.
                                                                            Thermal Stress: Working in extreme temperatures can cause heat stress or hypothermia. Solutions include temperature-controlled environments, hydration stations, and rest breaks.
                                                                            Radiation: Industries such as healthcare and nuclear energy encounter radiation risks. Shielding, monitoring devices, and dosimeters are essential for managing exposure.
                                                                        Exposure Assessment Techniques
                                                                        Assessing exposure levels in the workplace is essential for understanding risk and implementing the most effective control measures. Exposure assessment techniques vary based on the type of hazard, and they provide critical data for determining how much of a hazard is present and how it may impact worker health
                                                                        Control Measures: Engineering, Administrative and PPE
                                                                        Effective hazard control involves using a hierarchy of controls to manage and mitigate risks in the workplace. This framework prioritises control measures from most to least effective, starting with engineering solutions, followed by administrative strategies, and finally, personal protective equipment (PPE).
                                                                        Engineering Controls
                                                                        Engineering controls are interventions that aim to isolate or remove hazards from the workplace. These measures are considered the most effective, as they do not rely on individual behaviours and instead focus on controlling the environment.
                                                                            Ventilation Systems: Ventilation helps to manage airborne contaminants, particularly in environments with fumes, dust, or vapours. Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) captures contaminants at their source, directing them away from workers and outside the facility. LEV is crucial in industries like welding, painting, and chemical processing, where specific work areas need targeted ventilation. General Ventilation (also called dilution ventilation) manages overall air quality by diluting contaminants throughout the space, reducing workers' exposure to lower-risk airborne particles.
                                                                            Isolation and Enclosures: Isolating hazardous processes or materials in separate rooms or enclosures limits worker exposure. Isolation Rooms are common in laboratory and healthcare settings to prevent the spread of biological contaminants or hazardous chemicals. For example, containment hoods or glove boxes in labs keep biological and chemical hazards from escaping into the surrounding workspace. These barriers reduce contact with hazardous materials, especially in areas where contaminants are actively handled or generated.
                                                                            Automation and Mechanisation: In industries where repetitive, high-risk tasks are performed (like heavy lifting or exposure to hazardous substances), automation removes workers from direct exposure. Using robotic systems for handling toxic chemicals or heavy equipment reduces human interaction with hazardous processes, improving both safety and efficiency.

                                                                                Accident causation theories serve as frameworks to help safety professionals understand the root causes of workplace incidents. By studying these models, organisations can develop targeted strategies for risk mitigation, aiming to prevent accidents before they happen or minimise their impact when they do. Below are some of the most recognised theories in accident causation.
                                                                                📘Heinrich’s Domino Theory Overview:
                                                                                Developed by H.W. Heinrich in the 1930s, Domino Theory suggests that accidents occur due to a chain of events, much like a sequence of falling dominos. According to Heinrich, these dominos include factors such as social environment, faults of individuals, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, and, finally, the accident itself. If one of these dominos is removed such as an unsafe act or condition the accident sequence can be stopped.
                                                                                📣Applications: Domino Theory underscores the importance of intervening at any step in the chain to prevent accidents. For instance, providing additional training to employees or eliminating an unsafe condition on the production floor can prevent the final “domino,” or accident, from falling.
                                                                                al and external audits, help organisations evaluate compliance and identify areas for safety improvement.

                                                                                teps in Conducting Accident Investigations
                                                                                Securing the scene immediately after an accident is crucial to prevent further harm and preserve evidence for accurate investigation.
                                                                                I. Securing the Scene
                                                                                Initial Safety Measures: In the moments following an accident, it is essential to restrict access to the area to protect employees and prevent additional injuries. This may involve setting up barriers, marking the area with caution tape, and implementing an emergency response if there are hazards present, such as chemical spills, broken equipment, or fire risks. Restricting access also ensures that evidence remains undisturbed for the investigation.
                                                                                Preserving Evidence: Preserving the integrity of the scene is key to an accurate investigation. Investigators should document the scene by taking photographs, drawing diagrams, and noting the exact locations of objects, tools, or equipment involved. Physical evidence, such as damaged machinery or spilled substances, should be left untouched until recorded. Investigators may also collect samples or secure digital records (e.g., CCTV footage) to aid in recreating the incident.
                                                                                Steps in Conducting Accident Investigations Continued
                                                                                Comprehensive evidence collection is vital for understanding what occurred and identifying the causes behind the incident.
                                                                                II. Evidence Collection and Documentation
                                                                                Physical Evidence Collection: Investigators should gather any materials, equipment, or substances that may have contributed to the incident. This includes items such as faulty tools, broken machine parts, or hazardous materials that were involved in the event. Each item should be carefully documented with details like serial numbers or damage descriptions to help trace the incident's origin.
                                                                                Witness Statements: Witnesses often provide valuable insights into the incident. Statements should be recorded from anyone who saw the event or was involved. To obtain accurate information, investigators should use open-ended questions that allow witnesses to describe the incident in their own words. Investigators should avoid leading questions that could influence responses. Witness statements add context to physical evidence and can reveal situational factors, such as behavioural patterns or environmental
                                                                                Accident investigations follow a structured process to uncover the causes behind incidents, enabling organisations to implement corrective measures and prevent future occurrences. This process involves securing the accident scene, gathering evidence, conducting interviews, and compiling findings into a detailed report.
                                                                        ps in Conducting Accident Investigations Continued
                                                                        Interviewing involved parties is a critical part of the investigation process, as it uncovers details that may not be immediately visible in physical evidence.
                                                                        III. Conducting Effective Interviews
                                                                        Interview Techniques: Effective interviews require a non-judgmental approach to create a comfortable environment for honesty. Investigators should avoid expressing opinions or making assumptions and instead focus on asking open-ended questions to obtain detailed responses. Examples include, "Can you describe what you observed just before the accident?" or "What steps did you take prior to the incident?"
                                                                        Common Pitfalls in Interviews: Bias and assumptions can skew interview findings, leading to inaccurate conclusions. Investigators should avoid asking questions that suggest blame or assume causation, such as "Did you do this?" Instead, they should keep questions neutral, allowing witnesses to recount events without feeling defensive. Additionally, paying attention to non-verbal cues and recording responses accurately are critical for unbiased results.
                                                                        Steps in Conducting Accident Investigations Continued
                                                                        After gathering all relevant evidence, the final stage involves analysing findings to uncover root causes and compiling a comprehensive report.
                                                                        IV. Analysis and Reporting
                                                                            Data Organisation: Evidence, including physical items, photographs, and witness statements, should be systematically organised to create a clear narrative of the incident. This process often involves grouping evidence by timeline or causative factors to identify patterns. Proper data organisation is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions and ensuring the report remains coherent and accessible.
                                                                            Initial Findings and Conclusions: Based on the compiled evidence, investigators can draw preliminary conclusions about what led to the incident. This stage involves identifying any immediate (surface) causes, such as equipment malfunction, as well as deeper root causes, such as lack of maintenance or inadequate training. The findings are then used to create an initial draft report, which outlines the sequence of events, analysis, and recommended corrective actions.
                                                                            Report Compilation: The final report should include a detailed account of the incident, supported by evidence and witness statements. The report should also include root cause analysis, preventive measures, and follow-up recommendations to avoid similar incidents in the future. This document not only serves as an internal resource for safety improvements but also provides essential documentation for regulatory compliance and future safety audits.
                                                                        Root Cause Analysis Techniques
                                                                        Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a structured process that identifies underlying causes of incidents. It ensures organisations address not just the immediate issues but also systemic problems to prevent recurrences. Effective RCA goes beyond superficial fixes, addressing the root issues that allow workplace hazards to persist.
                                                                        Identifying Surface and Root Causes
                                                                        Accurate identification of both surface and root causes is crucial in Root Cause Analysis Techniques Root Cause Analysis (RCA), as it distinguishes between visible symptoms and the deeper issues that give rise to these symptoms.
                                                                        📚Surface vs. Root Cause Differentiation
                                                                        Surface causes refer to the immediate factors that directly led to an incident. For example, a slip-and-fall accident might be attributed to a spilled liquid on the floor (surface cause). However, Root Cause Analysis Techniques Root Cause Analysis (RCA) would probe deeper, uncovering possible root causes, such as inadequate cleaning protocols, poor training on spill response, or insufficient warning signs, which contributed to the spill not being addressed in time.
                                                                        Surface Causes	Root Cause

                                                                        Several methodologies assist in systematically identifying root causes, each suited to different types of incidents and workplace environments. Two commonly used methods are the 5 Whys Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA).
                                                                        Root Cause Analysis Methods (5 Whys Analysis)
                                                                        The 5 Whys method involves asking “why” repeatedly (typically five times) to drill down to the root cause. Each answer leads to the next question, helping uncover the systemic issues behind an incident.
                                                                        ✅ Application: This method is straightforward, making it suitable for incidents with a single causal path. For example, if an employee falls from a ladder, the 5 Whys could reveal inadequate ladder maintenance or lack of safety training as the root cause. The iterative questioning process is particularly effective for exploring less complex issues.
                                                                        ☑️ Limitations: While useful, the 5 Whys can oversimplify complex incidents, as it may not identify multiple contributing factors. It’s essential to use this method in combination with other tools when dealing with multifaceted problems.
                                                                        👉Example: In the case of a machine malfunction:

                                        Power Distribution
                                        Power distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source—either externally from the utility or internally from generators—and then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load. 
                                        In a Critical Operations Infrastructure, power is generally supplied via the local utility substation to the facility at a predetermined and fixed voltage. From there, the power must be harnessed, distributed, and stepped down to various voltages suitable for the customer's critical load, and that's where the various components of the power distribution come in—components including uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), substations, power distribution units (PDUs), electrical switchgear, transformers, circuit breakers, power supply cables, and other equipment that you'll learn more about.
                                        Fig.3.1 - A schematic of power distribution for a site.

                                    PDUS
                                    A power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs— typically in the form of outlets—designed to distribute electrical power to multiple devices. 
                                    Generally a PDU in an A/C circuit is engineered with a power transformer to step down 480VAC to 120/208VAC to provide conditioned power from a centralized UPS or generator to racks and computers of network equipment. A PDU may have the capability to accommodate power supply to multiple equipment racks or server cabinets. 
                                    PDUs vary in design and use, and may be as simple as inexpensive rack-mounted power strips to much larger and expensive floor-mounted machines with complex functions.
                                    Fig. 3.2 - A cabinet PDU, shown with its door open, is designed to support a much larger-scale power distribution system.

                                    Low Voltage vs. Medium Voltage Systems
                                    Click on the following tabs to explore how these systems differ:
                                    Low Voltage
                                    Medium Voltage
                                    In the context of critical environments, low voltage electrical systems are generally categorized as those systems operating at voltages up to 1000 volts (or 1kV). 
                                    Power coming from the utility-source is delivered at a much higher voltage (typically closer to that of a medium voltage system) so it must be stepped down to low voltage, which can be done via a three phase transformer in the low voltage system. 
                                    The low voltage bus (a device in the power system that evaluates the voltage, current, or flow of energy within the system) then distributes this stepped down electrical power to the various loads in the facility, such as IT equipment loads, PDU converters, lighting, and cooling systems.
                                    N.B. Attempting to define low voltage, medium voltage, and high voltage can be tricky because these levels vary depending on specific application guidelines, the context of the application, and sometimes even the electrical parameters that have been determined by the authority having jurisdiction.
                                    Multiple-Source and Multiple-Feed Power
                                    In the ideal situation, the critical facility will be fed from multiple power sources—maybe even more than one power plant. Additionally, the substations, switches, transformers and UPSs within a specific system will influence how electrical power is transferred to and throughout the facility. Dependent upon the design, quantity, placement, and redundancy capabilities of each will define the true meaning of multiple-source or multiple-feed power.
                                    Note: Redundancy refers to the "extra" components of a system that are typically used solely for backup during critical times, like an outage or failure. It will be covered in greater detail in the next topic.
                                    There are four types of multiple-source/multiple-feed power configurations, each with their own distinguishing characteristics:

                                        Single feed/single substation
                                        Multiple feed/single substation
                                        Multiple substation
                                        True dual/multiple feed
                                        Single Feed/Single Substation
                                        In this configuration, a facility is supported by one substation with a single power line and a single input feed to the utility transformer(s). 
                                        Facilities that are supplied power in this manner can be vulnerable to a high risk of failure and critical operations interruption. While it might be supported by multiple transformers (giving it the appearance of backup redundancy), if this single substation and single feed failed to provide power, all equipment downstream would fail as well.
                                        Fig. 3.3

                                    Multiple Substation
                                    In this configuration, there are two power lines (one from each substation), single input feeds to each transformer, and one throw-over switch connecting the two substation outputs. Upon a substation failure, the throw-over switch will manually or automatically transfer to connect to the other substation.
                                    Facilities supported by multiple substations gain the advantage of increased redundancy with limited single point failure opportunities. In this case, the throw-over switch is the most prominent single failure source. Failing to transfer after a substation power interruption will create the necessity for the facility to rotate to an alternative source of electrical generation to maintain the critical load.
                                    Redundancy and Power Supply Transfer
                                    When it comes to providing power to your Critical Operations system, one of the most important things you need to consider is how to ensure that power is always being consistently supplied. As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the concept of redundancy as a method for maintaining stable power and distributing it appropriately throughout your power system and selecting the appropriate scheme for your facility's needs. In this topic, you will identify redundancy levels.
                                    Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 

                                    In the world of Critical Operations, however, the concept of redundancy is much more multi-faceted than the word “extra” implies. How many components of a system have redundancy? Is it just extra capacity or really extra equipment? Does the extra equipment sit idle in standby, or can it be used for non¬critical functions until called upon in the event of a failure? To what extent can a single fault take out the primary component and the redundant component?
                                    Redundancy Levels
                                    Most of the Critical Operations industries are converging towards a common language regarding redundancy and the different variations, or levels, of redundancy. This means a facilities technician can walk from a power plant to a data center to a critical manufacturing facility and understand very quickly what equipment is actually being used out on the floor when the operations manager describes the designed redundancy.
                                    Note: Redundancy levels in regard to mechanical and controls systems have essentially the same meaning as they are described here, in terms of power distribution systems.
                                    These various levels of redundancy include the following:
                                    N 
                                    N+1
                                    2N
                                    2(N+1)
                                    N is to redundancy discussions as the variable “x” is to mathematics: a given or basic number of some thing(s). N redundancy means just that: the basic number of some type of device or equipment (be it generators, UPSs, chillers, etc.) required to support and operate the critical infrastructure. 
                                    In this case, the number of items is more limiting than capacity. For instance, an MCO facility that requires 2 MW of power for its critical infrastructure with a single 5 MW generator is only operating at N redundancy; that same facility is still operating at N redundancy if it uses two 1.5 MW generators because while it has an extra piece of equipment, it is not supporting two times the critical load.
                                    Dual-Cord Supply
                                    When you get down to the level of an individual piece of equipment, redundancy can get a bit tricky. Utilizing a dual-cord supply scheme is the most common approach for high-technology equipment and literally refers to plugging that piece of equipment in twice.
                                    Fig. 3.7 - Rack-mounted servers in a data center utilize dual-cord supplies to provide power redundancy.
                                    When utilizing dual-cord supply, there is a basic method and a preferred method. In almost any piece of equipment, there is usually an internal power supply of some sort behind the power cord connection that takes the supplied power and converts it to what the machine needs to run on (AC vs. DC, a particular voltage, wattage, etc.). The machine will therefore need two of these. 
                                    The basic method to establish redundancy is to have this configuration and plug both cords into the same supply circuit. The preferred method is for each of these cords to be connected to separate power circuits, so that there is redundancy if the machine's power supply component fails, but also if one of the circuits in an MCO system goes down. 
                                    There are two situations where dual-cord supply is important and therefore often implemented: with medical equipment and data center equipment. Medical equipment tops the list of candidates for dual-cord supply, simply because there may be one or more lives at risk. Not all medical equipment is highly sensitive to losing power for fractions of a second, but if a life-support system or surgical device went offline for even a few seconds or minutes, the results could be deadly. 
                                    Additionally, when it comes to complex modern medical technologies, it's not just about how long power is lost, but whether or not the start-up cycle time for that equipment is lengthy enough to have equally terrible consequences. 
                                    Power Supply Transfer
                                    With a strong understanding of the fundamentals of power distribution and redundancy, you can then begin to explore what to do if there is any interruption to the stable power being delivered through the system. In the event of some sort of power outage, having the ability to easily switch between the primary power source and the backup power source is of the utmost importance. 
                                    As a facilities operator, you will need to understand the basics of power supply transfer, including the various components that can be used to perform this important function. In this topic, you will identify the elements of power supply transfer.
                                    Click on the following tabs to explore different kinds of power supply transfers:
                                    Closed Transition Transfer Switch 
                                    Closed transition is a method of switching between two power sources utilizing the “make before break” method of transfer. A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power. If these conditions are met within tolerances, the switch contacts close or “make” with a slight overlap for transfer to prevent any interruption of supplied service. 
                                    Open Transition Transfer Switch
                                    Soft Loading Transfer Switch
                                    Interlocks
                                    Click on the following tabs to learn about interlocks:
                                    Critical Power Interlocks
                                    Trapped Key Interlocks
                                    An interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage. This is achieved by utilizing two circuit breakers that are interlocked so that only one can close at a time. In this manner, an interlock system maintains the critical load during a power outage, while prohibiting the circuit breakers from being powered by two different sources at the same time while connecting to the load. 
                                    In the case of an electrical transfer from utility power to generator, the interlock system will enable a safe disconnect from the utility feed to the emergency generator power without the two sources connecting to each other. This separation eliminates the possibility of electrical back feed which can be extremely dangerous to personnel and cause catastrophic damage to critical equipment.
                                    Note: Trapped Key Interlocks are commonly referred to as Kirk Keys. Kirk Keys are a specific brand of trapped key interlocking systems, but having been around for over a century, many Critical Operations personnel have gotten into the habit of referring to all trapped key interlock systems, regardless of manufacturer, as Kirk Keys. 
                                    Power Distribution Topologies
                                    Now that you know about the concepts of redundancy and the components of power distribution and transfer, it's time to think about how all these components go together to provide the necessary redundancy for your Critical Operations system. 
                                    As a facilities operator, it is important for you to understand the concept of a topology and select the appropriate schema that will successfully support your facility in the event of an emergency. In this topic, you will identify the various power distribution topologies. 
                                    Power Distribution Topology
                                    The topology of systems refers to more than just what is in a system: it focuses on how and why things are laid out and connected the way they are. Specific to power distribution, then, this refers to the specific design of the power distribution system, made in such a manner that it offers the most optimal operations. 
                                    With this in mind, a Critical Operations design may include the best equipment available and extra components for redundancy, but the next step in mitigating risk and ensuring reliability is a well-defined topology that takes into consideration more than just a piece of equipment breaking down. 
                                    Redundancy is only one part of topology reliability designs—we do want extra equipment, after all. Taking steps to protect parts of systems, or other systems, from nearby faults is how we take steps toward higher and higher levels of reliability. In this vein, there are four different topologies or "tiers" of design that are commonly used in power distribution (and that are applicable to other system designs): basic, redundant, concurrent maintainability, and fault tolerant. For simplicity's sake, we'll look at each of these topologies using a single Critical Operation example utilizing generators and associated generator switchgear for distribution, with a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load.
                                    Note: The Uptime Institute—a consortium of companies that oversee the education and certification of enterprise data center professionals—has perhaps the most well-defined and widely recognized system for design topology analysis. The Tier System they have developed has four levels corresponding to the major levels of reliability: Tier I–Basic, Tier II–Redundant, Tier III–Concurrently Maintainable, and Tier IV–Fault Tolerant. A full description of the tier classification system, the tier classifications, and the process for site certification analysis is included in an appendix, reprinted with permission from the Uptime Institute.
                                    Basic Topology
                                    Basic topology for the example facility (generators, associated switchgear, and a desired N + 1 level of redundancy for a 5MW load) gives us just enough to keep things running—perhaps two 2.5 MW generators connected to a single generator switchgear. During a loss of power—while, hopefully, a UPS system is carrying the load—the generators fire up and supply the whole power distribution system from a single connection. While this is better than no back up, for sure, a basic topology is just barely an acceptable option.
                                    Redundant Topology
                                    Given the desired level of N + 1 redundancy when the design allows for it at the example critical facility, you would need at least one extra unit beyond N. Redundant topology for this facility would be three 2.5 MW generators sharing a common connection to the generator switchgear. Upon a loss of power, all three generators would come online to power the facility (most likely, but the logic could call for just two, keeping one in ready standby), but a fault on one unit will still leave sufficient capacity to carry all the critical load. In this manner of thinking, a redundant topology is a good option. 
                                    Fig. 3.11 - A redundant topology.
                                    Fig. 3.10 - A basic topology.
                                    Static Transfer Switch
                                    Concurrently Maintainable Topology
                                    Fig. 3.12 - A concurrently maintainable topology.
                                    Fig. 3.12 - A concurrently maintainable topology.
                                    Concurrently maintainable topology takes it one step further by adding isolation points around the pieces of equipment in a system with redundancy. As the name implies, this allows for maintenance or repair of equipment without taking the entire system out of service. In the Critical Operation example, each of the three generators would certainly have output isolation breakers, but would also have an additional means of separation at the generator switchgear—perhaps additional breaker cubicles that isolate each conductor connection from the switchgear. 
                                    By opening both of those breakers, Critical Operations technicians could safely work on a single unit without compromising the system's ability to fully support its design function (although, redundancy may be affected). Acknowledging notable additional cost, some Critical Operations might push a very rigid view of c
                                    Fault Tolerant Topology
                                    A fault tolerant topology has the most strenuous design considerations put into place; basically referring to a design in which a single fault would not take out an entire system. From a redundancy perspective, we would see 2(N + 1) for all equipment and components in the system. In the Critical Operations example, there would be two sets of three 2.5 MW generators (for a total of six units), with each set having its own separate generator switchgear. The two units would most likely be connected by a normally closed “tie-breaker” between them, with the ability to supply the power distribution system from either end. 

                                    Not only does the Critical Operations team benefit from the aspects of concurrent maintainability, any fault (generator failure, switchgear breaker failure, fault on the switchgear, etc.) only takes out one-half of the system, leaving it with a full N + 1 set of equipment available. In this manner of thinking, the fault tolerant topology is the best option. 
                                    Fig. 3.13 - A fault tolerant topology.
                                    Electrical Protection
                                    As you start to get further into the design of a system's power distribution scheme—including which critical components will be implemented and how they will be implemented—you need to make sure that you have put the proper protections in place to ensure that every component in the electrical system is operating safely. Any amount of electrical voltage could be hazardous to the people or parts in any given facility, but the voltage in a critical facility is exponentially more dangerous. 
                                    As a facility operator, you will need to know what techniques and devices are available to protect your facility's personnel and critical components from dangerous electrical events. In this topic, you will identify and apply electrical protection techniques.
                                    rounding Electrical Equipment
                                    As you may recall, grounding is the process of removing excess electrical charge from a component or system and distributing it to a larger body capable of receiving that charge. When it comes to your power distribution system, grounding is an extremely important concept, especially due to the higher voltages that you may interact with at this level of the distribution chain. 
                                    In addition to grounding measures in place throughout power distribution systems as a whole, individual electrical equipment should have grounding connections whenever possible to mitigate the risk of damage to the equipment during faults and to disperse any excess charge for personnel safety. In many cases, individual pieces of equipment may be connected directly to those larger facility grounding systems. In this situation, it is imperative that these connections are well-documented and well-designed, so that the pathways of lower electrical potential lead to the ground termination and not back to smaller equipment. 
                                    Equipment may also be grounded locally if need be. For example, a PDU may be located in a hall or closet somewhere between the switchgear and the critical load, but not near the installed grounding system. In this case, the PDU may be grounded to a piece of structural building steel, or just a single copper rod sunk into the subfloo
                                    Over-Current Protection
                                    Fig. 3.14 - In over-current protection, a breaker automatically switches to the off position when the power exceeds the level it can support.
                                    Fig. 3.14 - In over-current protection, a breaker automatically switches to the off position when the power exceeds the level it can support.
                                    Over-current protection is likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with: it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe levels. 
                                    This is most often achieved by a breaker tripping or fuse blowing—the exact same thing you've probably experienced in your own home if you overloaded an outlet. A surge of current through the device triggers the interruption, which likely requires a manual reset.
                                    Protective Relays
                                    Protective relays are electromagnetically or electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions. More simply, these are the mechanical devices that open and close breakers in response to undesirable conditions. 
                                    This is generally the means by which breakers are tripped open during protective features such as over-current. Protective relays may also be controlled by logic as part of a response sequence, closing breakers for alternate source after a primary source is tripped due to a fault condition.
                                    Fig. 3.15 - Protective relays used to provide over-current protection at a power generating station.
                                    Surge Protection
                                    Just like you might have a surge protector at home to protect your electronic devices from harmful spikes in the power supply (typically in the form of a surge-protected power strip), Critical Operations need a form of surge protection to do the same for their critical components. 
                                    A Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) is the industrial equivalent to the surge protector power strip your home electronics are plugged into, and provides electrical protection to connected equipment by buffering and absorbing voltage spikes. There are many variants of TVSS systems available to Critical Operations designers, with a wide range of proprietary technologies (usually to protect specific types of equipment or to mitigate specific types of transients (i.e., momentary changes in the voltage). 
                                    The basic concept of surge protection—in addition to the specific protections that individual equipment may have—is to have inline devices throughout the power distribution system that act as energy diverters. When a TVSS module senses a condition for which it is configured, it uses some form of switch to quickly divert part or all of the excess voltage away from the connected load, generally to a ground connection. 
                                    Fig. 3.16 - A TVSS surge protector in a printing and distribution space.
                                    Power Distribution Preventative Measures
                                    Now that you can identify all of the various components of the power distribution system and how to protect them reactively in an emergency event, it is equally important to think about how you can protect them proactively. Preventative maintenance can help ensure that all your critical components are operating safely and effectively, even without the threat of an outage. 

                                    As a facility operator, it is highly likely that your responsibilities will include completing these types of tasks. In this topic, you will identify the preventative maintenance procedures for power distribution
                                    Switchgear Maintenance
                                    Switchgear maintenance involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup, exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular equipment installed. It is generally the most complex, comprehensive, and risk-sensitive preventative maintenance procedures that most critical facilities will experience on their support infrastructure (aside from the more complex maintenance of specialized components such as nuclear reactor refueling, bringing down a satellite tower, moving cryogenic R&D equipment, etc.). 
                                    As it is difficult, and often dangerous, to methodically work through fully de¬energizing switchgear for personnel safety, this maintenance is typically only done once every few years. Critical Operations managers will take advantage of this rare condition to maintain as many components of this critical component as possible on a tight timeline.
                                    Breaker Testing
                                    Breaker testing involves physically inspecting a circuit breaker and subjecting it to as many functional checks as possible. 
                                    This is often accomplished during switchgear maintenance schedules because it is much easier and quicker to remove breakers from de-energized cabinets. One sub¬process of breaker testing is injection testing, in which varying levels of voltage, current, and/or resistance are applied to the breaker in order to check that its protective features respond appropriately. 
                                    Coordination Studies
                                    Breaker coordination studies refer to the analysis of installed breakers, their connected loads, and validating or setting their protective features to operate in proper sequencing. 
                                    For example, breakers that are further down a lineup, and therefore closer to connected load, should generally have lower thresholds or tighter tolerances than those upstream. Similar to selective interlock functions, this allows for isolation of faults closest to the condition, affecting fewer adjacent components. 
                                    Coordination studies should be performed during construction, but are unfortunately not regularly updated with the addition of new equipment. Many Critical Operations, therefore, prefer periodic reviews of the power distribution systems to identify any changes and then adjust settings appropriately.
                                    Exercising Generators
                                    Exercising generators refers to a variety of maintenance activities from short weekly run starts, to load bank tests, to full transfer of connected critical load. It is general best practice to exercise generators to at least a nominal extent on a monthly basis. 
                                    This is a hotly debated topic amongst Critical Operations personnel as there is always some risk. An engine could break during an otherwise innocuous test and inadvertently take a backup power supply away from the facility, or the switchgear could hang up during a full load transfer and force the UPSs to carry the load or cause an outage altogether. With proper equipment-level maintenance, these risks can be minimized, but never prevented. The other side of the argument is: if there is going to be a failure, why not have it during a controlled environment, with competent personnel around, and primary power sources still available? 
                                    The main points from this module are as follows:

                                        Power distribution is the set of electrical transmission systems that receive power from a primary source—either externally from the utility or internally from generators—and then divide it up, pass it through any protective features, and deliver it to the connected equipment load.
                                        A power distribution unit (PDU) is a piece of electrical equipment consisting of multiple outputs— typically in the form of outlets—designed to distribute electrical power to multiple devices.
                                        Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra systems, equipment, or components that may or may not be in service all the time, but provide additional capacity or function to support critical operations in the event of critical equipment failure. 
                                        A closed transition transfer switch (CTTS) utilizes switch logic technology to determine if the subject sources to be connected meet the same criteria for voltage, frequency, and phase relationship between each source of power.
                                        Soft loading is a method of switching between two power sources where a soft loading transfer switch synchronizes and parallels the two independent power sources without the interruption of power, and then transfers the load between the two as it minimizes the momentary variations in the voltage and frequency.
                                        A static transfer switch (STS) utilizes solid state power electronics and silicone controlled rectifiers to transfer power very rapidly without utilizing slower electromechanical means to transfer the power supply.
                                        A soft loading closed transition switch is often utilized to support an automatic transfer of power w
                                            An automatic transfer switch (ATS) automatically transfers electrical power from the primary source (via electromechanical means) to an alternate source such as an emergency generator set.
                                            An interlock is a device or controls function used to prevent a component from causing damage to itself or the system by stopping during a power outage.
                                            Trapped Key Interlock a key is actually trapped inside a cylinder that is part of the breaker itself.
                                            Over-current protection is likely the type of electrical protection that you are familiar with: it's just a means of interrupting the power flow when it exceeds safe levels.
                                            Protective relays are electromagnetically or electronically operated devices that sense conditions and/or receive logic inputs to remotely accomplish protective actions.
                                            Switchgear maintenance involves removing all sources of electrical input to a gear lineup, exercising all moving parts, cleaning, tightening lugs, database maintenance on logic systems, and more, depending upon the particular equipment installed.
                                            Breaker testing involves physically inspecting a circuit breaker and subjecting it to as many functional checks as possible.
                                            Breaker coordination studies refer to the analysis of installed breakers, their connected loads, and validating or setting their protective features to operate in proper sequencing.
                                            Exercising generators refers to a variety of maintenance activities from short weekly run starts, to load bank tests, to full transfer of connected critical load.

                                        Fuel Cells
                                        A fuel cell converts stored chemical energy into electricity using a chemical reaction between positively charged ions and an oxidizing agent. 
                                        Like batteries, they are made up of three segments: the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte; unlike batteries, however, fuel cells require a continuous source of fuel and air to operate. In a fuel cell, the chemical reaction occurs where the three segments interface, such that the fuel is consumed, water or other gases are created as a waste product, and an electric current is produced. As long as the sources are supplied, the fuel cell will continue to produce electrical energy. 
                                        The most common and familiar type of fuel cell is likely the hydrogen fuel cell, which requires hydrogen (H2) fuel and air (O2) as the sources. During the chemical reaction at the segments, some O2 molecules are stripped from the air and some are stripped from the water (H2O) molecules, leaving more H2 to act as fuel. In the end, the remaining broken-apart, ionized hydrogen (H+) and oxygen molecules re-combine to form water as the waste product (which is, unfortunately, non-potable).
                                        Fuel cells have been making inroads in several industries—notably, transportation and propulsion, in addition to power generation—due to their capability to make renewable, mostly clean energy (wastewater being the one downfall). For large-scale implementations, fuel cells can be an expensive capital investment but have relatively low cost of operation. Power density is approaching that of traditional diesel/gas generators, so Critical Operations of any size would still require a small array of fuel cells, but they can provide continuous power more indefinitely than generators.
                                        Fig. 2.19 - A schematic of a hydrogen fuel cell shows how energy is created from the chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen.
                                        Wind Power
                                        Wind power also ranks very highly as a clean, sustainable alternative energy source. Wind turbines are simply large fans that convert the mechanical energy of the wind to electricity by turning the rotor of a standard generator. These are highly efficient machines as virtually the only source of energy loss is overcoming friction in turning the rotor.
                                        Fig. 2.21 - Wind turbines on a wind farm in Idaho. In 2011, wind power generated 8% of the state's total electricity.

                                        Biomass is a broad term encompassing virtually all renewable, organic materials—from old wood pallets, to discarded crops, to “municipal waste” as the dictionary gently puts it—that can be treated in some manner (shredded, compressed, composted, etc.) and burned for fuel. Then, just like most other power plants, the heat is generally used to drive steam or gas turbines to create electricity.

                                        Supercapacitors
                                        Capacitors, specifically electrochemical capacitors, are another category of energy storage devices, typically used on smaller scales than batteries. They can store very small amounts of electric potential. 
                                        For example, think about the minuscule amount of charge it takes for an electronic device to keep track of time. The battery on your phone may have died, or your computer may have been unplugged for weeks, and yet when you connect to a primary power source and boot it up; it still knows what time it is. 
                                        Capacitance—the ability to store some amount of charge—is measured in a unit called the farad (named for the acclaimed 19th century English scientist Michael Faraday). 
                                        Fig. 2.23
                                        Co-Generated Power
                                        In a co-generated power system, some fuel source (nuclear, coal, gas, biomass, etc.) is used to create steam for turbine generators, and then the leftover heat is extracted from the exhausted waste steam (or condensate) and is used to provide power for other central services (such as space heating or water heating). 
                                        Co-generation plants are an economical, if not thrifty, alternative power source that is primarily found in campus settings because of the ability to utilize the co-generated energy to power a central service for multiple buildings on the site, if not the entire campus. 
                                        While it is still not common for most Critical Operations facilities to be generating their own primary power on site (with a few large-scale exceptions), the co-generation concept is one that facilility technicians and operators are finding great success in implementing after the fact. Anything that generates heat can be considered a candidate for co-generation. 
                                        For instance, a communications center that finally decides to install a solar array on the roof could then install a bypass loop to its hot water heater and run tubes within or behind the array to collect its heat. Or machinery with compressors or motors in a manufacturing plant could be hooded in some manner, and ductwork could be put in place to pump the hot air back into people spaces during colder months to augment installed electric heater
                                        The main points from this module are as follows:

                                            Electricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles.
                                            Voltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them.
                                            A volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity.
                                            Low voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels.
                                            Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
                                            High voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers.
                                            Electrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire.
                                            Amperes, represented by the shortened term amps or the letter A, is the unit of measure for expressing the flow rate of an electric charge, or current.

                                                The plastic raw material used in 3D printing is widely available and is not expensive.
                                                PLA stands for Poly-Lactic Acid – It is biodegradable.
                                                When 3D printing the plastic filament must be heated by the printer before it is extruded onto the printer build plate.

                                                • X axis
                                                • Y axis
                                                • Z axis
                                                When 3D printing it is critical that the printed object stays attached to the printer's base to avoid defects in the printed object.
                                                Oil can be used to coat the plastic filament and helps it move smoothly through the extruder nozzle of the 3D printer

                                                            Lesson Summary
                                                                At the visual studio installation, you can select the different features that you would like such as Visual C++ and Visual F# to cater to the type of project you are creating.
                                                                Errors are shown in the error list. You can select an error in this list and you will automatically be brought to the line of code where the error is present.
                                                                It is important that you have accurate spelling when you are writing your code as wrong spelling may result in errors in your code.
                                                                You cannot write your code wherever you like as writing your code in different places can have different outcomes.
                                                                Indentation can be used to make code easier to read and relate codes together. Indentation will not affect the way your code appears when you run the project.
                                                                Visual studio will automatically add colour to certain aspects of code to help the readability of code.
                                                                Code is defined inside a code block. You define a code block by inserting 'sub' or 'function' followed by 'end sub' or 'end function'. Alternatively, you can type 'module' followed by 'end module'. Your code should appear between these.
                                                                It is important to place your message within double quotation marks in your code
                                                                Lesson Summary
                                                                    Project templates provide a great starting point for different types of applications that you want to build.
                                                                    The solution explorer is an important feature of visual studio as it is the main navigational device to the other files and settings that comprise a program.
                                                                    By default, visual studio saves projects in the current user's documents folder on their computer.
                                                                    Visual studio is the preferred way to open an .sin file.
                                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                                        Statements in visual basic are like thoughts or complete sentences. Statements are made up of one or more expressions and in turn an expression is made up of operators and operands.
                                                                        An operand is similar to a noun in a sentence such as a variable. 
                                                                        Operators are like verbs and will act on the noun.
                                                                        You can pause and watch the execution of each line of code by setting a stop sign or break point in your code. This allows you to execute your code and when you get to that break point, you can continue to step through the code line by line or continue on to execute the rest of the lines of code.
                                                                        An array is a grouping or a collection of data.
                                                                        Creating methods help us to better organise our code and eliminates duplicating code.

                                                                    Camel casing can be used to distinguish when one word begins, and another ends.

                                            Lesson Summary

                                                The string data type can hold a lot of information, therefore working with strings is a vital skill in visual basic.
                                                You can figure out how to manipulate the string to make it exactly the way you want using the built-in functions in visual studio.
                                                It is recommended that you should always use the correct visual basic verbiage rather than relying on the visual basic shortcuts to prevent problems from occurring.

                                                Lesson Summary
                                                    The codes that you write in your methods are ultimately defining the classes of your application. Every method that you use from the .NET framework class library is just a class and that's why it's part of the class library.
                                                    Every time you create a new instance of a class, you have a new object that is distinct and separate from the other instances of that class. It lives on its own.
                                                    You can create many instances of a single class by giving each instance of a class a different identifier, so it is distinct from every other item based on the same class in the computer's memory.
                                                    The .NET framework run-time keeps the memory region clear and gets rid of stuff it no longer needs. It does this by counting references or counting how many handles you are actually holding on to.
                                                    You can create a variable that can hold a reference but you don't have to create a new reference necessarily, you can just copy the reference from another object. Once variables go out of scope then those variable's values are no longer accessible.
                                                    There are a number of methods in the .NET framework class library that you don't have access to because they are hidden behind the private accessibility modifier

                                                Lesson Summary
                                                    The framework class library is so large that its developers split it up into multiple files. These library code files are called assemblies.
                                                    All the classes and methods are split up into different assemblies. When you create your own projects, you are creating the basis for a dot net assembly as well.
                                                    There are two kinds of assembly, an executable assembly and a library assembly.
                                                    MyNamespace is great for getting information about the current computer that you are running on, working with files and folders on the computer, working with command line arguments into your command window application, and working with configuration files.
                                                    In larger projects, you might want to keep multiple projects into the same solution when there are somewhat related.
                                                    Reference counting refers to how many references are still attached to a given object.
                                                    The dot net framework will count the references, if the count is zero then it will remove that object from memory.
                                                    Whenever you declare a variable inside of a block of code, that variable is only alive and accessible from the life of that block of code. This means that whenever that code has finished executing, the variable defined inside of that block of code is no longer accessible, its values are disposed of by the dot net framework run time.
                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                        Generic collections are called so because you have to define the type for the collection to make it specific.
                                                        When we create a new item in our dictionary, we must give it a key and a value. A key is similar to a word in a normal English dictionary while a value is similar to a description of a word in an English dictionary.
                                                        You can index into the dictionary by supplying the key to get a specific instance of the entire object.
                                                        Using multiple curly braces can be confusing. But you can select a curly brace and whichever curly brace you have selected, visual studio will show its corresponding beginning or ending brace by highlighting the brace in grey.
                                                        By using the And keyword, you're able to add additional filtering criteria in a link query.
                                                        Enumeration is a data type that limits and constraints all possible values to only those that are valid for an application.
                                                        Lesson Summary
                                                            Compilation errors can be fixed before a user releases the application to others.
                                                            You should always code defensively through the try catch end try statements in visual basics.
                                                            When you release an application to the end user, ensure you are accounting for all the potential problems that may arise.
                                                            You should strive to examine every part of your application that relies on some exterior resource that is not directly in your control as a developer. You should then apply the Try Catch Finally' judiciously in those parts of your application that you cannot control.
                                                            Event-driven programming is at the heart of most of Microsoft presentation API's whether you are building web or windows applications.
                                                            Events allow you, as a developer, to plug in and respond by handling key moments or events in the life cycle of an application's execution.
                                                            An object will declare an event, the developer can then attach code or add handlers to the various events that are raised by objects and write any custom code in response to them events.
                                                            We can take control of adding or removing event handlers to specific events by using the add handler and remove handler keywords and pointing them to the address of methods that we implement in our source code.

The code uses a microcontroller to receive the decoded incoming IR data and use this data to control any device. The IR sensor receives the signal and gives it to our microcontroller.

                                                A relay is a simple electrically operated control switch that is made up of an electromagnet and one or more sets of contacts. It is commonly used to control the high current circuit path by using a low control voltage.
                                                Fixed and movable contacts are important components of an electromagnetic relay. The contacts of the relay are used to break one electrical connection and make another electrical connection when the relay is energized.
                                                Contactors are used in the control schematics of electrical systems. The contactor has power contacts as well as auxiliary contacts for required operations.
                                                The Auxiliary relay used in the control circuit once energised changes its contacts position (i.e) from NO to NC and from NC to NO. When the relay is de-energized, it gets reset in different ways. 
                                                Auxiliary Relays are used for control, monitoring and multiplication etc., along with switching logic. A monitoring relay is a device that is used to receive input signals, monitor and determine them, and sends an alarm signal if a threshold value is attained.
                                                Timer helps in controlling a sequence of operations in a system. There are different types of timers based on the principle of operation; Examples: electro-magnetic timers, pneumatic timers, static timers etc.
                                                Relays used in electrical systems require some additional arrangements to operate efficiently. Most of the monitoring relays are latch-in relays or electrical reset relays.
                                                The control voltage of the relay is classified into pick-up voltage and drop-off voltage based on the operation performed by the relay. In general, the pickup value should not be less than 75% and the drop out value should not be more than 15% to 20% of the rated voltage.
                                                Under voltage relays and over-voltage relays are used to monitor the voltage of a bus, a line, generator etc., If the voltage exceeds or lowers the preset value in the monitoring system, these relays will pick up or drop out accordingly. Thus, these relays play a vital role in protecting a system or a devic

                                                A circuit breaker is an electrical switch designed to connect or disconnect an electrical installation from the Source Power/Voltage.
                                                The closing and tripping command has to be given to the circuit breaker when needed. The control circuit provides the sequence of operations that have to be performed for closing or tripping the circuit breaker.
                                                A circuit breaker is an electrical switch that controls an electrical circuit containing loads. With the help of commands from the protective devices of the load or the supply system, it helps to isolate the load circuit from the supply system at the shortest possible time. 
                                                In general, a control circuit helps to perform ON/OFF operations and to protect the electrical system during fault conditions.
                                                Troubleshooting is needed to improve and maintain complex systems. Malfunctioning of a system has to be identified first for troubleshooting.
                                                The tripping control circuit is an important part of the normal opening/tripping of a circuit breaker. It helps to open the circuit when needed and to protect the controlled equipment as well as the electrical system during various fault conditions. 
                                                A circuit breaker is an electrical switch that is used to make and break electrical connections. The tripping circuit scheme operates with help of command signals from operating personal and also from the protective devices of the load or the supply system. 
                                                All breakers have closing and tripping circuits for their operation. The trip circuit helps in protecting the system under service from faults by tripping the breaker. Thus it plays a vital protective operation.
                                                The trip circuit must be healthy at all times for its effective operation. Thus to monitor the trip circuit's healthiness, trip circuit supervision is done.

                                            What are Critical Operations?
                                            Critical Operations are just that—actions, processes, and systems that enable the execution of the integral functions of a business or organization. Simply put, the litmus test to identify Critical Operations can be: if this "thing"—a specific task, process, or system—broke or stopped working, would this hinder or cripple the continued ability of the organization to meet its goals?
                                            Critical Operations are classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics. For instance, the emergency generator at an air traffic control tower is absolutely mission critical, whereas a backup generator for your local sporting goods store is not. The consequences of the same component failing are vastly different: the loss of the former during a power outage poses a tremendous, imminent threat to the safe landing of airplanes, but the loss of the latter during a power outage will probably only result in the store closing early and losing some sales. The two are simply not comparable in the severity of their impact.
                                            There are some systems and processes that are fairly unique to Critical Operations because they create reliability and safety for the systems and processes crucial to the success of the larger entity. Regardless of how commonplace or unique the component may be, Critical Operations are united by the fact they are the fundamental building blocks that allow an organization to deliver a service with little or no possibility for error, downtime, or any other type of interruption.

                                            Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or service.
                                            Non-physical items such as specific procedures or safety programs might be considered characteristics of the critical infrastructure of critical operations, but in this sense, critical infrastructure focuses on the physical pieces of equipment that make up the critical operations system, including systems networks.
                                            A threat is anything that can potentially cause damage or harm to a person or object. A threat can be environmental in nature, the result of faulty equipment, or human-created in the form of accidents, negligence, or nefarious activities. 
                                            Considering the possible threats posed to the people, property, or systems within a critical facility is an important part of both the design and implementation of critical operations. Within reason, you should always assess the potential threats to critical operations and plan for as many as is practical. This is equally important in design, construction, and day-to-day sustained operations within a facility.

                                            In a critical facility, there is almost never a single piece of equipment—or even one, stand-alone system—that constitutes the whole of the facility’s critical operations. Therefore, it is important to understand the concept of a system as a set of interconnected "things" or components that come together to form a more complex whole. A fundamental building block of critical operations is simply understanding that these components, in any combination, come together to create a more complicated system that serves a mission critical purpose. 
                                            Within a facility, these various systems work together to perform critical functions and are often connected to each other, via design and/or their operators, by various systems of process and procedure. More often than not, the critical operations within a critical facility include the following systems.

                                            Safety and Security
                                            Controls
                                            Critical power systems cover an immense spectrum of designs and components, but really only fulfill two purposes: delivering power to equipment performing critical tasks or distribute power from generation sources. 
                                            There are five key elements of Critical Operations that tie together the various systems that make up the mission critical environment. These elements include:

                                            It is part of a broader category of Information Technology (IT), which is the broad application of computer devices and other communications equipment that are used to deliver, receive, and store data or other types of information.

                                            Security refers to the application of devices and procedures to ensure that a valuable asset—whether an object, a person, a facility, or even information—is protected from harm. For Critical Operations, security can be grouped into three main areas of focus: protecting people (safety), protecting equipment (physical design), and protecting information (processes and procedures).

                                            Procedures and Policies
                                            Procedures are specifically prescribed means for accomplishing tasks in a reliable and safe manner. Policies are guidelines that direct actions or activities, generally needed to ensure similar outcomes are achieved given a wide array of possible inputs and variables. 
                                            Another way to think of the distinction is that policies govern our thoughts and the boundaries for related actions, while procedures are designed to specific sets or sequences of actions required to assure a predicted result.

                                            Documentation
                                            Documentation is a collection of documents that are relevant to a specific topic, whether that is an object, process, or any other specific subject. Documentation often includes user manuals, procedure checklists, reference guides, and so forth, and can be in hard copy (or paper) or electronic form.
                                             
                                            In a perfect world, documentation should exist—and be easily accessible—for every component of the critical system and for every possible process, policy, or procedure. This includes documents about the system design, installation, and operation specifications, instructions, and material history for all of the various components of the system and facility.

                                            Crises
                                            A crisis is any event or occurrence, typically happening abruptly or with little or no warning, that has the potential to result in an unstable or dangerous environment. 
                                            Crises can take on many forms and require specific responses, depending upon their nature. A natural disaster and the threat of imminent system failure are of equal concern. For the sake of identification and planning, it is important to categorize the different types of crises and how to address them. 

                                                A threat is any natural or man-made occurrence, individual, entity, or action that has or indicates the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property.
                                                An incident is any occurrence, caused by either human action or natural phenomena, that may cause harm and that may require action. 
                                                An attack is any malicious activity by outside individuals directed at a specific target. 
                                                Crisis Management
                                                Of all the in-depth planning and design that goes into bringing a critical installation online, and as skilled as its operators may be, emergency situations still arise—it's inevitable. Hence, the necessity for crisis management: the planning and monitoring for and the immediate response to any potential threat.
                                                It is vital to have well-thought-out crisis management plans that operations teams are trained on and comfortable with. Writing scripts for every possible scenario is highly impractical, if not impossible, but consistent plans to respond to situations, to establish a path towards stability, and to connect the right resources will be invaluable in the event of a crisis. 
                                                Accelerated Decision Time Frame 
                                                With incidents occurring in real time, quick decisions provide windows of opportunity to stop an event or at least mitigate damages from spiraling out of control. Crisis management leaders must think on their feet and be confident enough in prior planning efforts to execute response activities so that they lose as little time as possible. 

                                            Phases of Crisis Management
                                            In the event of a crisis, there are three phases of crisis management that are typically followed: 

                                                Crisis Assessment - The right problem needs to be addressed and it needs to be fixed. Plans and procedures should be followed to determine things like: How did this begin? Are there other conditions (e.g., alarms, faults, etc.) that we're not seeing? What resources are available? And, what is the status of all our systems? 
                                                Crisis Action Plan - With answers to the preceding questions, the crisis management leader should begin to enact and/or develop action plans. This spans the range from completing triage activities, to incident notification protocols, to marshaling resources for permanent repairs, to establishing the level of sensitivity or urgency under which these actions are to take place. Depending upon the environment, formal crisis response activities may continue on until every single fault or failure is addressed, whereas other facilities simply want to restore operations, even under temporary conditions, and document the go-forward plan. 
                                                Crisis Termination - Again, putting a stop to the crisis response varies by industry and application, but generally falls into the two approaches just mentioned: maintain the crisis response posture until all systems, equipment, and operations are fully restored or repaired, or release this posture once the threat to operational availability has been neutralized and the crisis leadership is comfortable with the documented remediation plans
                                                ritical Industries
                                                As a Facilities Operator, it is imperative that you know all of the organizations that are part of the critical infrastructure, especially those that are inherently interconnected.  According to U.S. national policy created to "strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure," there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors. 

                                                Use this policy as a guideline to understand critical infrastructure in whatever nation you may reside in:

                                                    The Chemical Sector consists of five segments based largely on what final products they produce, each of which has unique characteristics, markets, development opportunities and, accordingly, respective areas of issue. These five segments are: 
                                                        Basic chemicals

                                                        Commercial Facilities Sector
                                                        The Commercial Facilities Sector consists of any facility that operates within the sphere of open public access, which means that the general public can easily enter and move about in the facility's space without the presence of security barriers. Typically, these facilities require unfettered access to the general public because they provide a commercial service or product to them. They fall into one of eight subsectors: 
                                                            Public Assembly (such as arenas, stadiums, zoos/aquariums, museums, convention centers, etc.) 
                                                            Sports Leagues (such as professional sports leagues or other organizations)
                                                            Gaming (such as casinos) 
                                                            Lodging (such as hotels, motels, conference centers, etc.)

                                                            Real Estate (such as office buildings, apartment buildings, condominiums, mixed-use facilities, storage facilities, etc.) 
                                                            Retail (such as retail centers or districts, shopping malls, etc.)
                                                            Communications Sector
                                                            The Communications Sector is an integral part of the entire critical infrastructure of a nation, since so many other sectors rely heavily upon it. This sector, in particular, has changed significantly over the past two or three decades, as communications technology has quickly evolved: where it used to be primarily concerned with voice services, it now includes terrestrial, satellite, and wireless transmission systems. And, more so, these various transmission types have become interconnected, working together to provide seamless, end-to-end transmissions across different communication media. 

                                                            Today, many providers will share their facilities and technologies to ensure that there is interoperability among the different transmission mediums.

                                                    Water and Wastewater Systems Sector
                                                    Critical Manufacturing Sector
                                                    The Critical Manufacturing Sector is another sector that can be considered crucial to the continued, uninterrupted functioning of some of the other critical infrastructure sectors because the products that they manufacture are directly used—if not essential to—the operations of the others. 
                                                    This sector consists of four broad categories of industries that manufacture critical components: 
                                                        Primary Metal Manufacturing—including iron, steel, and ferro alloy manufacturing, alumina/ aluminum production and processing, and nonferrous metal production and processing. 
                                                        Machinery Manufacturing—including engine, turbine, and power transmission equipment manufacturing. 
                                                        Electrical Equipment, Appliance, and Component Manufacturing—including electrical equipment manufacturing. 
                                                        Transportation Equipment Manufacturing—including vehicle manufacturing, aviation and aerospace product and parts manufacturing, and railroad rolling stock
                                                        ams Sector
                                                        FIg. 1.7
                                                        FIg. 1.7
                                                        The Dams Sector is another critical component of a nation's critical infrastructure. The Dams Sector consists of a number of different types of dam-related assets, including dams, locks, levees and dikes, hurricane barriers, hydropower generation facilities, and a host of other water containment or control facilities. The facilities or organizations that fall within the Dams Sector provide services with a wide range of benefits, including water supply and waste management, flood control, waterway navigation, natural wildlife habitats, and even recreation. 
                                                        These services also extend to some of the other critical infrastructure sectors—such as providing a source of water for the Food and Agriculture Sector—creating strong interdependencies between the Dams Sector and these other sector

                                            efense Industrial Base Sector
                                            The Defense Industrial Base Sector is a complex collection of industries that supports the research and development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons, parts, and other components for a nation's military, including products and services that are necessary for mobilizing, deploying, and maintaining military operations.
                                            Financial Services Sector
                                            The Financial Services Sector consists of the wide variety of institutions that provide financial products and services to individual consumers, businesses, and the other critical infrastructure sectors. These activities include depositing funds, making payments between parties, providing credit to consumers, investing funds, and transferring financial risk between parties. 
                                            As technology has become more prevalent in the financial industries, this sector has become more vulnerable to newer security risks including power emergencies, the effects of natural disasters on IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity threats.
                                            Emergency Services Sector
                                            The Emergency Services Sector (ESS) serves as a nation's primary defense in regard to the prevention of and remediation of risk resulting from both man-made and natural incidences. In addition to protecting an entire nation in the event of an emergency, it also carries the heavy burden of serving as the first line of defense for the remaining critical infrastructure sectors. 
                                            This includes a wide array of response functions in an emergency, but primarily it is responsible for protecting people, property, and the environment; providing assistance to those affected by the emergency event; and providing recovery services and aid to those impacted by the event. 
                                            These emergency response actions are the responsibility of five broad categories of emergency responders: 

                                                Law enforcement
                                                Public works
                                                Fire and emergency services
                                                Emergency medical services
                                                Emergency management services
                                                Within the ESS, there are also a number of specialized organizations that provide specific services in the event of an emergency of various types, including: 
                                                    Public Safety Answering Points (such as emergency telephone call center responders)
                                                    Tactical Operations (such as S.W.A.T or Emergency Response Units)
                                                    Search and Rescue
                                                    Aviation Services (such as police or medical helicopters)
                                                    Hazardous Materials
                                                    Energy Sector
                                                    The Energy Sector has been labeled "uniquely critical" by DHS because the products and services it provides directly support the critical functioning of the other critical infrastructure sectors. The sector is divided into three interconnected segments, including:
                                                        Electricity (which is produced by combusting coal, combusting natural gas, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric plants, or renewable power sources) 
                                                        Petroleum 
                                                        Natural Gas 
                                                    Almost every critical sector relies on some form of energy produced by the Energy Sector industries, making it both incredibly important but also incredibly vulnerable to threats. 
                                                    Food and Agriculture Sector
                                                    The Food and Agriculture Sector consists of those industries producing and providing food-related products or services to the nation, including:
                                                        Farms
                                                        Restuarants
                                                        Government Facilities Sector
                                                        The Government Facilities Sector consists of a number of government-owned and operated buildings, some of which are publicly accessible and some that are open to approved personnel only. Those that are open to the public include buildings used for business, commercial, or even recreational purposes; those that are not open to the public typically house sensitive information or materials, including government-used office buildings, courthouses, embassies, laboratories, or any other structure that might be home to critical equipment or systems. 
                                                        The Government Facilities Sector is also responsible for utilizing cyber technology to protect government assets, including information and personnel, that are critical to government functions. 
                                                        Healthcare and Public Health Sector
                                                        The Healthcare and Public Health Sector is responsible for protecting the public from all sorts of risks to their health, including terrorism, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and other natural disasters. These responsibilities are both proactive, in the form of providing preventative healthcare options; and reactive, in the form of providing healthcare response and recovery actions in an emergency event. 
                                                        The healthcare component of these services is typically delivered and managed at the local level via private industries or state-run programs, while the public health component is typically managed across all government levels.
                                                        Manufacturing, processing, and storage facilities
                                                    Explosive Ordinance Disposal (such as a bomb squad)

                                            The main points from this module are as follows:

                                                A Critical Operation is classified as such because of their functions within an integral system, not their standalone characteristics.
                                                Critical infrastructure refers to the physical systems that are put together that allow a facility to fulfill its purpose in delivering an important product or services.

                                            Critical Infrastructure sectors include:

                                                Power Fundamentals
                                                When you think of the term "power," you may think first of the utility lines that provide us with the energy needed to keep the lights and your electronic devices powered on and working. And, as you know, power is one of the utilities necessary for keeping Critical Operations up and running. But what you may not know are the fundamental concepts of power: what power is and how it works. 
                                                Electricity
                                                Electricity is most simply defined as a form of energy resulting from either the static accumulation of charged particles or the flow of charged particles. The electricity that is most relevant to the discussion of power and power sources is the latter, known as current electricity since it flows between objects or places. A good analogy for this kind of electricity is water in a hose: when the water is turned on, pressure is applied to the water at one end of the hose and pushes it out the other end. Electricity works similarly: electrically charged particles flow from one end—say, a power generator—and come out on the other end—perhaps the lights in your house.
                                                But electricity is also a concept that encompasses all aspects about the accumulation or flow of electric charge, from the quality and volume of energy transferred to the manner in which it reacts with different components. The best way to learn about electricity is from the bottom up: beginning with the characteristics of the flowing electrons (speed & volume); the different means of measuring electric charge; and some of the most common components, or building blocks, or electrical systems.

                                            Critical Systems That Rely on Constant Availability of Power
                                            There are very few purely mechanical systems in use today that do not require some sort of electrical power. It is, therefore, possible to state that all critical systems in Critical Operations rely upon electrical power. The degree, however, to which equipment needs constant availability of power, or a certain quality of power is a differentiating factor. 
                                            Some systems are energy hogs but are not highly sensitive to ebbs and flows in the power supply, while some other systems use only a small amount of electricity but have little or no tolerance for any fluctuation in the quality of power supplied. 
                                            One example of a critical system that relies on the constant availability of power would be a computer-based system, like a data center, in which the components are highly sensitive to a constant supply of electricity at a specific voltage. The concern here is that any interruption, no matter how momentary, can cause a hiccup in the function of a delicate high-speed motor component, which would then cause ripple effects throughout other Critical Operations. Loss of data or continuity of data are both a great concern for all the electronic and digitally controlled systems in place today. 
                                            The other form of Critical Operation electrical systems particularly concerned with the constant availability of power are those with complex or extended start-up cycle times. 
                                            Plenty of Critical Operations have sufficient tolerance or backup plans to handle a system going offline for a few seconds or a minute; for instance, an emergency communications/command center could temporarily allow data to be routed elsewhere and rely upon the most recent information or view information from another location to continue making decisions and move operations forward. 
                                            But, bringing all of these systems back online, in the proper sequence and with the proper security considerations in place, might actually take hours or days to complete. In this case, those two seconds of power drop begin to cripple Critical Operations for an extended period of time.

                                            Voltage
                                            Voltage is the potential difference in electrical energy (or charge) between two points, which correlates more plainly to the speed that electrons flow through this charge or the amount of pressure pushing or pulling them. 
                                            Volts
                                            A volt, represented by the letter V, is both the unit of measure most commonly used to express voltage, as well as being an aspect of flowing electricity. 
                                            Fig 2.2

                                            Think of it this way: conceptually, it is like both the speed limit of a roadway and the actual speed of the cars traveling on that roadway. The speed limit on Interstate 5 is 70 mph whether or not there are vehicles on the road going 70 mph; in the same manner, a 12V flashlight is still a 12V flashlight whether it is turned on or off. 
                                            Systems are designed to operate at specific voltages, but are not always restricted to that voltage. However, that specific voltage needs to be supplied as consistently as possible to allow the system to operate properly but not running too far outside of optimal operations and potentially causing damage; in the roadway example, this would be establishing a speed limit that allows for the efficient travel of all the commuters on the road, but prevents dangerous speeds that potentially result in loss of control, accidents, or wrecks.
                                            Low Voltage
                                            Low voltage equipment or systems can be loosely categorized as those that operate or are capable of operating below regular residential voltage levels. There are actually many technical definitions of what constitutes a low voltage system that vary by industry and country; for example, in the US, a low voltage system is one operating at 100V or less. 
                                            Some examples of common low voltage systems are included in the following tabs:
                                            Control Circuits
                                            Voice Circuits
                                            Network/Data Circuits
                                            Wiring circuits for building and equipment controls systems run at a multitude of voltages and tend to vary most with the age of the system or facility. In newer installations (within the last decade or two), you will most frequently run across 24V controls systems. Voltage is dictated by the types of components and controllers on the circuits, but the trend is moving towards standardization to increase the commonality of repair parts (wiring harnesses, power modules, backup batteries, etc.). 
                                            You may also see or hear controls circuits referred to as signal wiring, particularly in international settings. 
                                            Medium Voltage 
                                            Medium voltage is the most loosely defined across industry standards, but generally refers to any system operating at equipment voltage levels, which includes everything from 110/120V (the voltage of a typical wall outlet circuit) up to 1 kilovolt (KV). 
                                            Operators working in Critical Operations should be most concerned about the medium voltage systems in their day-to-day tasks, primarily due to the various levels of specified protective equipment and safety regulations required to operate and maintain the power components within a medium voltage system. In this case, dedicated safety and technical training is required, but stops short of needing a full electrical license or advanced preparations.

                                            The following tabs includes some examples of common voltages falling within the medium voltage range and their common applications:
                                            110/120V
                                            • Wall outlets
                                            • Corded tools/equipment (i.e., window fans)
                                            220/240V

                                            Especially in the Critical Operations industry, high voltage commonly refers to those systems operating between 1 kilovolt and 15 kilovolts, which is generally limited to the utility supply equipment, such as switchgears, generators, transformers, and main distribution breakers. Some large-scale manufacturing or power generation systems may have high voltage components inside the facility, downstream of the utility supply and backup power systems, but they will be highly specialized to the location 
                                            Live high voltage circuits are incredibly dangerous to work around since there is no protective gear in existence that can protect an operator from the hazards associated with an electrical fault. Operators and technicians rarely perform maintenance on these systems as it is left to utility electricians or specialty contractors due to the infrequency of operation and the levels of knowledge required to do so safely. However, protective gear should be worn even when operating breakers and switches at these voltages with the housings fully closed.

                                            Current
                                            Electrical current, represented by the letter I in scientific equations, is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, typically carried by charged electrons moving along a wire. Current takes into account both the volume of electrons in the circuit and the speed in which they are moving, which is the circuit's voltage. 
                                            Amperes
                                            Amperes, represented by the shortened term amps or the letter A, is the unit of measure for expressing the flow rate of an electric charge, or current. Scientifically speaking, one ampere is equal to the current flowing in two parallel wires, one meter apart, producing a force of 2x10-7 newtons per meter. Current, expressed in amps, is measured by using an instrument called an ammeter.

                                            Power
                                            Power measures the work done (or the potential work that can be done) by electricity. Specifically, power is the rate at which a given amount of energy is transferred through an electrical circuit. The power of a system can be calculated using the simplified equation, power = voltage x current. 
                                            Power Factor
                                            In a real, operating electrical system, there are many components that are influenced by their environment that create inefficiencies. So how do you bridge the gap between ideal physics and real-world function?
                                            By using the power factor, a concept generally calculated indirectly as the ratio of real power (the amount of energy actually available or used) to apparent power (the potential power purely available in an ideal system with no losses). A power factor of 1.0 in a system is referred to as a "unity" and represents perfect condition

                                            Alternating Current

                                            Illustration of a Alternating Current
                                            Direct current (DC) is a constant flow of electricity that travels in one direction. It is the "original" type of electrical power, or that which is produced by batteries. In a DC system, both voltage and current are constant, and there is another variable at play: resistance, which is the innate property of most conductors that creates opposition to the passage of an electrical current. Resistance is measured in ohms, represented by the symbol Ω, named after the German physicist who discovered this property.
                                            Single-Phase Power versus Three-Phase Power
                                            Single-Phase Power
                                            Three-Phase Power
                                            Single-phase power is a specific type of AC power distribution where a single conductor carries one waveform of current, or multiple conductors carry multiple currents with matching waveforms. A single-phase AC power supply does not create a magnetic field in the motor it is connected to, and therefore needs additional circuits to start the motor. 
                                            For this reason, single-phase power is the most common power distribution scheme for residential and light duty commercial environments, which use few large motors or no motors at all.

                                            A transformer is an electrical device that changes voltage in an AC circuit—either increasing it or decreasing it—by varying the current flowing through the conductor's internal wires using a process called electromagnetic induction. Basically, it manipulates the characteristics of the rotating electromagnetic fields that create AC power in the first place, in order to “step up” or “step down” the AC voltage supplied. Most commonly, transformers are used to reduce the voltage as it works its way down through the electrical distribution system from high

                                            A watt is the global standard for measuring electrical power and has a value of one joule per second. One watt is not a tremendous amount of energy, so you may often encounter the measurement of a kilowatt—or 1,000 watts.

                                            Generator-Provided Power
                                            While utility-based power is the optimal source of electrical power for Critical Operations, there will always be a need for a backup power supply. For this, generator-provided power is the most common source of backup energy. But, of course, there are many types of backup generators and fuels that can be used to power them, and different types of system components to safely switch between the two sources of power. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it will be vitally important for you to have a strong working knowledge of generator-provided power and how to integrate this source of backup power into your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the different types of generator-provided power and the system components used to implement them saf
                                            There are different types of generators that are rated for use in certain situations, based on their size and function. The intended use within Critical Operationss typically guides which type of generator is the best fit for a system. 
                                            Click on the following tabs to learn about the various types of generator-sets:
                                            Stand-By 
                                            Continuous
                                            Prime Power
                                            Stand-by generator sets are exactly as the name implies: purely backup systems. These engines are off, in a normal state, but fully operational and waiting on a start command to fire up and power Critical Operations.  Stand-by generators may be required to operate for extended periods of time in large emergencies, but ideally only need to run for a few hours during a utility outage. Typically, a stand-by generator will have some more rugged components installed, such as heavy-duty starters and starting batteries, pre-lubrication pumps, and jacket water heaters, so as to be able to start immediately during any condition.
                                            Fuel Types
                                            Traditionally, the prime mover for a generator set is an internal combustion engine. An internal combustion engine can run on a variety of fuel types, with diesel, fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas being the most common engine fuels in use. 
                                            However, there are some pros and cons to evaluate when considering what type of engine/fuel type is best for Critical Operations. Click on the following tabs to explore:
                                            Diesel
                                            Fuel Oil
                                            Gasoline
                                            Natural Gas
                                            The term "diesel fuel" is the commonly accepted shorthand for off-road diesel #2, a particular type of petroleum-based fuel that is not the same as the “highway use” diesel you might fill up your truck with. Diesel #2 is a particular grade of refinement that would not meet the emissions requirements for use on roadways in most states. It is also usually colored with a red dye to denote its off-road use. Utilizes the heat and pressure created by compression as its means of starting. 
                                            Pros:
                                            •      Most common and reliable engine type, and is therefore widely available. 

                                            Cons:
                                            • Larger minimum engine size. 
                                            • Concerns regarding emissions. 
                                            • Potential issues with cold-starts. 
                                            Automatic Transfer Switches
                                            An automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a particularly helpful component that acts as an independent traffic director of sorts, to ensure that power is being supplied from the most optimal source available. While ATSs exist in many places throughout Critical Operations installations, ATSs at the main utility input are of unique importance since they perform a few extra duties. 
                                            Think of an ATS as a “Y” gate, with the top of the Y connecting to two different power sources; in this case, the utility-source and the generator. The bottom of the Y heads off to whatever load is being supported. The ATS has two main parts: a control panel and the switch. The control panel is always monitoring power quality signals from both sources and is programmed to have a primary and alternate source. 
                                            Fig. 2-13: A diagram of an automatic transfer switch (ATS).
                                            Throw-Over Switches
                                            A throw-over switch, or manual transfer switch, serves the same purpose as an ATS, but without the automatic control features. Some switches still have control panels that will provide an alert or alarm when conditions reach set thresholds, although they will require an operator to physically make the transfer.
                                            Paralleling Switchgear
                                            Paralleling switchgear are large devices comprised of electrical disconnects, fuses, circuit breakers, and other electrical instruments used to transfer the electrical load from the utility-source to the generators (and vice versa) and then appropriately distribute the electrical power throughout the system. Specifically, they are used to switch the power source for the load, provide load sharing capabilities, operate the generator, meter the output, and protect the generator from any potential malfunctions.

                                            Uninterruptible Power Supplies
                                            By now, you have a strong understanding of the two main types of power that can be provided to your Critical Operations: the consistent power supplied from the utility-source and the backup power supplied from a generator. These are likely the two sources you are most familiar with, just from day-to-day use; you may have even used a generator before to supply power to your own home. But, there is another source of backup power that is a commonly-used, critical component of any Critical Operation: an uninterruptible power supply. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it is imperative that you understand the purpose of an uninterruptible power supply and be able to choose between the different types that are available in order to best serve your Critical Operations. In this topic, you will identify the types of uninterruptible power supplie
                                            UPS
                                            An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device or machine that provides immediate emergency power when the primary power source fails, using electrical energy stored within the device itself. UPSs are a critical component of a Critical Operations power system because they are designed to provide clean and continuous power to Critical Operations during power interruptions and eliminate abnormal fluctuations from the power source as delivered.
                                            Electricity delivered from the utility power source is never “clean power,” often experiencing spikes, sags, and occasional interruptions. These power abnormalities can wreak havoc on the IT load and other critical equipment serving Critical Operations and even severely damage them. UPSs protect these systems by providing temporary backup power for brief outages and absorbing those spikes and sags, ensuring the power delivered is within acceptable tolerances and specification for critical consumption. UPSs are not designed to sustain power supply for long periods of time, but rather long enough to engage another alternative source of power, such as a power generator, to accept the electrical load. 
                                            UPSs vary in design and method of application, but the basic function of a UPS follows the same principle. A UPS accepts AC power from the provided source, stores a portion of the energy in a backup battery system, and delivers the remaining to the critical connected equipment. In order to perform this vital function, the UPS requires three key components: a charger/rectifier, a battery or other storage mechanism (typically, a flywheel), and an inverter. The charger/rectifier converts the input AC power to DC power for battery charging, and the inverter converts the battery power to AC power during a power interruption.
                                            Flywheels
                                            As an alternative to a battery system, flywheels can be used with a UPS to support continuous power requirements. A flywheel is a mechanical-type storage device that stores energy kinetically by rotating a mass around an axis. The electrical input spins the flywheel rotor up to speed where it remains fully charged in stand-by mode, 24/7, until a power interruption requires its activation. When this occurs, the flywheel provides back-up power immediately, while the system monitors for proper electrical input. If this condition persists for a specified time frame measured in seconds, the system transfers to a more permanent power source such as the backup generator system. 
                                            This technology is relatively cost-effective and environmentally friendly as opposed to the traditional lead acid battery system. Although the initial cost of batteries is relatively low, the cost of maintaining, replacing, and disposing of batteries over the long term must be taken into consideration. Flywheel technology can also work alongside a battery system if desired, and is highly effective at absorbing the abnormal electrical inputs as the first line of defense, thus prolonging the life of the storage batteries.
                                            Line Interactive UPS
                                            A line interactive UPS combines the inverter and charger in the power supply line to supply both the AC power and the backup battery power and is capable of regulating its output voltage by utilizing a transformer or "buck-boost" circuit. 
                                            This system limits transient voltages when switching and increases the speed of the changeover from main power to backup battery power. Because of this design, a line inverter UPS does not have to resort to batteries as often as other systems; instead, it utilizes some of its battery power only to support the transition from normal mode to voltage regulation mode.
                                            Fig. 2.16 - A schematic of a line interactive UPS, showing how it operates (or doesn't operate)at various levels of voltage.
                                            Load Bus Synchronization
                                            Load Bus Synchronization (LBS) is an engineering method to keep the output of two independent UPSs in sync, even if they are operating from two different sources of supplied power. In general, a UPS in a multiple-UPS system will automatically sync to its own bypass source, as long as all of the UPSs are tied to the same input source. However, imagine if these UPSs were operating off of different back-up generators, batteries, or another bypass source. In these scenarios, their outputs will always tend to drift out of sync and cause problems within the electrical load. 
                                            The LBS system functions by continuously monitoring the sync reference signals of two UPS modules. It remains in a dormant state until the output of the UPS modules drift out of predetermined operational parameters—or out of sync—at which point the LBS activates and manipulates the output of each UPS module until they once again fall in sync with each other. Once completed, the LBS once again returns to its dormant state of operati
                                            Batteries
                                            So far, the sources of power you have learned about are typically used on a larger scale, providing power to a whole system or the large components within it. When it comes to providing power to smaller devices or equipment (or, sometimes, even a secondary source of power), batteries are a familiar and typical solution; however, not all batteries are best suited for use in a Critical Operation environment. 
                                            As a facilities operator, you will need to be able to differentiate between the different types of batteries and select the one that is best for your particular Critical Operation’s needs.

                                            Lead Acid Batteries
                                            Lead acid batteries are widely prevalent and come in many options available for commercial/ industrial scale usage in MCOs. In a lead acid battery, the positive terminal is made of lead-oxide (PbO2), the negative terminal is made of lead (Pb), and the electrolyte solution that fills the container is some concentration of sulfuric-acid (H2SO4). The chemical reaction amongst the three components produces the voltage for the battery. 
                                            Flooded wet cell batteries are the original form of lead acid batteries and simply have the cathode and anode fully submerged in the electrolyte solution. The top of the battery is covered, with the terminals protruding for connection, and two ports: a vent and a fill port. As part of the chemical reaction releasing and storing energy in the battery, the acid (in this case, H2SO4) and some water (H2O) molecules are broken apart, releasing hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gasses. This gas needs to be vented in order to prevent over-pressurization of the battery, hence the need for the vent. Some of the solution can also evaporate over time, so to maintain the cathode and anode fully submerged, de-ionized water may need to be added to the jar from time to time. 
                                            Valve Regulated Lead Acid batteries (VRLA) are an advancement of lead-acid battery technology and have been in wide use for decades now. This battery design utilizes a specialized one-way pressure release valve, only releasing gasses when pressure is actually beginning to rise to certain levels (whereas the flooded wet cell tends to release most all gas produced). By forcing the gasses to stay within the jar, they become re-absorbed by the solution, attach to the cathode and/or anode, and through ionic exchange reactions, form water again. This is a process commonly referred to as recombinant technology and delivers two main benefits: increased safety protection from over-pressurization and/or dangerous gas release, as well as virtually eliminating the need to ever refill a jar.
                                            Utility-Source Power
                                            The next important concept to discuss, once you understand the fundamentals of power, is where power comes from. There are a myriad of energy sources in use today, and that list keeps growing as old sources fall out of fashion and new sources are discovered or developed. Of these sources, utility-source power is one of the most common sources of energy and the one you are probably most familiar with since you see it and use it on a daily basis. 
                                            As a facilities operation professional, you will need to know where your power comes from and understand the nuances of how and how much power comes into your Critical Operations facility from the source. In this topic, you will identify utility-based sources of power.
                                            he following tabs to explore the most common sources that provide utility power:
                                            Coal
                                            Coal-fueled power generation plants supply about half the electricity in the United States. Coal is the original fossil fuel and receives the most press regarding the environmental impact of its use. It is formed over long periods of time as geological processes build up over layers of biological material—mostly plants. Coal is extracted from the earth via mining. 
                                            The basic concept for creating power from coal is common to most electricity generation plants: create a heat source to turn water into pressurized steam which may then transmit mechanical energy to a turbine. The rotation of the turbine may directly, or indirectly, spin the rotor of a generator set.

                                            High vs. Medium Voltage Systems

                                            When discussing utility supply power levels, there is some difficulty in clearly quantifying power levels, particularly the upper and lower boundaries for medium voltage systems. For the purposes of grid connections, let's just consider the utility supply lines at the point where Critical Operations take ownership; the voltage at that location will determine what other substation and transformer equipment Critical Operations need, and perhaps most critically, the backup power source.
                                            Some Critical Operations take the full 100+ kVA supply from the utility main transmission line and have large substations onsite. Some take power from the utility that's been stepped down once to something closer to 12-15kVA but also have generators that operate at that same level, so the final step-down happens inside the facility, regardless of where the power is being supplied from. Still others take power that's been fully reduced to site operating levels (typically 480V) via a utility reducing station and a “campus” reducing station, and then also run their generators at this voltage.
                                            Microgrids
                                            A microgrid is a small-scale, localized utility-source system that can disconnect from the larger, more traditional utility-source grid (i.e., the public or privately-owned power plants and distribution centers) either partially or completely. A microgrid can operate autonomously, providing its own generation, storage, and transmission of electrical energy, though typically at a low voltage. In this way, it is an excellent source of both small-scale energy production and a powerful backup option for any interruptions to the power provided by the larger utility-source grid. 
                                            With all this in mind, you may think that any Critical Operations with a backup power source would be considered a microgrid, but that's not entirely accurate. This is particularly relevant in a campus setting, where the backup power will be the supply for multiple loads, both critical and non-critical, and needs to be able do so for an extended period of time. 
                                            Additionally, using only a petro-fuel based generator as the sole source of power, without the support of the main utility grid, is limited by how much fuel storage is onsite (and subsequently, how often fuel deliveries would be required). A true microgrid setup is going to have some kind of co-generation plant and/or standalone power plant such as biomass, solar, or wind power.

                                            ternative Power Sources
                                            Most of the power sources you are familiar with are the more traditional types, such as utility-supplied or battery-supplied. These days, there are more alternative energy sources available as we look to find clean, renewable options for power. As the technology improves, these alternative power sources are becoming more available and prevalent in both residential and commercial implementations—including Critical Operations. 
                                            As a facilities operator, it will benefit you to be aware of these alternative power sources and be prepared to potentially interact with them in a Critical Operations facility. In this topic, you will identify alternative sources of power.

                                                    Defining Rapid Learning
                                                    Rapid learning, also known as fast-paced learning, is the acquisition of new knowledge or skills quickly and efficiently. Thus, rapid learning accelerates the process of acquiring knowledge and skills compared to traditional learning methods. When teachers use rapid learning principles to help students grasp new knowledge, develop skills quickly and retain them efficiently, it can help them bridge their learning gaps or accelerate learning.
                                                    It is one of those methods that can help students with learning gaps and other students generally. When a class of students are said to have learning gaps, it means that there are disparities in knowledge and skills that exist among these students, often resulting from differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs. 

                                                    Such students are to be provided with targeted interventions and support to bridge these gaps and help them catch up to grade-level expectations. An example of such intervention is remediation. Remediation, which is a dimension of rapid learning, entails personalized strategies such as targeted assessments, small group instruction and tutoring to address learning gaps and help students catch up.

                                                    Remediation
                                                    Remediation is specifically used to close learning gaps or for overcoming academic challenges, such as in mastering prior knowledge and concepts in struggling students, while accelerated learning, another dimension of rapid learning, is used to foster fast and efficient learning for students who are doing well already and want to learn faster say, in preparation for an exam.
                                                    Remediation can have two different approaches. Traditional remediation or simply remediation and rapid remediation.  Rapid remediation is a more focused and time-sensitive approach than traditional remediation. It aims to quickly close learning gaps or deficits in a specific area so that students can catch up with their peers or meet specific academic goals. It also entails more intensive support. 
                                                    It is important to know that although all rapid learning processes can significantly help students learn faster and more efficiently, they, however, don’t guarantee mastery of the subject, as achieving true mastery will likely require extensive practice, application of knowledge, and a deep understanding of the subject matter. Rapid learning can be an essential step in the learning process, but it's usually just one component on the path to mastery.
                                                    Rapid Remediation
                                                    Rapid remediation often employs targeted interventions and concentrated instruction. It may use specialized techniques and resources to speed up the learning process. It is flexible and adaptable. As students make rapid progress, the level of support may be adjusted to align with their evolving needs.  Educators involved in rapid remediation may need to receive specialized training to enhance their ability to provide efficient and effective support.
                                                    Collaboration among educators, specialists, parents, and students is essential to ensure a coordinated effort to close learning gaps rapidly. Some of the features of rapid remediation include a defined timeline, specific goals and a sense of urgency. It is typically used when preparing students for upcoming assessments or bringing them up to grade level within a short period. It entails pushing the student to grasp concepts at a faster pace than the student is used to.

                                                    The key idea behind rapid remediation is to intervene swiftly, provide the most targeted support possible, and expedite students' progress toward grade-level or curriculum standards. It's particularly important for preventing long-term learning gaps and helping students get back on track quickly.  If you're looking for an approach that swiftly closes learning gaps, rapid remediation would be the choice. If you're emphasizing a more comprehensive, gradual process for closing learning gaps, then remediation is the appropriate course.

                                                What Are the Principles of Rapid Learning?

                                                 Learning gaps refer to disparities in knowledge and skills among students due to differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs. In providing rapid learning, uncovering learning gaps is important, and it involves looking into what students can't do and what they can do. 
                                                We uncover these learning gaps through diagnostic assessments, formative assessments, or teacher observations. Learning gaps identify areas where individual students need additional support - that is, what they know, what they don't know or haven't mastered and for which they need additional support. There are instances, where students who could easily succeed don't because of a learning gap, and this can negatively affect them now and in the future.
                                                Thus, teachers need to uncover individual student's learning gaps to prevent skill gaps that could affect the student's confidence and impede student achievement and also to promote educational equity. When learning gaps are uncovered at any point in time, the teacher should provide personalized instruction and support such as remediation or rapid remediation. 
                                                Applying Rapid Learning
                                                 Here are some examples of the applications of rapid learning in education and personal development:
                                                Exam Preparation
                                                From the time a student starts to prepare for important exams, rapid learning can help in fostering quick and efficient learning and in selecting the best and most efficient resources and materials needed to guarantee passing the exams.

                                                Lesson Summary
                                                In this module, you have learned that:

                                                    Rapid learning, also known as fast-paced learning is the acquisition of new knowledge or skills quickly and efficiently. 
                                                    Remediation, a dimension of rapid learning, is specifically used to close learning gaps or to overcome academic challenges, such as in mastering prior knowledge and concepts in struggling students.
                                                    Rapid remediation typically has a defined timeline and specific goals, and a sense of urgency, such as preparing students for upcoming assessments or bringing them up to grade level within a short period.
                                                    Learning gaps refer to disparities in knowledge and skills among students due to differences in prior learning experiences, instructional gaps, or individual learning needs.
                                                    Achievement gaps are disparities in academic performance or achievement levels between different groups of students, such as between white students and black students or between children of the rich and children of the poor.
                                                    By using the diagnosis of learning gaps as a foundation, educators can design learning objectives.
                                                    Rapid learning can be applied in education and personal development.
                                                    To better appreciate the importance of rapid learning, it is important to understand the dimensions of rapid learning.
                                                    Learning Outcomes
                                                    Having completed this module, you will be able to:
                                                        Outline the eleven-step process of closing learning gaps through remediation.
                                                        Recall that clear and achievable objectives for the remediation process are crucial for guiding and measuring progress.
                                                        Evaluate appropriate strategies for remediation based on defined objectives, ensuring alignment and effectiveness.
                                                        Apply active learning strategies to engage students holistically in the learning experience, moving beyond the passive reception of information.
                                                        Identify spaced practice as a valuable strategy that entails revisiting and reviewing previously learned material at intervals to enhance retention and understanding.
                                                        Outline the process of providing effective feedback and reinforcement, which includes constructive guidance, recognition of achievements, and addressing misconceptions.
                                                        Describe the qu
                                                        Preliminary Phase for an Effective Remediation
                                                        Closing learning gaps through remediation has to follow eleven steps which are categorized in three phases - the preliminary phase, the core phase and the final phase. 

                                                        The preliminary phase contains just four steps. These steps are important for assessing the situation and guaranteeing effective remediation. The challenge for many teachers is to make the right choices and decisions in the preliminary phase because the steps greatly determine the outcome of the remediation process.
                                                        The Four Steps of the Preliminary Phase
                                                            Assessment and diagnosis
                                                            Defining clear objectives for remediation
                                                            Choosing appropriate strategies based on the objectives
                                                            Choosing appropriate learning and teaching resources and materials
                                                        ick follow-up step in remediation with precision, including conducting regular follow-up sessions, ongoing assessments, and adaptive strategy adjustments.

                                                The Core Phase for Effective Remediation
                                                This core phase has a distinctive set of characteristics. The core phase has the students doing most of the work, unlike the preliminary phase, where you do all the work. In addition to this, the core phase is where most of the teaching and learning occurs in the entire remediation process.
                                                The core phase acknowledges the teacher as a dynamic leader, firmly grounded and respected by students. The teacher must motivate and engage the students to accelerate their learning and achieve their educational goals effectively.
                                                There are five steps in the core phase:

                                                    Active Learning
                                                    Immediate Practice
                                                    Feedback and Reinforcement
                                                    Recap and Summarize
                                                    Homework for Immediate Applicatio

                                                The Final Phase
                                                The final phase signifies the end of the remediation process if the learning gaps have been closed. Otherwise, it's more accurate to think of it as a transition phase. It then serves as a phase that is designed to guarantee continuous development. Let's delve into this phase and its significance:
                                                The final phase is designed for evaluation and collaboration for sustainability. The evaluation in the final phase often involves assessing the effectiveness of the remediation strategies that have been implemented. Adjustments can be made to the strategies, learning objectives, or resources used. If the strategies have proven highly effective, they can be reinforced or continued by the students, parents, and even the teacher who is overseeing the process. 
                                                Conversely, if some strategies haven't yielded the desired results, they can be modified or replaced in preparation for another cycle of remediation to improve the overall outcomes. And, of course, all these are documented to inform future decisions and adaptations. Also, support from parents, guardians, or support networks is crucial in this phase for sustainability. Collaborating with these stakeholders can particularly play a pivotal role in maintaining and furthering the student's development.

                                                    Closing learning gaps through remediation involves eleven steps from start to finish.
                                                    In examining the student, it is important that we use all available tools and resources for the diagnosis and assessment, as this can help us detect patterns in student difficulties.
                                                    Defining clear objectives for remediation is one of the most important steps in the entire remediation process.
                                                    Effective remediation depends on our choices of strategies based on the objectives.
                                                    In the core phase, the students do most of the work, unlike in the preliminary phase, where you do all the work.
                                                    Engaging students via active learning engagement entails involving students in the entire learning experience, not just in listening to what is being taught.
                                                    Revisiting and reviewing previously learned material at intervals over weeks or months or spaced practice is a valuable strategy in remediation.
                                                    In the remediation process, feedback and reinforcement encompass several elements, including offering constructive guidance, acknowledging achievements, addressing misconceptions, and encouraging practice.
                                                    The quick follow-up step in the remediation process involves three key featu

                                                        Choosing appropriate learning and teaching resources and materials

                                                The Core Phase
                                                The core phase in a rapid remediation process is a critical phase that shifts from the intensive diagnosis and initial planning to active engagement and implementation of targeted strategies. The purpose of the core phase is to provide student-centered learning in line with the identified critical objectives.
                                                The critical phase is a more hands-on phase, where the student is actively engaged and learning, and It's a pivotal phase toward achieving the rapid results that are the hallmark of a rapid remediation approach to closing learning gaps.
                                                More specifically, the core phase is designed to extensively close learning gaps and also help students achieve mastery of the subject matter. In this phase, students are empowered to acquire knowledge and skills fast in a way that guarantees that they can apply the same knowledge and skills effectively.
                                                Quick Follow-up
                                                Follow-ups are essential to track the effectiveness of the remediation process, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that students continue to progress toward their learning objectives. They provide a structured approach to ongoing improvement and success:

                                                    Objectives: The process begins with analyzing the well-defined learning objectives to measure progress.
                                                    Assessment: It evaluates the assessments that were conducted and how well students met these objectives. 
                                                    Feedback Loop: Constructive feedback is provided to students based on findings in 1 and 2 above.
                                                    Adjustments: You may need to fine-tune existing methods, introduce new ones, or offer additional support to address identified challenges.
                                                    Individualized Support: In situations where more than one student is involved, one may need to provide individualized support, which could include tailored exercises, one-on-one sessions, or access to specialized resources. This personalized approach ensures that each student's unique needs are addressed.

                                                Day Trading is about taking positions that you do not carry overnight.

                                                        Lesson Summary
                                                        The key points from this module are:
                                                        The idea behind the Extreme Directionless Candle (EDC) Strategy is to identify inter-day market situations which point to extreme directionlessness in the market and then try to capture a small inter-day directional move that might emerge for this situation. There are two indicators of the EDC Strategy.
                                                            Average Directional Index (ADX): This is used to determine the strength of a trend.
                                                            Average True Range (ATR): This is a measure of market volatility. It is used to measure the average movement in prices over a period.
                                                        The rules of the EDC Strategy are to identify a candle for which the ADX goes below 25 (EDC Candle) which will tell the trader that the market has reached an extreme directionless state. You will initiate a Long position if prices go above EDC Candle high first and stop below EDC candle low. You will initiate a Short position if prices go below EDC Candle low first and stop below EDC candle high.
                                                        An Inside Bar Pattern is a candle with a high price lower than the previous candle and a low price higher than the previous candle.
                                                        The Complex Trading Strategy is trading by combining the NR$4 candle with the Inside Bar Pattern. You will be trading only those NR4 Candles that are also inside bars.
                                                        In the Complete Trading Strategy, you identify NR4 candles that are also Inside Bars, you will initiate a buy trade if prices break above this candle's high first and sell if prices break below this candle's low first.

                                                            Introduction
                                                            The word "employment law" refers to all elements of employment. It might refer to anything from your contract to anti-discrimination and anti-unfair dismissal legislation. The purpose of employment law is to govern the interaction between employers and employees. Both employers and employees may guarantee that their recruiting and dismissing procedures, as well as their workplace as a whole, are fair to everyone by following appropriate regulations. Employment law also aids in the fight against discrimination and the successful promotion of workplace equality.
                                                            While employment laws in the United States benefit employers, the contrary is true in the United Kingdom, where regulations support employee protection. Governmental models have an impact on how employment regulations are drafted. The Equality Act 2010 and parental leave rights are two examples of employment regulations in the United Kingdom that match those in other 
                                                            European nations as a condition of the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union (EU). Some of these laws resemble those of the United States. For example, the Equality Act of 2010 contains protections for gender reassignment and civil unions, in addition to the same protected groups as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In this study, we will highlight the employment law of the USA and UK in detail.

                                                        What Does Employment Law Cover?
                                                        Employment law is a broad field of law that covers a wide range of issues that arise in the workplace, primarily guiding processes and policies that you might implement. Because employment law covers such a broad variety of topics, a comprehensive description of all the areas where it applies would take up a whole page. 
                                                        Employment contracts, equal pay, holiday entitlement and pay, working hours, grievance procedures, disciplinary procedures, maternity and paternity leave, various types of discrimination, equality and diversity in the workplace, reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities, the redundancy process, and much more are some of the most common areas that you'll likely come into contact with as a business owner
                                                        USA Legal Framework of Employment Law
                                                        In the United States, most employment agreements are assumed to be 'at will,' which implies that an employer can fire an employee at any time and for any reason, as long as the cause isn't illegal. An employee in an at-will employment relationship has the same freedom to leave at any time and for any reason.
                                                        With or without a documented employment agreement, an employment relationship can be created. Individual written employment agreements are mainly limited to executive-level workers in the United States, while collective bargaining agreements may cover other employment arrangements.
                                                        Written employment agreements usually include provisions addressing the employment term, salary and other compensation (such as bonuses), benefits, job responsibilities, ownership of work product (work for hire), termination, dispute resolution processes, and how the employment contract may be renewed or amended. Restrictive covenants, which prevent the parties from performing particular acts during the employment term or for a time after termination, may be included in these agreements
                                                        USA Legal Framework of Employment Law
                                                        The United States, being a common law and federal country with fifty (50) states and many city governments, lacks a single set of codified labor and employment rules that apply to all companies. Rather, the regulations that govern job relationships come from a variety of contexts.

                                                        Court rulings
                                                        Federal laws control employment relationships in the United States and apply to all employers who engage in interstate commerce. They establish minimum employment standards and rights. Wages, hours, medical leaves of absence, discrimination, trade unions and bargaining with trade unions, mass layoffs, and plant closures are all covered by federal statutes. Furthermore, immigration and work permits are applicable to all employers which are governed by federal law; regardless of size or industry.

                                                        Factors for the Safeguards of Federal Employees
                                                        The US Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing around 180 federal labor laws. Also, the Fair Labor Standards Act created a federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour; however individual states may have chosen a higher rate. On the other hand, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in charge of enforcing workplace safety rules (OSHA). Unemployment insurance benefits are provided through a combined federal-state program that is financed by a payroll levy on employees and employers. To secure the protection for the employees there is U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which works to secure the rights of the citizen in respect of employment. Here are eight important factors for the safeguards of the federal employees
                                                        The Minimum Wage and Medical Insurance
                                                        The Minimum Wage
                                                        Medical Insurance
                                                        The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) assures that all American workers be paid at least the federal minimum wage. Most private and governmental firms have been required to pay employees at least $7.25 per hour since 2009; however some politicians have attempted to increase that figure. In addition, the FLSA guarantees that nonexempt employees will be paid time and a half for any overtime they work. 
                                                        Minors are also given particular safeguards under the law. It restricts the amount of hours that minors under the age of 16 can work in non-agricultural jobs. Furthermore, the FLSA forbids employers from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for certain high-risk positions.
                                                        Safety in the Workplace
                                                        The 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act went a great way in reducing workplace risks in the United States. Several specialized safety regulations were included in the Act, including construction, marine, and agricultural industry-specific rules. A "General Duty Clause" is also included in the legislation, which forbids any working conduct that poses a demonstrable risk to employees. 
                                                        The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in charge of enforcing the legislation, however, state agencies may be involved in some aspects. Self-employed people and those who work on small family farms, for example, are free from the rule, despite the fact that most workers benefit from it. President Joe Biden requested OSHA to establish an emergency interim regulation on September 9, 2021, requiring firms to comply with certain requirements.
                                                        The Social Security Administration
                                                        In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, creating a financial safety net for elderly and handicapped Americans. About 55.6 million people received Social Security checks each month as of July 2021 (the most recent figures available as of early September), with an average amount of $1,543 for retirees and $1,277 for citizens with disabilities. These benefits are paid for by a payroll tax, which may appear on your pay stub as "OASDI." Employers and workers each contribute 6.2 per cent of a staff member's yearly salary, up to a maximum annual contribution. Self-employed people pay the entire cost of the tax, which amounts to 12.4% of their earnings; 50% of the amount is tax-exempted.

                                                         Whistleblowers
                                                        Family Leave
                                                        Despite the fact that each state has its own unemployment insurance agency, unemployment benefits are provided through a federal-state partnership. States are in charge of unemployment compensation, but they must adhere to strict federal criteria. Individuals must have been jobless for causes beyond their control—for example, a layoff or termination—and must fulfil state-specific principles to be eligible for benefits. Workers can get benefits for up to 26 weeks in most situations; however, payments are occasionally extended during economic downturns. The unemployment system in the United States assures that Americans have at least a few months of security when they temporarily quit working, albeit it is not as generous as in certain European nations. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, President Biden's American Rescue Plan extends federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week until September 6, 2021.
                                                        iscrimination in the Workplace
                                                        The Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked a turning point in American social justice, particularly in the area of employment. Businesses could no longer discriminate on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which was passed 45 years later, improved workplace rights by outlawing salary discrimination against women and minorities. The Supreme Court decided on June 15, 2020, in Bostock vs. Clayton County, Georgia, that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act's anti-discrimination provisions protect LGBTQ workers. 
                                                        "Today, we must consider whether an employer can dismiss someone solely for being homosexual or transgender," wrote by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. The solution is obvious. An employer who terminates a person for being homosexual or transgender does so for features or acts that it would not question in someone of the opposite sex. Title VII prevents sex from playing an essential and undisguised part in the decision. 
                                                        The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which applies to employees 40 years and older, and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 are two more federal labor laws that safeguard against workplace inequity (A
                                                        Employee Rights in the UK
                                                        The employment status of an employee determines their rights. Several variables can influence this:

                                                            The nature of the job
                                                            Payment options
                                                            Who is responsible for paying your taxes?

                                                        Under the legislation, there are three primary forms of job status. Employees are individuals who have an employment contract, whereas workers are those who have a service contract. On the other hand, Self-employed people include business proprietors, freelancers, and contractors.
                                                        Keeping track of important employment laws in the UK is a wonderful method to stay on top of them. The essential aspects of employment law are encapsulated in a core collection of legislation. It is significantly less probable to disobey these rules and obligations as an employer if you are reminded of them on a frequent basis
                                                        Employee Rights in the UK
                                                        The most important pieces of employment law legislation, as well as critical information about these laws, are included here.
                                                        Employment Rights Act
                                                        Employment Rights Act of 1996 (ERA): This legislation, which replaces an older Labour Law, protects employees' rights in situations such as dismissal, unfair termination, paternity leave, maternity benefits, and redundancy.
                                                        The National Minimum Wage
                                                        Employment Relations Act
                                                        Maternity and Parental Leave
                                                        Must Receive a Pay Slip
                                                        A pay slip should be issued on or before the day you are paid. It must include a full breakdown of your salary for the appropriate time period, as well as any deductions such as taxation and National insurance. Your company has the option of providing pay slips on paper or electronically. A payslip for an employee must include the following information:

                                                            Total pay before and after deductions (the gross amount and net amount respectively) Variable deductions, which vary based on the amount of money you earn.
                                                            Variable deductions include tax, national insurance, student loan repayments, and pension contributions. Deductions that are predetermined. These can also be mentioned in a separate statement that must be put out before the first pay slip is issued and updated annually.
                                                             Your tax code may be included on your pay slip
                                                            No Discrimination
                                                            When someone is treated unjustly at work because of traits protected by the Equality Act 2010, this is known as discrimination. The rights of the employees that are protected are Age, Disability, Gender reassignment, Marriage or civil partnership, Pregnancy or maternity, Race and Religion or belief.
                                                            Direct Discrimination
                                                            Indirect Discrimination
                                                            When someone is treated unfairly because of a protected feature, this is known as direct discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs when rules that apply to a group of employees or applicants are reasonable in theory but less fair to a specific protected characteristic in practice. For example, if a pregnant woman was absent due to morning sickness and an employer used this as justification for disciplinary action against her attendance record, this would be direct discrimination.
                                                            Discrimination
                                                            However, discrimination can be justified in some cases, which is known as objective justification. For example, if a surgeon's eyesight has worsened to the extent that they are unable to do surgeries, the surgeon's employer would be justified in modifying the surgeon's responsibilities to safeguard patients. 
                                                            If you believe you are being discriminated against at work, then you can determine if you are covered by the law or determine whether your employer is accountable; and determine the type of discrimination that applies to your circumstance (there may be more than one situation). After that, you may determine what steps to follow and whether or not to seek legal guidance.
                                                            Health and Safety Regulations
                                                            Employers are required under the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) to create a safe and healthy working environment for their workers. This involves providing toilets, wash basins, and clean drinking water, as well as keeping the workplace clean, ventilated, and properly illuminated, as well as maintaining any equipment utilized.
                                                            Sick Pay Is a Legal Requirement:
                                                            Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) of £95.85 per week is available to eligible employees. You must have:
                                                                Worked for your company
                                                                Earned an average of at least £120 per week before tax
                                                                Been sick, self-isolating, or shielding for at least four days consecutively (including non-working days)
                                                            SSP is available for up to 28 weeks. The number of days you can get depends on why you're not working. You can earn SSP during the period mentioned in the letter urging you to shield from coronavirus if you're shielding against corona virus. If you have to self-isolate and are unable to work from home, you can collect SSP for every day. To qualify, you must self-isolate for at least four days. Unless you're sick for a reason other than coronavirus, you can start getting SSP on the fourth day of your absence. The three days preceding this are known as "waiting days," and you can only be compensated for them if you got SSP within the previous eight weeks, which included a three-day waiting per
                                                            Maternity Leave and Pay
                                                            Maternity Leave 
                                                            Maternity Pay
                                                            Employees have the option of taking 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave. Ordinary Maternity Leave is defined as the first 26 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. Additional Maternity Leave is the last 26 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. You do not need to complete all 52 weeks. You must, however, take two weeks off following the birth of your child, or four weeks if you work in manufacturing. While you're on maternity leave, all of your employment rights are preserved.
                                                            Paternity Leave and Pay
                                                            Paternity Leave
                                                            Paternity Pay 
                                                            Employees have the right to take paternity leave if their spouse gives birth to a child, as long as they give the proper notice. You must have worked for the same job for at least 26 weeks up until any day during the 15th week before the baby's due date (known as the qualifying week). You have the option of taking one or two weeks. They must be taken all at once, and you must return to work within 56 days after the delivery. While you're on paternity leave, all of your employee rights are preserved.
                                                            Flexible Working
                                                            You have the right to ask for a more flexible schedule. Employees who have worked for the same company for a minimum of 26 weeks have the right to seek flexible working hours (known as making a statutory application). This is a once-a-year application. To make the request, you must write to your employer with the following information:
                                                                The date
                                                                A declaration that this is a statutory request
                                                                Details of how you want to work flexibly
                                                                When you want to start
                                                                An explanation of how flexible working may affect the business and how this may be addressed
                                                            Within three months, your employer must make a decision. If they approve your request, they must amend the terms and circumstances of your contract. If they decline, they must justify their choice based on commercial considerations. If you have a case, you can file a complaint with a tribunal.
                                                            Leave, Notice Period and Redundancy Pay
                                                            Leave Time
                                                            Notice Period
                                                            Redundancy Pay
                                                            Employers must give at least 28 days of paid annual leave per year to employees who work a five-day week. This may include weekends and holidays. You can earn vacation time when on maternity, paternity, or adoption leave, as well as while you're unwell.
                                                            Protection Against Unfair Dismissal
                                                            If an employer chooses to cancel an employment contract, they must provide a legal cause. They must also follow a fair procedure throughout the process and provide the stipulated amount of notice in the contract (unless it is less than the statutory minimum notice time). For one of the following reasons, a reasonable dismissal occurs:
                                                                Your demeanor
                                                                Your competence to do your duties
                                                                Redundancy
                                                                You no longer fulfill a legal condition that allows you to do your job (for example, if you had to drive but lost your license)
                                                            Outside of these four reasons, you can have your contract cancelled for any other significant cause. There are various instances where dismissal might be deemed unjust. To be legally protected against unjust dismissal, you must have been employed by your employer for a minimum of two years.
                                                            Protection Against Unfair Dismissal
                                                            However, there are rare cases of unjust dismissal in which you are protected from the start.
                                                                These are some of them:
                                                                Whistleblowing (if you expose misconduct you've witnessed at work)
                                                                Being fired because of a protected trait, such as race, religion, pregnancy, or sexual orientation
                                                                Refusing to give up a statutory right, such as the right to a break or asking for flexible working hours.
                                                            If an employment tribunal rules that dismissal was unjust, employers must compensate former workers. This can be up to one year's income, with a maximum of £86,444 available (whichever is lower). Keep track of your rights as an employee and you'll be able to see when they're being violated.

                                                            The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the working lives of many people. Whether you are still working, but with new events, on vacation or working from home full time, things are very different than usual. These are tough times, but there are laws, guidelines, and financial support to help you get through this. Here's what you need to know about your COVID-19 employee rights.
                                                            Not everyone can work from home. Understandably, you may be stressed or afraid to go to and from work during the pandemic. Employers must take measures to ensure that their employees are as safe as possible at work.

                                                            Despite the fact that the procedures for each type of workplace vary, there are several steps that occur in all of the government's manuals.
                                                                Surfaces should be cleaned more often.
                                                                Hand sanitizer and frequent hand washing are required.
                                                                Unless you are exempted, you must wear a facial covering.
                                                                Everyone must follow the rules of social separation.
                                                                You may be requested to participate in the NHS Test and Trace program.
                                                                If you come with COVID-19 symptoms, you should be turned away from your workplace.
                                                                Being Placed on Leave
                                                                The government implemented the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in 2020, allowing employees to be placed on temporary leave ('furlough'). It was extended until September 30, 2021. Employees who have been furloughed might be on any form of employment contract, including full-time, part-time, agency, flexible, or zero-hour contracts. Your company applies for a grant to replace 80 per cent of your typical wage for hours not worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, once you've been placed on furlough. They must have written you a letter confirming your vacation or struck an arrangement with a labor union.
                                                                Since they can apply is determined by how long you've been with them.
                                                                    If you were hired between March 20 2020 and October 30 2020, your employer can claim for periods ending on or before April 30 2021 if they submitted PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) to HMRC between those dates.
                                                                    If you started working on March 2nd, 2021, your employer can claim for periods beginning on or after May 1st, 2021, if they reported PAYE RTI to HMRC between March 20th, 2020 and March 2nd, 2021.
                                                                Employers must follow equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation when making choices concerning the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It is your employer's responsibility to pay you the amount to which you are entitled. During your leave, you are not permitted to do any work for them.
                                                                The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme
                                                                Furloughs are not possible for self-employed people. However, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) may be able to help you out. Previous grants have totaled three. This year's Budget included the fourth. This award will be equal to 80% of the average trading gains over the previous three months. 
                                                                It will be paid to you in one lump sum of £7,500. To be eligible for the SEISS grant, you must:
                                                                    Be a self-employed individual or a partner in a partnership
                                                                    Have traded in the tax years 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021
                                                                    Be trading but experiencing reduced demand due to coronavirus, or have temporarily stopped trading due to corona virus
                                                                    Declare that you intend to continue trading
                                                                    Declare that your profits will be significantly reduced due to the coronavirus
                                                                    You will be able to claim from late April 2021 to May 31 2021, if you are eligible. HMRC will contact you with the date you can make your claim from.
                                                                    able to Work
                                                                    Employees may be unable to work under a variety of circumstances. You may have to shield or self-isolate because your workplace is temporarily closed due to coronavirus, you may have care obligations such as homeschooling children, or you may have to shield or self-isolate because of coronavirus. This may have a big influence on your money, which can lead to a lot of anxiety. During this period, however, you may be eligible for a variety of programmes and payments.
                                                                    Your employer might be able to put you on leave. They'll get a grant, which means you'll get paid at 80% of your normal rate. You may be eligible for a furlough if:

                                                                The document review of an Environmental Management System (EMS), compliant to ISO 14001:2015, can start from the Environment policy and the context of the Environment Management System. 
                                                                Based on that, the auditor can verify the risk and opportunities analysis, on internal and external issues, as stated in context and the interested parties’ needs and expectations regarding the environment. The environmental objectives are then verified for whether or not they are derived from the Environmental Policy and critical risk opportunities, highlighted from the organization’s context. Examples of environmental objectives are: reduction in paper consumption by percentage; reduction of CO2 emissions by reduction of power consumption; reduction of air emissions. 

                                                                The auditor can see: legal compliance records; legal evaluation regarding compliance; environment performance reports; management reviews on environmental performance; aspect impact analysis and actions to address significant impacts.

                                                                RESULTS
                                                                DEVIATION
                                                                WHAT IS AUDIT REPORTING AND HOW IS IT DONE?
                                                                Audit reporting is the most important part of an audit. It is the evidence that shows the management system has been assessed with findings and conclusions based on standard audit criteria. Auditors have to identify two types of results during the reporting of an audit:
                                                                1. Exemplary Practice or Conformance - A practice, procedure, or instruction that meets the requirements, or is well above the expected requirements of an operating procedure. This is normally reported as conformance in an audit report. 
                                                                2. Deviation Finding – A deviation finding is due to the reasons presented on the following tab.
                                                                Non-Conformance
                                                                AUDIT FINDINGS
                                                                NON-CONFORMANCE
                                                                NC STATEMENT
                                                                HOW MANY TYPES OF AUDIT FINDINGS ARE REPORTED?
                                                                There are usually three types of audit findings reported: 
                                                                Major NC (Non-Compliance) - is a total absence of a complete requirement in terms of documentation or implementation. A number of minor deviations spreading over a larger area is also termed as Major NC.
                                                                Minor NC - is an isolated incidence or a lapse or slippage on documentation or implementation of a standard requirement.
                                                                Observation - is a potential nonconformity or opinion regarding a condition not covered by a standard.
                                                                Non-Conformance Statements
                                                                POOR NC STATEMENTS
                                                                EXAMPLES OF POOR NON-CONFORMITY STATEMENTS:
                                                                “Quality objectives were not defined”.
                                                                “Test equipment was not calibrated”.
                                                                “Training was not provided.”
                                                                “Identification of material was missing”.
                                                                “Obsolete work instruction was used.”
                                                                “The procedure for testing was wrong”.
                                                                “Job description was not available.”

                                                                A Non-Conformity statement blaming people: “An operator XGHJS did not know how to repair the machine”.
                                                                A Non-Conformity statement blaming the system: “The operator was not properly trained to repair the machine”.
                                                                Audit Results
                                                                AUDIT RESULTS
                                                                MAJOR NC
                                                                Audit Results Communication is an important part of an audit. It involves actions that include:
                                                                • Follow-up on observations and non-conformities.
                                                                • Analysis of corrective actions and their effectiveness.
                                                                • Summary of audit closure status shared for management reviews.

                                                                MINOR NC
                                                                OBSERVATION
                                                                DOCUMENTATION

                                                                WHAT IS MINOR NON-CONFORMANCE?
                                                                Any shortcoming of the audited management system, which is not able to satisfy a written requirement of the standard or procedure and is an isolated event. Thus, it is not reflected as a major nonconformity.
                                                                Minor non-conformities (Minor NC) can be identified by the following criteria: 
                                                                • Minor non-conformity indicates the issue is not significant.
                                                                • The management system is not at stake or subject to high risk.
                                                                Quality Reporting
                                                                REPORTING MECHANISMS
                                                                WHAT IS REPORTING DURING AN AUDIT?
                                                                Reporting in an audit is given by communicating the outcome of the audit.
                                                                Reporting during an audit is done in many ways and is not limited to the preparation of the final written report. It involves the following:
                                                                • Verbal and written reporting at all stages
                                                                • Report outcomes comprehensively
                                                                • Verification and confirmation of both conformances and non-conformances
                                                                • Report should add value to the management system

                                                                • This is referred to as a disturbance in the system.
                                                                • An isolated instance where a standard requirement has not been met.
                                                                Style and Content
                                                                STYLE

                                                                What should the writing style be in an audit report? 
                                                                Audit reports should have the following writing style:
                                                                • Simple language
                                                                • To the point
                                                                • Use of passive/reported speech, avoiding pronouns
                                                                • Do not use abbreviations
                                                                Corrections and Follow-up Activities
                                                                INTRODUCTION
                                                                CORRECTIONS
                                                                WHAT ARE AUDIT FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES?


                                                                Audit follow-up activities include the following: 
                                                                • Observe corrective actions and correction plans.
                                                                • Ensure implementation of actions proposed.
                                                                • After the acceptance of proposed actions, this should be formulated in an action plan.
                                                                • The plan should have a target timeline for every action point.
                                                                • The next audit date is proposed as an audit follow-up activity.
                                                                • The timing of the next audit will be agreed by the seriousness of the non-conformities.
                                                                Corrections and Responsibility
                                                                CORRECTIVE ACTION
                                                                TARGET DATE
                                                                RESPONSIBILITY
                                                                WHAT IS CORRECTIVE ACTION?
                                                                Corrective action is an action that is taken to eradicate the root cause of a non-conformity, so as to avoid reccurrence in the future. 
                                                                For example with a defective product, a re-work was the correction. However action needs to be taken to prevent the defect arising again. Treatment to the production line is a corrective action. This same concept is applied in management systems.
                                                                Measuring Effectiveness
                                                                NC CLOSURE
                                                                What types of follow-ups are done for closure of non-conformities?
                                                                Non-conformity closure is the status of non-conformity, where both correction and corrective action has been taken. In good manufacturing practice, effectiveness of the actions taken is included in the closure. 
                                                                There are two main types of closure of non-conformities, arising from an audit of a management system:
                                                                1) Documented evidence for verification of a non-conformity closure; this is done in the case of minor non-conformities.
                                                                2) A re-verification audit for verification of a non-conformity closure; this is done in the case of major non-conformity.
                                                                In the example of a defective product again, documented closure can be made, with evidence that corrections and corrective action has been taken. However, the effectiveness of the actions taken must be verified in the current production runs of the product.

                                                                CASE INCIDENT 1: In the audit of a brush manufacturer, the auditor noticed 6 brushes of an unknown product in an unmarked box under the production line. The brushes were unmarked and the operator told the auditor that they were left from the previous shift and that he thought they may be "reject brushes".
                                                                TASK 2: If there is a non-conformity, select the appropriate clause that is violated, by completing the question on the following set of slides. If non-conformity does not exist, select: non-conformity is not applicable.

                                                                A management system program, is a program developed by a management system, to achieve objective targets, with defined action plans and target dates.
                                                                All employees should have awareness of the policies and consequences of their own tasks, as defined by the objectives of the management system.
                                                                An auditor verifies whether or not an organization has established procedures, to ensure that documents are controlled in proper ways, to address the following issues:

                                                                • Are not obsolete or have been removed
                                                                • Are legible and dated
                                                                • Include dates of revisions where applicable
                                                                • Have a retention period
                                                                On successful completion of this module, you will be able to: 

                                                                    Define what alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is
                                                                    Identify the benefits of using ADR
                                                                    Describe the national principles of resolving dispute resolution
                                                                    Describe the role of an ADR practitioner
                                                                    Explain various aspects of preparing for ADR
                                                                    Scenario
                                                                    Imagine that you’ve been wronged by a supplier, by your employer, or by a business where you are a customer. You’ve correctly determined that you have an actionable legal claim. What are you going to do?
                                                                    You probably won’t run to the courthouse to file a formal complaint to initiate litigation. This is because litigation is very expensive and time consuming. Besides, you may wish to continue doing business with the supplier, employer, or business.
                                                                    Perhaps the matter is of a private nature, and you do not want to engage in a public process to determine the outcome. You would like the dispute to be resolved, but you do not want to engage in public, time consuming, expensive litigation to do it.
                                                                    A common method of dispute resolution that avoids many of the challenges associated with litigation is alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

                                                                    Identify the level of confidentiality in ADR

                                                                What is ADR?
                                                                ADR involves resolving disputes outside of the judicial process, though the judiciary can require parties to participate in specific types of ADR, such as arbitration, for some types of conflicts.
                                                                Moreover, some ADR methods vest power to resolve the dispute in a neutral party, while other strategies vest that power in the parties themselves. 
                                                                Common methods of ADR include negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. 
                                                                Lesser used methods of ADR include mini-trials, hybrid forms of mediation-arbitration (with elements of both), and collaborative goal-oriented processes. 
                                                                When is ADR used?
                                                                ADR is often used to resolve disputes among businesses, employers and employees, and businesses and consumers. ADR can also be used in many other types of conflicts. For instance, ADR strategies can be used in domestic law cases, such as divorce, or in international legal issues, such as issues relating 
                                                                to trans-boundary pollution. ADR methods are used outside of the courtroom, but that does not mean that they are outside of the interests of our legal system. 
                                                                Participation in ADR has important legal consequences. For instance, parties that have agreed by contract to be subject to binding arbitration give up their constitutional right to bring their complaint to court.The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is a federal statute under which parties are required to participate in arbitration when they have agreed by contract to do so, even in state court matters. Indeed, the FAA is a national policy favoring arbitration. 
                                                                ADR and You
                                                                There is a very good chance that you will—or already have—signed a contract that contains a mandatory arbitration clause. This means that if a dispute arises under that contract, then you will be required to arbitrate your claim rather than going straight to court. Under a binding arbitration clause, you will have waived your constitutional rights to go to court.
                                                                Even if you have never signed such a contract and never will, there is still a good likelihood that you will be involved in a commercial dispute at some point in your life. Because of this, it’s important to understand the ADR process, situations in which litigation is a better choice than ADR, and special issues that arise when parties have unequal bargaining power.
                                                                ADR Practitioners
                                                                Each ADR process is different. The amount of time an ADR process takes changes depending on the type of process and the details of your dispute. ADR practitioners are trained to help you and the other people involved to work toward a solution. The role of an ADR practitioner is different depending on the type of ADR process. 

                                                                In some ADR processes, the practitioner can give advice or make decisions for you.You should choose the ADR process that sounds as if it will work for you. 
                                                                Using ADR can: 

                                                                    help you to resolve all or some of the issues in your dispute.
                                                                    provide a fair process.
                                                                    help you to achieve outcomes that work for everyone involved in the dispute.


                                                                Why choose ADR?
                                                                Resolving your dispute through ADR is different from asking a court or tribunal to resolve your dispute. Using ADR to resolve your dispute can benefit everyone. It means that courts and tribunals can spend their time considering disputes that need a court or tribunal decision. 
                                                                Flexibility
                                                                 ADR processes can be flexible, because the process can be made to suit your particular dispute. 
                                                                   -Court processes are generally less flexible. 
                                                                Privacy and Confidentiality

                                                                Self-directed

                                                                hat are the National Principles for Resolving Disputes?
                                                                NADRAC’s National Principles for Resolving Disputes are about using ADR when you have a dispute instead of going to court—and still using ADR even if you do go to court. They also offer information about how ADR aims to work so that you know what to expect if you choose to use ADR. 
                                                                There are 7 national principles:
                                                                National Principle 1
                                                                Self-responsibility is the first step.

                                                                To resolve your dispute, you need to take responsibility for: 
                                                                • being clear about what is in dispute 
                                                                • genuinely trying to resolve the dispute 
                                                                • seeking support when you need it
                                                                National Principle 2
                                                                Support in Dispute Resolution
                                                                Support People Generally
                                                                Some people prefer to have a support person with them in dispute resolution processes, particularly ADR processes; some do not. 
                                                                A support person can add value for all the people involved in resolving the dispute. If you ask someone to be your support person, it is best if they are not directly involved in the dispute. 

                                                                If you want to have a support person with you during your ADR process you will need to talk to your ADR practitioner to make sure this is okay. 
                                                                A support person is someone who can: 
                                                                • give you emotional and practical support 
                                                                • help you understand the issues in dispute and what is important to you 
                                                                • gently challenge you if you get stuck on one idea 
                                                                • take notes or remind you later of things said. 

                                                                Your support person could be: 
                                                                • a family member 
                                                                • a friend 
                                                                • a work colleague 
                                                                • a social worker 
                                                                • a union representative 
                                                                • a counseling psychologist 
                                                                • a professional adviser (for example, your lawyer,
                                                                Support in Dispute Resolution
                                                                Lawyers
                                                                A lawyer may be able to help you resolve your dispute, whether you choose to use an ADR process, an ombudsman, or go to a court or tribunal. It is up to you to decide what you want a lawyer to do for you. If your lawyer cannot help you with something, they will tell you so.
                                                                Lawyers in ADR process:
                                                                Some ADR processes involve lawyers; some do not. Lawyers can give you advice before and after each ADR session, as they may not be present or may take a ‘backseat’ role during the session. They can also give you advice after the ADR session about what can happen next and how the proposed agreement will work for you. You decide what to do after listening to your lawyer.
                                                                Lawyers in court or tribunals:
                                                                A lawyer’s role in a court or tribunal process is more formal than their role in an ADR process. You can choose whether you just want advice from your lawyer, or whether you want them to present your case to the court or tribunal as well. You may choose to present your own case to the court or tribunal. Some courts and many tribunals have user-friendly processes to help you. You decide what to do after listening to your lawyer.
                                                                Your Role in ADR
                                                                ADR processes are different and your role can be different too. Sometimes you and the other participants may discuss and/or sign a contract before the first ADR session begins. This contract can outline everyone’s roles. 
                                                                For example:

                                                                    In processes like mediation, you usually have a very active role—your role includes listening, talking, and deciding. 
                                                                    In processes like conciliation, the ADR practitioner may give you advice—your role includes listening, talking ,and deciding. Your decisions include whether you will accept the ADR practitioner’s advice. 
                                                                    In processes like arbitration, you can have a less active role. You and the other participants present the information and your points of view to the ADR practitioner, who makes the decision based on the information provided.
                                                                    Suggestions for Getting the Most Out of your ADR session

                                                                        Define the purpose of a safety policy and explain its significance within an organisation.
                                                                        Identify legal and regulatory requirements essential for drafting a compliant safety policy.
                                                                        Assess the impact of a well-crafted safety policy on organisational culture and employee safety.

                                                                        Discuss the importance of communication and training in implementing safety policies.
                                                                        Recognise internal and external stakeholders and their influence on safety policy development.

                                                                    Definition and Purpose
                                                                    A safety policy is a formal, written statement outlining an organisation’s commitment to maintaining a safe working environment. It sets out clear guidelines for how health and safety are managed within the organisation, as well as the roles and responsibilities of management, employees, and other stakeholders.
                                                                    A well-defined safety policy demonstrates the organisation’s dedication to protecting its workforce, contractors, visitors, and the public from potential hazards.

                                                                    Click the button to open the modal
                                                                    Legal and Regulatory Requirements
                                                                    Adhering to legal and regulatory frameworks is crucial for ensuring the safety policy is compliant with national and international laws. These requirements differ across industries and locations, but they typically include standards that employers must meet to safeguard the health and safety of employee
                                                                    Impact on Organisational Culture and Employee Safety
                                                                    A well-crafted safety policy not only ensures legal compliance but also facilitates a culture of safety within the organisation. Leadership plays a key role in shaping this culture by actively promoting safety initiatives and holding employees accountable for their safety practices. A strong safety culture leads to proactive behaviours, where employees actively identify and mitigate hazards, creating a safer work environment for all.
                                                                    Health and Safety Objectives
                                                                    Objectives set the foundation for what the safety policy aims to achieve. These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). For example, an objective might be to "reduce workplace incidents by 20% within the next 12 months." By having clear objectives, the organisation can track progress and make adjustments to improve safety outcomes.
                                                                    Health and safety objectives should align with the broader goals of the organisation. For instance, a company focused on reducing operational costs might set an objective to decrease accidents, which in turn reduces costs associated with injury-related downtime.

                                                                    Roles and Responsibilities
                                                                    A clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is essential to the success of any safety policy. 

                                                                        Hierarchy of Responsibilities: Senior management is typically responsible for setting the safety policy and allocating resources, while supervisors ensure compliance on a day-to-day basis. Employees are responsible for following safety guidelines and reporting hazards.
                                                                        Clear Accountability: Each role should have clearly defined responsibilities to ensure accountability. For example, the safety officer might be responsible for conducting regular safety audits, while employees might be responsible for attending mandatory safety training.

                                                                    Example: In a hospital, the safety officer might be responsible for conducting regular safety audits, while nursing staff are tasked with maintaining hygiene standards to prevent the spread of infections.
                                                                    Communication and Training
                                                                    Effective communication and ongoing training are critical components of an effective safety policy.

                                                                    Clear communication ensures that all employees are aware of safety protocols, while regular training reinforces these practices and keeps safety at the forefront of daily operations. 
                                                                    Effective Communication
                                                                    Training Programs
                                                                    Methods: Communication methods may include safety briefings, email updates, bulletin boards, and digital platforms. The key is to ensure that all employees, regardless of their role or location, receive and understand the safety policy.


                                                                    Feedback Loops: Employees should be encouraged to provide feedback on the safety policy and report any issues. This can be done through suggestion boxes, safety committees, or regular meetings.
                                                                    Internal and External Stakeholders
                                                                    An effective safety policy requires the active involvement of both internal and external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders, including employees and management, play a direct role in implementing and upholding safety standards.
                                                                    Internal Stakeholders
                                                                    External Stakeholders
                                                                    Who They Are: Employees, management, safety officers, and internal safety committees are considered internal stakeholders. Their buy-in is essential for the effective implementation of the safety policy.

                                                                    Their Role: Internal stakeholders are directly involved in the day-to-day application of the safety policy. They are responsible for following the guidelines and contributing to a safe working environment
                                                                    Involvement of Management and Employees
                                                                    In the process of writing a safety policy, the involvement of both management and employees is essential to ensure its effectiveness.
                                                                    Management Commitment
                                                                    Leadership Buy-In: The success of any safety policy begins with the commitment of top management. Without their visible support and active participation, the policy may fail to gain the necessary traction across the organisation. Leaders must not only endorse the policy but also model the behaviour it advocates. Their buy-in signals to all employees that safety is a priority. It also fosters a culture of accountability, where safety is everyone’s responsibility.
                                                                    Resource Allocation: Management's role doesn't stop at endorsing the policy; they must also provide the necessary resources to make it work. This includes budgeting for safety training, purchasing appropriate safety equipment, and ensuring that there is adequate staffing to manage safety initiatives. For example, allocating funds for new personal protective equipment (PPE) or investing in comprehensive safety training programmes ensures that employees have the tools and knowledge to work safely. Without these resources, even the best-written policy could fail in practic
                                                                    Involvement of Management and Employees Continued
                                                                    This approach not only solidifies the importance of collaborative efforts in writing a safety policy but also equips participants with the skills and perspectives needed to engage effectively with all stakeholders in the organisations.
                                                                    Employee Engagement:

                                                                        Empowerment: Employees are the frontline of safety and should be empowered to contribute actively to the safety culture. This can be done by involving them in safety committees, where they can voice their concerns and suggest improvements. Encouraging employees to report hazards without fear of retaliation is also crucial. When employees are empowered, they are more likely to take ownership of safety, leading to a more proactive approach to hazard identification and risk management.
                                                                        Incentives: To further motivate employees, some organisations implement safety incentive programmes. These programmes reward employees for identifying safety improvements or maintaining a certain number of accident-free days. Incentives can range from recognition in meetings to financial rewards or extra time off. Such programmes not only enhance safety but a

                                                                        Engaging stakeholders ensures that the policy is not only comprehensive but also practical and aligned with the needs of the organisation.
                                                                        Consultation

This can be achieved through various methods such as surveys, focus groups, or formal meetings. The primary goal of consultation is to ensure that the safety policy reflects the perspectives, concerns, and requirements of all stakeholders involved. By gathering input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including employees, management, and external experts, the policy is more likely to be effective and widely accepted.

                                                                            Roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined within the policy. Management is accountable for setting the policy and allocating resources, while employees must follow safety guidelines and report hazards.
                                                                            Effective communication and training are key to ensuring all employees understand the safety policy. Regular training and feedback loops help reinforce safety procedures and encourage continuous improvement.
                                                                            Stakeholders, both internal (employees, safety officers) and external (regulatory bodies, contractors), play an essential role in the effective implementation of a safety policy.
                                                                            The involvement of both management and employees in creating and maintaining the policy ensures its success. Management commitment and employee engagement foster a proactive safety culture.
                                                                            Consultation and collaboration between departments and stakeholders during policy development ensure the policy is comprehensive, relevant, and widely accepted across the organisation.
                                                                            Lesson Summary
                                                                                A safety policy is a formal written statement that outlines an organisation’s commitment to maintaining a safe working environment. It establishes guidelines for managing health and safety and defines the roles of management, employees, and stakeholders.
                                                                                The safety policy plays a central role in risk management, ensuring organisational consistency in safety practices and promoting continuous improvement as new risks and safety measures are identified.
                                                                                Legal and regulatory compliance is essential. Organisations must adhere to relevant laws like the UK Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and international standards such as ISO 45001 to avoid legal penalties and ensure a safer working environment.
                                                                                A strong safety culture is cultivated when leaders promote and model adherence to the safety policy. This leadership fosters a workplace where employees take proactive steps to ensure their own and others' safety.
                                                                                The policy should include clear health and safety objectives, aligned with broader business goals, and use the SMART framework to make objectives specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-boun

                                                                                A safety audit is a systematic examination of an organisation's safety policies, practices, and procedures. It aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the current safety framework. A comprehensive audit involves planning, data collection, analysis, and reporting to ensure that safety protocols are effective and compliant with applicable laws.
                                                                                Process of Conducting a Safety Audit
                                                                                    Planning the Audit: The audit should begin with a clear plan outlining the scope, objectives, and criteria for evaluation. It should also define the roles and responsibilities of the audit team.
                                                                                    Data Collection: The audit involves gathering data through observations, interviews, inspections, and document reviews. This data helps assess whether the organisation is complying with its safety policy and relevant regulations.
                                                                                    Analysis and Reporting: After data collection, the audit team analyses the findings to identify gaps or areas of non-compliance. A report is then prepared, outlining the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for improvement.
                                                                                    Identifying Specific Risks and Hazards
                                                                                    After completing the safety audit, the subsequent step is to pinpoint specific risks and hazards within the organisation. This requires evaluating both physical hazards as well as non-physical hazards.
                                                                                    Hazard Identification Process

                                                                                    Risk Prioritisation
                                                                                    Aligning With Organisational Goals
                                                                                    Safety policies should align with the broader objectives of the organisation. By integrating safety goals into the overall business strategy, organisations can ensure that safety is not viewed as a standalone concern but as an essential element of operational excellence.
                                                                                    Integration With Business Objectives
                                                                                        Strategic Alignment: The safety policy should be aligned with the overall goals and mission of the organisation. For example, if a company’s goal is to achieve operational excellence, the safety policy should emphasise efficient and safe work practices.
                                                                                        Sustainability and Safety: Organisations focused on sustainability can align their safety policies with environmental goals, such as reducing workplace incidents that lead to environmental damage.
                                                                                    Risk Assessment follows right after conducting a safety audit, this step is to identify specific risks and hazards within the organisation. This involves assessing both physical hazards (e.g., machinery, chemicals) and non-physical hazards (e.g., ergonomic issues, stress).

                                                                    Writing Clear and Concise Statements
                                                                    A well-written safety policy should be clear, concise, and easily understood by all employees. Avoid jargon and complex language to ensure that everyone, regardless of their role or education, can comprehend the policy's intent and requirements.
                                                                    Clarity and Precision

                                                                        Simplicity: The safety policy should be written in clear and concise language that is easily understood by all employees, regardless of their level of education or experience. Avoid jargon and complex sentences.
                                                                        Directness: Statements should be direct and to the point, outlining specific actions, responsibilities, and expectations. For example, instead of saying “Employees are encouraged to report hazards,” the policy should state “Employees must report any hazards immediately to their supervisor.

                                                                    Including Essential Elements (Scope, Objectives, Roles)
                                                                    A comprehensive safety policy should include essential elements such as:
                                                                    Scope
                                                                    Objectives
                                                                    Roles
                                                                    The scope of the safety policy should clearly outline the areas of the organisation it applies to, including specific departments, activities, and employee groups. This ensures that everyone knows the extent of the policy’s application.
                                                                    Tailoring the Policy to Different Departments
                                                                    Each department in an organisation encounters unique safety challenges based on the nature of its work. To ensure the safety policy is effective, it must be customised to meet the specific needs of each department while maintaining a unified approach throughout the organisation. This tailored approach ensures that all employees are protected according to the particular risks they face, without compromising the overall consistency and coherence of the policy.

                                                                            Layouts Are Important
                                                                            Layouts play a crucial role in technical writing as they help to organize information in a clear and concise manner. A well-designed layout can make a technical document more accessible and easier to understand for the reader. Technical writing is all about communicating complex information in a simple and straightforward way, and a good layout can help achieve this goal.
                                                                            One of the key benefits of a good layout is that it can help to break up large blocks of text into smaller, more manageable sections. This can make it easier for the reader to scan the document and find the information they need quickly.
                                                                            Headings and subheadings can be used to create a clear hierarchy of information, with the most important information presented first. Bullet points and numbered lists can also be used to highlight key points and make the information more digestible.
                                                                            Another important aspect of layout design is the use of white space. White space refers to the empty space around text and images on a page. By using white space effectively, a technical writer can create a more visually appealing document that is easier to read. White space can be used to separate different sections of the document, draw attention to important information, and create a sense of balance and harmony on the page.
                                                                            riting process.

                                                                        In technical writing, it's important to understand the requirements of a sentence to ensure that it is clear, concise, and effective in conveying information. Here are some guidelines for understanding sentence requirements in technical writing:

                                                                            Identify the subject and verb: Identify the subject and verb of the sentence to ensure that the sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is the person or thing that performs the action, and the verb is the action being performed.

                                                                            Use proper sentence structure: Use proper sentence structure to ensure that the sentence is clear and easy to understand. A sentence should have a subject, verb, and object and should be written in a logical order.
                                                                            Use appropriate punctuation: Use appropriate punctuation to clarify the meaning of the sentence. For example, use commas to separate items in a list or to set off nonessential information.
                                                                            Avoid sentence fragments: Avoid sentence fragments, which are incomplete sentences that do not contain a subject or verb. Sentence fragments can be confusing and difficult to understand.

                                                                            Use parallel structure: Use parallel structure to make the sentence easier to read and understand. Parallel structure means using the same grammatical structure for similar ideas in a sentence.

                                                                            Use appropriate sentence length: Use appropriate sentence length to ensure that the sentence is easy to read and understand. Long, complex sentences can be difficult to follow.
                                                                            Technical Writing Style
                                                                            The goal of technical writing is to enable readers to use technology or understand a process or concept. Because the subject matter is more important than the writer’s voice, technical writing style uses an objective, not a subjective, tone.
                                                                            Here are some key characteristics of technical writing style:
                                                                                Clarity: Technical writing style uses clear and concise language that is easy for readers to understand. Technical writers avoid using complex vocabulary and technical jargon that may be difficult for non-experts to understand.
                                                                                Directness: Technical writing should be direct and to the point. Technical writers use short sentences and avoid using unnecessary words or phrases.
                                                                                Objectivity: Technical writing style uses an objective tone, focusing on the facts rather than the writer's opinions or feelings. Technical writers avoid using emotional language or persuasive techniques.
                                                                                Accuracy: Technical writers ensure that their writing is factually correct, precise and free from errors.
                                                                                Visuals: Technical writing often uses visuals such as diagrams, charts, and graphs to help readers understand complex information. These visuals should be clear and easy to read and should be placed where they would most benefit readers.
                                                                                Clarity in Technical Writing
                                                                                Clarity is essential to effective communication in technical writing. Without clarity, readers may misunderstand the information presented in the document, which can lead to errors and confusion. Achieving clarity in technical writing requires a focus on two key elements: sentence structure and language.
                                                                                1. Sentence Structure
                                                                                2. Language
                                                                                Technical writers should use short, simple sentences that are easy for readers to understand. Long, complex sentences can be difficult to follow and may lead to confusion. Technical writers should also use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to read.
                                                                                Technical writers should use concrete language and avoid using vague or general terms. They should also define any technical terms or acronyms used in the document to ensure that readers understand their meaning.

                                                                        Conciseness
                                                                        Conciseness is a key element of effective technical writing. It means that extraneous words, phrases, clauses, and sentences have been removed from writing without sacrificing clarity or appropriate detail.
                                                                        Conciseness is important in technical writing because it helps to ensure that the information presented is clear and easy to understand. By eliminating unnecessary words and phrases, technical writers can focus on the main message and avoid confusing readers with extraneous information.
                                                                        Concise writing is also more efficient, as it allows readers to quickly find the information they need without having to wade through unnecessary text. 

                                                                        Overall, conciseness is an essential element of effective technical writing that helps to ensure that the information presented is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
                                                                        Tips for Writing Concisely
                                                                        To write concisely in technical writing, it is important to focus on the main message and avoid unnecessary information.
                                                                        The following tips will help you write concisely:

                                                                            Use short, simple sentences that are easy to understand.

                                                                            Avoid using technical jargon and complex vocabulary that may be difficult for non-experts to understand.

                                                                            Use active voice instead of passive voice to make your writing more direct and concise.

                                                                            Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases, such as adjectives and adverbs, that do not add meaning to your writing.

                                                                            Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to read.
                                                                            Objective Writing
                                                                            Objective writing means presenting information without actively convincing the reader of something or eliciting a particular response. To write objectively in technical writing, it is important to focus on the facts rather than the writer's opinions or feelings.
                                                                            In technical writing, objectivity is important to ensure that the information presented is accurate, informative, and free of bias. By presenting verifiable facts and avoiding emotional language or persuasive techniques, technical writers can create documents that are objective and informative.

Overall, objective writing is an essential element of effective technical writing that helps to ensure that the information presented is accurate, informative, and free from bias.

                                                                        Biased Language
                                                                        Biased language can be a barrier to effective communication in technical writing. It can reveal the writer's point of view, making it weighted and subjective. To avoid biased language in technical writing, it is important to use language that is neutral and free from stereotypes or assumptions. Here are some tips to help you avoid biased language:

                                                                            Use gender-neutral language, such as "they" instead of "he" or "she."

                                                                            Avoid using language that assumes a particular race, ethnicity, or nationality.

                                                                            Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals and groups.

                                                                                Containers maintain standards around portability, separation of concerns, and standardised packaging.
                                                                                Kubernetes: It can be described as a container orchestration tool that can be run on Linux and Windows servers. It is a free and open-source project that supports native cloud applications. Kubernetes has many components, and those components all interact with each other through the API server.
                                                                                Docker: It is a containerization platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all the required components, such as libraries and other dependencies and deploy it as one package.

                                                                                        The Gini impurity measures the frequency at which any element of the dataset will be mislabelled when randomly labelled. The Gini impurity is calculated using a specific formula.
                                                                                            The Gini index has values inside the interval [0, 0.5], whereas the interval of Entropy is [0, 1]
                                                                                            Entropy is more complex since it makes use of logs. So, the calculation of the Gini Index will be faster. 
                                                                                        We have already performed pre-pruning by specifying the maximum depth in our implementation, or by controlling the different hyper-parameters in Sklearn implementation, such as the min-samples-split and max-leaf-nodes.
                                                                                        However, this approach is not preferred or should not be used alone because a perfect split might follow a seemingly worthless split early in the tree. Therefore, you should combined it with post-pruning, also known as cost-complexity pruning or weakest link pruning.
                                                                                        Information gain is biased for the attribute with many outcomes. It means it prefers the attribute with a large number of distinct values.

                                                                                            Ensemble learning is about combining many mediocre (weak) models in one supermodel.

                                                                                            Bootstrap addresses a very famous challenge in statistics. We only have a population sample, but we want to collect information about the whole population. How to make sure that this sample represents the entire population? Is the mean of the sample a good approximation for the mean of the population?
                                                                                            The basic idea of bagging is to create different models using different bootstrapped training sets and average their predictions to produce the final output of the model. Bagging improves prediction accuracy at the expense of interpretability.
                                                                                            A Random forest is a slightly modified bagging algorithm. It is basically a collection of decorrelated decision trees, built as follows. For every tree:
                                                                                                We subsample the examples with replacement bootstrapping.
                                                                                                For each subsample, we choose attributes at random.
                                                                                                We randomly pick features in each split.
                                                                                                We build the tree only on these random features and with the current subsample.
                                                                                                Learning Outcomes

                                                                                                    Define a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
                                                                                                    Contrast SVM Hard Margin to an SVM Soft Margin.

                                                                                                    Describe SVM cross-validation.
                                                                                                    Distinguish between machine learning and data standardization.
                                                                                                    List the strengths and weaknesses of the K-Means algorithm
                                                                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                                                                    By default, Support Vector Machines (SVM) gives more weight to correct classification than margin maximization. SVM can detect outliers and ignore them.
                                                                                                    The Kernel function defines inner products in the transformed space. The kernel function defines similarity in the transformed space.
                                                                                                    Evaluating K only requires ONE ADDITION and ONE EXPONENTATION more than the original dot product does.
                                                                                                    Gamma is a hyper-parameter that controls the distance of influence of a single training point.
                                                                                                    Low values of gamma indicate a large similarity radius which results in more points being grouped. For high gamma values, the points need to be very close to each other to be considered in the same group (or class). Therefore, models with substantial gamma values tend to overfit.
                                                                                                    Learning Outcomes

                                                                                                        Outline the Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
                                                                                                        List the various drawbacks of the PCA.
                                                                                                        Recall the main applications of the PCA.
                                                                                                        Discuss the image compression.
                                                                                                        Explain data visualization.
                                                                                                        Contrast supervised learning to unsupervised learning.
                                                                                                        Lesson Summary
                                                                                                        PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. The goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while keeping the information loss to a minimum.
                                                                                                        PCA assumes that the variables are linearly correlated. If the correlation is not linear, then PCA will not be efficient. PCA performs “lossy” compression, which means that information is lost when we discard insignificant components.
                                                                                                        The scaling of variables can yield different results. Hence, the scaling that you use should be documented. You should not adjust scaling to match prior knowledge of data.
                                                                                                        Since each principal components is a linear combination of the original features, visualizations are not easy to interpret or relate to original features.
                                                                                                        Learning Outcomes

                                                                                                            Identify how to compute W for hidden nodes and describe how backpropagation works
                                                                                                            State the  examples of backpropagation calculations
                                                                                                            Outline how to update the weight in the backpropagation algorithm
                                                                                                            Describe the K-means clustering and list the application of machine learning
                                                                                                            Lesson Summary
                                                                                                            Machine Learning is a part of artificial intelligence mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on its own.
                                                                                                                Non-symbolic machine learning approaches rely on weights optimization or gradient descent search instead of symbolic generalisation and specialization in learning. For example, a neural network uses gradient descent search.
                                                                                                                An artificial neuron consists of input, output and hidden layers, while an actual one has a cell nucleus, axon and dendrites.
                                                                                                                The structures and operations of human neurons serve as the basis for artificial neural networks.
                                                                                                                The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron model was established in 1943 as the first computational model neuron to calculate the logic function AND and OR.
                                                                                                                Frank Rosenblatt devised a learning algorithm called perceptron as a single-layer neural network. The main parameters include input values, weights and Bias, net sum, and an activation function.

                            The findings from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study led to the development of the measure, The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree or ICT.
                            Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. 
                            Psychopathy, characterized by a constellation of traits like lack of empathy and chronic manipulative behavior, does not inherently lead to violent acts like homicide, whereas homicide typology aids in categorizing different motives and patterns of lethal acts. 
                            Intimate partner violence (IPV) consists of mental, physical, and/or sexual abuse committed by an intimate partner. At the heart of IPV is the belief that one is entitled to control one’s partner and an obsessive need to exercise that control.
                            The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders. 
                            The FBI defines serial murder as “the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events.
                             The serial murderer often blends in with the community and may appear to others as a “normal” individual, although psychopathy and serial killing are closely linked.

Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:

    Define the fundamental properties of sound, including frequency, amplitude, and wavelength.
    Describe how sound travels through different mediums and its interaction with the environment.
    Explain the stages of signal flow from sound source to output device.
    Classify different types of audio signals, such as mic-level, line-level, and speaker-level.
    Define the purpose and operation of electroacoustic devices such as microphones and speakers.
    Categorize different types of microphones based on their construction and use cases.
    Plan the setup of a recording session, considering equipment and acoustic treatments.
    Identify various microphone techniques and compare their effects on sound capture.
    Outline the primary goals of mixing and mastering in audio production.
    Apply level balancing, panning, and EQ techniques to create cohesive mixes.
    Lesson Summary
        Recording involves capturing sound waves and converting them into digital or analog formats for playback. This process requires careful planning, from selecting the right equipment to optimizing the recording environment.
        The recording environment plays a significant role in the quality of the captured sound. Acoustic treatments like foam panels, bass traps, and diffusers minimize unwanted reflections and ensure clarity.
        After initial recording, the focus shifts to editing, where engineers refine audio to achieve a polished result. Editing involves tasks like cutting, comping, noise reduction, and aligning performances to a timing grid.
        One critical step is comping, which involves selecting the best sections from multiple takes and combining them into a seamless performance. This technique is especially useful for vocals and intricate instrumental recordings.
        Mixing is the process of balancing and blending individual audio tracks to create a cohesive piece of music or sound. Engineers adjust levels, panning, equalization, and effects to shape the sonic landscape.Level balancing ensures that each element in a mix is appropriately audible. Engineers carefully control the volume of instruments and vocals to maintain clarity while emphasizing key elements.
        Lesson Summary
            Sound is the vibration of air molecules that creates pressure waves perceptible to the human ear. It has essential properties like frequency, which determines pitch, and amplitude, which governs loudness. Understanding these principles is fundamental to sound engineering, a field focused on capturing, manipulating, and reproducing sound effectively.
            Sound engineering involves both scientific and creative processes. Engineers use their technical expertise to design and operate recording equipment while employing artistic judgment to shape the sound’s aesthetic. This dual role requires a strong understanding of acoustics, physics, and the psychological impact of sound.
            Signal flow refers to the path audio signals take from their source to the output. It begins at the sound source, such as a voice or instrument, and moves through various stages, including microphones, preamplifiers, and processors, before reaching speakers or headphones.
            The first stage in signal flow involves capturing the audio signal. Microphones convert sound waves into electrical signals, with different types suited for specific applications. For example, dynamic microphones are durable and ideal for live settings, while condenser microphones capture subtle details in studio environments.
            Electroacoustic devices are tools that convert sound energy into electrical energy or vice versa. They are essential in sound engineering for capturing, manipulating, and reproducing audio. Examples include microphones, speakers, and headphones.
            Microphones are the primary electroacoustic devices used for capturing sound. Dynamic microphones operate using electromagnetic induction, making them durable and suitable for high-pressure sound environments. Condenser microphones, on the other hand, use capacitors and require phantom power, offering high sensitivity and detail.

        Introduction
        The word 'Engineering" originated from the Latin root ingeniere, which means to design or to devise. The Latin root "in generate" means "to create". Engineers are individuals who design industrial products by combining the knowledge of science, mathematics, and economics and develop the technology for outputting a product to solve problems that are beneficial to society. 
        Mechanical engineers are involved in the research, development, design, manufacturing, and testing the tools, engines, machines, and other mechanical devices. 
        In this topic, you will learn briefly about what mechanical engineering is all about.
        What is Engineering?
        To put it in a simple way, engineers are involved in developing new and better technologies using their knowledge of mathematics, science, and materials. 
        However, they are not solely restricted to the development of new technology but also to communication and skills.
        What is Engineering?
        Many students start studying mechanical engineering due to their interest in mathematics and science. Others because they are interested in technology. 
        However, whatever an individual interest may be, by the end of the day, the objective of an engineer is to build a device that can do a task accurately, quickly, and safely. Before any metal is cut or hardware is manufactured, an engineer can refine ideas on paper and with computer simulations, saving time and money by testing fewer mock-ups.
        What is Mechanics?
        The branch of natural science that deals with the state of motion and the state of the rest of the masses under the action of force is mechanics. Mechanics has been at the centre of interest of many philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists for many centuries. 
        The mechanics developed by the scientists can be classified into the following classes:
            Classical Mechanics/Newtonian Mechanics.
            Relativistic Mechanics.
            Quantum Mechanics.
        What is Mechanics?
        Sir Isaac Newton combined the philosophy and experimental observations involving the state of matter in the states of rest and motion and deducted the three laws of motion and the law of gravitation. Classical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics is based on these laws.
        Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
        When the length scale goes down to the atomic length scale, certain phenomena can not be explained with
        Newtonian mechanics. The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviors of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Qu
        Laws of Mechanics
        In this section, we will discuss the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics. First, we will discuss Newton's three laws of motion, and then we will discuss the gravitational law of Newton.
        Newton's First Law of Motion
        Newton's Second Law of Motion
        Newton's Third Law of Motion
        Newton's Law of Gravitation
        calars and Vectors
        In engineering mechanics, scalars or vectors are used to measure all physical quantities.
            Scalar: Any physical quantity, either positive or negative, that can be completely described by its magnitude is a scalar. Scalar quantities include things like length, mass, and time.
            Vector: Any physical quantity that needs both a magnitude and a direction to be fully described is referred to as a vector. Velocity, force, and moment are a few statics-related examples of vectors. Typically, an arrow is used for the visual representation of a vector.
            The magnitude of the vector: the length of the arrow.
            The vector's line of action: the angle between the line and a fixed axis.
            The vector's sense of direction: the arrow's head or tip corresponds to.
            The vector quantities are represented by:
            In print: by bold letters, e.g., A.
            In handwriting: by drawing an arrow on top of it.
        Statement: Every object continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled by an external agency acting on it
        Newton's first law of motion has defined force as an external agency that influences the state of motion or the rest of an object.
        A body in rest or in motion will remain in its position with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.
        Vector Operations
        In this section, we will discuss different vector operations that are essential for engineering problems.
        Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
        A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
        Vector Addition Operations
        The vector addition of different vector quantities obeys the parallelogram law of addition. The vector addition operation of two vectors A and B is illustrated in Fig. 2 and done by the following procedure:
        1. Connect the component vectors A and 8 1 s tails together at a point to make them concurrent.
        2. Draw a line parallel to A from the head of B. Similarly, draw another line parallel to B from the head of A. The neighbouring sides of a parallelogram are formed by the intersection of these two lines at point P (Figure: 2).
        3. The diagonal R of this parallelogram that extends to P is the resultant of the vector R = A + B.
        Equilibrium of a Particle
        Condition for the Equilibrium of a particle
        If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
        The word "equilibrium," or more specifically "static equilibrium," is most frequently used to refer to an item that is at rest. The resulting force acting on a particle must be equal to zero in order to satisfy Newton's first equation of motion and preserve Equilibrium. This circumstance can be represented numerically as:-
        The above equation represents the vector sum of all the forces acting on the particle. This equation is the sufficient condition for Equilibrium. 
        Basic Terminology in Thermodynamics
        Before we move into the world of thermodynamics, we should first discuss the macroscopic and microscopic points of view along with some basic terminology.
        Boundary
        A boundary is a closed surface that separates a constrained space or a finite amount of substance from its surroundings

        The Microscopic Point of View
        ntroduction
        Fluid mechanics is the study of all fluids in static and dynamic conditions. Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium. This topic will introduce you to the physical concepts that underpin fluid mechanics.
        Fluid Mechanics
        The main difference between a fluid and a solid is that a solid deforms only a finite amount due to applied shear stress until the elastic limit. 
        On the other hand, the fluid continuously deforms as long as the shear stress is applied.
        Both gases and liquids fall under the term "fluid". We will use the term "fluid" to apply to either a gas or liquid.
        Lesson Summary
            Mechanical engineering is a discipline that studies the properties of forces, materials, energy, fluids, and motion, as well as how to use those features to create products that progress the society and enhance people's lives.
            The development and commercialisation of the vehicle were considered to be the profession's greatest accomplishment of the 20th century.
            Albert Einstein proved that the mechanics of objects moving with high speed (speed of light) could not be explained with Classical mechanics, and henceforth he developed the theory of Relativistic mechanics.
            The theory of Quantum mechanics has been developed to explain the behaviours of particles with an atomic length scale. The base of Quantum mechanics was laid by Schrodinger (1887—1961) and de Broglie (1892-1965).
            According to Newton's second law of motion, the force acting on an object is proportional to the time rate of change of momentum. Newton's third law is the law of action and reaction.
            A vector's magnitude is increased by the amount by which it is multiplied by a positive scalar. The vector's sense of direction is altered when multiplied by a negative scalar.
            If a particle maintains its initial state of rest or maintains a constant velocity while initially in motion, it is said that the particle is in Equilibrium.
            ouple is defined as two parallel forces that have the same magnitude, but opposite directions and are separated by a perpendicular distance d. A moment of a couple is the moment produced by a couple.
            Thermal equilibrium is the state that two (or more) systems reach after being in communication with one another through a diathermic wall and is defined by constrained values of the systems' coordinates.
            A process is referred to as adiabatic if there is no heat transfer occurring. The word adiabatic originates from the Greek term adiabatos, which means not to be transmitted. A process can be adiabatic in one of two ways:
            According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may only change forms during a process; it cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, during a procedure, every amount of energy should be taken into account.
            A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between any two points is independent of the path taken by the particle.
            Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the interaction of forces, movements, and statical states in a continuous medium.

            Lesson Summary
                Machines are beneficial by changing the amount of force or the speed of action. A simple example of a machine can be a claw hammer. 
                Friction is the resistance that one surface offers to another surface as it moves across it. The nature of the two surfaces and the forces holding them together affect how much friction there is.
                A bearing is a support and guide that shuttles one or more moving machine components. It keeps the immobile part and any moving pieces in their normal position.
                A mechanism that can mechanically add and subtract is a gear differential. To be more precise, we should say that it adds the total revolutions of two shafts.
                Any mechanism that connects two parts is referred to as a coupling. Shaft couplings come in a variety of designs, and they can be used to join line shafts that are made up of multiple shafts of various lengths.
                To avoid vibration problems, minimise excitation forces via balancing or mass balancing, and avoid force propagation by isolating or absorbing vibrations.
                The mechanical design creates mechanical parts, components, products, or systems. The mechanical design includes creating numerous machine elements such as shafts, bearings, clutches, gears, and fasteners.
                Hydraulic machines and tools use liquid fluid power to do simple tasks. Heavy machinery is a typical example. Hydraulic fluid is carried throughout the machine to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders, where it becomes pressurised based on the resistance present.
                Lesson Summary
                    One application of jet impact is the generation of energy. The effect of the jet is used to rotate the turbine, namely the Pelton wheel in the generator: The force applied by the water jet is tangential to the wheel.
                    A hydraulic turbine is a machine that converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. The hydraulic turbines are also known as water turbines. The hydraulic turbine can be categorised into two.
                    In a reaction turbine, the total energy at the inlet of a turbine is kinetic energy and pressure energy. It is used for the low head of water. The Francis and Kaplan turbines are inward and axial flow reaction tur

                    Application of Solidification
                    The backbone of the real industrial environment is workshop practice, which helps develop and improve critical technical hand skills required by technicians working in various engineering sectors and workshops.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    The gating system is the passageway that transports the molten metal into the mould chamber. A gating system comprises four parts: a pouring cup, a down gate or sprue, a runner, and an ingate.Parting line gates, bottom gates, horn gates, branch gates, and top gates are examples of gates. 
                    A riser (or feed head) is a hole in the cope. Its primary function is to feed molten metal into the casting as it solidifies, compensating for shrinkage. The risers also act as an enormous vent for generated steam and gases and a loose sand or slag collection point.
                    Gates, Risers and Cores in Casting
                    Cores are sand bodies used to generate hollow parts or cavities of a desired shape and size in a casting. In addition to developing internal cavities in the casting, the cores perform the following functions:
                        The cores may be used to construct a complete mould.
                        The cores may be used to form a part of a green sand mould.
                        The cores strengthen or improve a mould surface.
                        The cores may be used as a part of the gating system.
                    Depending upon their position, the various cores are horizontal cores, vertical cores, balanced cores, drop cores, and cover cores or hanging cores.
                    Types of Casting Processes
                    Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set. This will raise the production cost. Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish.

                    Sand moulds, too, are incapable of maintaining tighter tolerances and a clean surface finish. The following casting procedures may be utilised to achieve these requirements:

                    Slush Casting
                    Die Casting
                    Permanent mould casting is a casting created by gravity pouring molten metal into a mould composed of some metallic alloy or other substance of permanence. This technique of casting is also known as die casting.
            list-icon2
        Die Casting Machines
        Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine
        The melting pot is a vital feature of a hot chamber die casting machine. At pressures ranging from 7 to 14 MPa, molten metal is driven into the die cavity. The pressure can be generated using compressed air or a hydraulically powered plunger. Hot chamber die casting machines are used to make zinc, tin, lead, and other low melting alloys.

        Defects in Casting
        Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal. The following are some of the flaws:
            Mould shift: It causes a mismatch between the top and bottom parts, typically at the parting line.
            Swell: It is a localised or overall enlargement of the casting caused by molten metal pressure enlargement of the mould chamber.
            Fins and flash: These are thin metal projections that are not designed to be cast. These typically appear at the mould's parting line.
            Sand wash: It commonly appears as rough bumps on the surface of casting near the ingates.
            Shrinkage in casting: It is a crack in the casting or dishing on the casting's surface caused by unequal contraction of the metal during solidification.
            Hot tear: It is a ragged internal or exterior discontinuity in a metal casting caused by inhibited contraction shortly after the metal has set.
            Sand blow or blowhole in casting: It is a dip on the outside surface of an exceptionally smooth casting.
            Honeycombing or slag holes in the casting: These are smooth depressions on the casting's upper surface. They are frequently seen around the ingates.
            Defects in Casting
                Scabs: These are sand patches on the casting's upper surface.
                Cold shuts and misruns: These arise when the mould cavity is not filled, resulting in a bad casting.
                Pour short: This casting flaw occurs when the mould cavity is not filled due to a lack of metal.
                Run-outs and bust-outs: These allow the metal to drain from the hollow, resulting in unfinished castings.
                Introduction
                Workshop technology is the branch of technology that deals with the many processes involved in manufacturing machine or equipment components. 

                This topic is intended to provide the learner with the information, abilities, and mindsets needed to accomplish fundamental workshop tasks.
                Electric Resistance Welding & Its Types
                Pressure Welding
                Controlling Current Quantity
                Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage (from 6 to 10 volts only), and high amperage (ranging from 60 to 4000 amperes) electr
        onferrous metals. This method yields castings with a dense and fine-grained structure.
        Electric Resistance Welding
        The following are the numerous forms of electric resistance welding:
        Spot welding
        Projection welding
        Butt welding
        It is used for welding lap joints and joining components composed of plate material ranging in thickness from 0.025 mm to 1.25 mm. The plates to be linked are sandwiched between two copper or copper alloy electrode points. It should be noted:
        • The electrode tip diameter.
        • The distance between the plate's nearest edge and the centre of the weld should be at least 1.5d.
        • The distance between two spot welds s
        rc Welding - Types & Processes
        Arc welding is a fusion welding procedure that generates heat by striking an electric arc between the work (or base metal) and on electrode. The heat produced by the electric arc has a temperature range of 6O00°C to 7OOO•C. 
        Arc welding can be done with direct current (D.C.) and alternating current (A.C.): however, direct current is recommended for most applications.
        The welding set-up is considered to have straight polarity when the work is connected to the positive terminal of a D.C. welding machine and the negative terminal to an electrode holder. When the work is connected to the negative terminal and the electrode to the positive terminal, the welding set-up is said to have reversed polarity. 

        Straight polarity is preferred for some welds, whereas reversed polarity is preferred for others. Depending on the type of electrode, there are two forms of arc welding:
            Un-shielded arc welding: Un-shielded arc welding is when a large electrode or filler rod is utilised for welding.
            Shielded arc welding: Shielded arc welding is performed when welding rods covered with fluxing material are employed.
        hould not be less than 3d, and it should be equal to I, where I is the thickness of the plate to be welded.
        as Welding & Types of Flames
        It is a type of fusion welding in which heat is generated by the combustion of fuel gas. Oxygen and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals (C2H2). The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200° C. The following are the essential equipment necessary for oxy-acetylene gas welding:
        Welding Torch
        It is sometimes referred to as a blowpipe, a device for mixing the proper amounts of oxygen and acetylene and then burning the mixture at the end of a tip, producing a high-temperature flame. Welding torches are commercially available in two varieties:
        Injector Or Low-Pressure Type
        Positive Or Equal Pressure
        Injector or low-pressure type: The injector or low-pressure type welding torch runs at less than 7 kN/m2 acetylene pressure. The chemical reaction between water and calcium carbide produces this low-pressure acetylene at the welding site (CaC2). However, depending on the tip size, the oxygen is delivered at pressures ranging from 70 to 280 kN/m2.
        uipment Necessary For Oxy-Acetylene Gas Welding
        Welding Torch Tip
        The tips ore mode of materials with high thermal conductivity, such as copper or copper alloy. Each welding torch usually comes with interchangeable tips for different thicknesses.
        Pressure Regulators
        Hose And Hose Fittings
        Gas Cylinders
        Gas Welding Technique & Oxygen Cutting
        The usual gas welding techniques in oxy-acetylene welding are as follows:
        Leftword Or Forehand Welding
        The welding torch is held in the operator's right hand, with the tip pointed to the left, and the weld is mode from right to left. The torch forms a 6O• - 70° angle with the plate, while the welding rod forms a 30• - 40° angle. Welding plates thicker than 6mm are not cost-effective with this technology.
        Right-Word Or Back-Hand Welding
        Vertical Welding
        Linde Welding
        Measuring Instruments in Mechanical Engineering
        Mechanical engineering measuring instruments are dimensional control instruments used to determine the exact size of an object. These gadgets are adjustable and can measure with an accuracy of 0.001 mm or better. The gouges are not graded and have set dimensions. There is no changeable component for measuring different lengths and angles in most cases. Following is a brief discussion of several essential measuring devices and gouges:
        Outside Micrometre
        It is mainly used to measure the outer diameter of work or the length of a small port to 0.01 mm accuracy.
        Inside Micrometre
        Screw Thread Micrometre
        Depth Gauge Micrometre

        ntroduction
        While studying engineering, specifically mechanical and civil engineering, it is very important to know the basics of engineering drawing. Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item. In this topic, we will briefly introduce ourselves to the basics of engineering drawing.
        Drawing
        A drawing is a graphical presentation of an actual object, an idea, or a suggested design that will eventually be built. 
        Drawing can take many different shapes, but the graphic manner of representation is a fundamental, inherently natural way of conveying ideas that is ageless and universal.
        Types of Drawing
        There are mainly two types of drawing;
            Artistic Drawing.
            Technical or Engineering Drawing.
        The Definition of Engineering Drawing
        A graphical language that engineers and other technical members associated with the engineering profession use to thoroughly and precisely express the specifications for engineered objects are known as an engineering drawing. It is a representation of a three-dimensional item in two dimensions.
        In other words, engineering drawing is the process of accurately portraying a real or imagined object utilising some graphics, symbols, characters, and numbers with the aid of engineering drawing tools.
        Engineers and technologists use it. An engineering drawing contains all the details regarding the objectls size, shape, type of surface, materials, etc. For example, circuit diagrams for electrical and electronics engineers, building drawings for civil engineers, machine drawings for mechanical engineers, computer graphics for everyone, et
        Feeler Gauge
        Instruments for Drawing
        The most common instruments used for engineering drawing are:
            1. Drawing board (Approximately 20" x 20"), drafting table, or desk.
            T-square (24", transparent edge)
            Set of instruments
            450 triangle (8" side)
            300 x600 triangle (10" long side)
            Irregular curve
            Pencils (2B, FIB, 31-1)
            Protractor
            Eraser
            Dusting brush
            Drafting tape
            Circle and ellipse templates.
            ow to Read Drawings
            An engineer must be able to tell what an engineering drawing is portraying drawn by another engineer. This is known as reading a drawing. To read drawing, one must understand how engineers use lines, dimensions, and notes
            You can see that each line has special importance that you must comprehend to accurately interpret a drawing. Let's talk about some of the most significant types.
            Lines
                A visible line—also referred to as an object line, is used to indicate an item's edges that are visible to the viewer.
                Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
                Often, some lines are drawn on the exposed surfaces of a section drawing. These are section lines and are used to display various types of materials.
                Dimensions
                Engineers use lines to describe an object's form or shape, but they use dimensions to express its full size. There are two different kinds of dimensions used in drawings: size and location.
                A size dimension displays an object's or a fraction of an object's size, as suggested by their names, and a location dimension describes the placement of features. The adjacent figure displays examples of both size and

        Three Dimensional Drawing
        Isothermic Drawing
        An isometric drawing is the illustration of the object in the image. The term "pictorial drawings" refers to the family of three-dimensional perspectives. 
        The width and depth planes' horizontal lines in an isometric drawing are represented at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, while the object's vertical lines are drawn vertically. 
        The lines parallel to these three axes are drawn using these rules and are drawn at their true (scale) lengths. A line will not be its actual length if it is not parallel to these axes.
        "Assembly" Drawings
        Pillow-block Image
        The first image is an isometric view of a pillowblock bearing system that has been assembled. It closely matches what you see when looking at the thing from a specific angle. 
        From this angle, it is impossible to determine how the part looks on the inside
        We can also show isometric views of the pillow block being taken apart or disassembled in this next image.
        This allows you to see the inner components of the bearing system, Isometric drawings can show the overall arrangement clearly but not the details and dimensions
        Disassembled Pillow-block
        A cross-sectional view portrays a cut-away portion of the object and is another way to show hidden components in a device.
        Imagine a plane that cuts vertically through the centre of the pillow block, as shown in the figure above. 
        Then imagine removing the material from the front of this plane, as shown in the figure belo
        Correlations of Lengths and Diameters
        The correlations of lengths and diameters are better seen in this orthogonal cross-sectional view (section A-A, figure on the right). Compared to isometric drawings, these drawings are simpler to produce. It takes some time, but experienced engineers can read orthogonal designs without requiring an isometric drawing. 
        The top "outside" view of the bearing is shown in the figure on the right. It is an orthogonal (perpendicular) projection. Notice the direction of the arrows for the "A-A" cutting plane.
        Drawing Tools
        Both manual drafting tools (figure below) and computer-aided drafting or design, or CAD, can be used to create drawings. No matter what design tool you choose to make the drawings, the fundamental drawing standards and practices are the same. 
        We shall approach learning about drafting from the standpoint of manual drafting. A freehand sketch is a drawing that was created without the use of any tools or CAD software.
        Lesson Summary
            Sand moulds can be used to cast both ferrous and nonferrous metals, however, they can only be used once because the mould is destroyed once the metal has been set.
            Defects in a casting might be caused by pattern and moulding box equipment, moulding sand, cores, gating system, or molten metal.
            Pressure welding is a type of electric resistance welding used to connect sheets of metal or wire. The welding heat is created at the required weld spot by a relatively short duration, low voltage, and high amperage.
            Oxygene and acetylene are the most commonly utilised gas combinations for producing a high flame for welding metals. The oxy-acetylene flame produces an approximate flame temperature of 3200 degrees C.
            Typically, the purpose of an engineering drawing is to clearly and accurately capture all geometric features of a product or component so that a manufacturer or engineer can produce the required item.
             The most common instruments used for engineering drawing include; drawing board, protractor, eraser, drafting tape, T-square, irregular curve, etc.
            Hidden lines in a drawing are used to show the edges of something concealed and other items hidden to the naked eye, but they are present in the structure. It is evident that the more hidden lines there are, the more difficult it becomes to decipher what is what.
            One of the issues of three-dimensional drawing is that it is often difficult or sometimes almost impossible to draw the interior details of the inside of an object.

        Learning Outcomes
        After completing this module, you will be able to:
            Explain slab centring, beam reinforcements, and beam arrangements in building technology
            Identify the positive and negative bending moments that act on beam reinforcements
            Describe the processes used in slab reinforcements
            Discuss the systems for staircase placement, shuttering and reinforcements
            Translate electrical drawings and electric conduit installation diagrams
            Lesson Summary
            The key points from this module are:


            Practical procedure for arranging of beam bottom and slab centring
            The slab centring plates, beam bottom and beam sides will be supported by using wooden or steel props. When a load is placed on the props, the load will be transferred uniformly to the slab.
            The process for placing the slab reinforcements include:
                First step – Shorter horizontal bars are laid first.      Second step – The distribution bars are laid next.
                Third step – involves adding the top extra bar           Fourth step – Mark the crank distance
                Fifth step – Once the crank distance has been marked, a distribution bar will be placed at the centre portion. The bars in the shorter direction would be laid below the bars placed in the longer direction.
            After placing the slab reinforcements, other activities to be carried out at the site include:
            1.   Creating the staircase riser and thread.                      2.   Placing of staircase shuttering and reinforcement

            3. Placing the electrical conduit on the slab                     4.     Placing of plumbing sleeves in sunken slab
            Lesson Summary
            5.   Complete casting of slab and staircase: A sunken slab level is cast lower than the main slab so that the plumbing lines/fittings can be laid inside the sunken slab. The entire length of the slab will be cast in one day.

            6.   Curing of slab at the construction site

            7.   Deshuttering of beam sides, beam bottom and slab centering – After three days of slab casting, the slab centering plates can be removed. The props will be put back in their original position after the slab centering plates are removed. Whereas, the beam bottom will take at least 7 days before removal. The props will also be put back in their original position after the beam bottom has been removed.
            Beam design (beam data and material grades for beam design)
            Single reinforced section – This refers to the practice where reinforcements are provided only at the tension region. The purpose of providing reinforcement here is to hold the stirrups.

            Double reinforced section – If the reinforcement is provided both at the compression and tension regions, it is called a double reinforced section. This reinforcement will take part in load carrying and support of stirrups.
            The bending moment of a beam: When the shear force is at maximum value, the bending moment will be zero. Whereas, where the bending moment is zero, the shear force will be at maximum value.
            Learning Outcomes
            After completing this module, you will be able to:
                Indicate the safety practice from the design and construction points of view
                Highlight the importance of the bill of quantities in structural engineering projects
                Discuss the importance and application of the general notes in structural drawings
                Lesson Summary
                The key points from this module are as follows:

                Safety from the construction point of view
                ●  For a structural engineer, safety comes before economy. While working at a site, safety is the first priority.

                ●  While working at heights, always wear safety belts.

                ●  The safety shoes, reflector, and helmet are a must for a structural engineer.

                ●  Carry out quality checks including worksite information and general housekeeping, personal protection, etc.
                Examples of safe work practice at the site are as follows:
                ●   Shielding the protruded ends of reinforcement at the site.                      ●   Proper zoning of materials at the site.
                ●   Safety nets to prevent accidents dues to falling.
                Outline the building construction process with practical demonstrations and examples
        Lesson Summary
        Safety from the design point of view will consider:
            The major failures of buildings occur due to construction failure and not a design failure.
            We consider enough factors of safety (FOS) for concrete and steel.
            We overestimate the load coming on the building and underestimate the strength of the material.
            Consider the load factor of safety and the material factor of safety.
            Consideration of the safe bearing capacity of the soil.
            The consideration of the size of footing, column dimensions, etc.
        A building is categorized into substructure and superstructure.
        Substructure - The part of the building below ground level, like the PCC, footing and column, up to the plinth level.
        Superstructure - The part of the building that is above ground level e.g., ground floor column, ground floor roof, first-floor beam, etc.

                                            Lesson Summary
                                            Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                Arrangement questions make use of factorials. A factorial is displayed as: 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24
                                                To find the expected value you can multiply the chance of a certain outcome against the outcome and add that all together.
                                                There are 3 separate definitions for calculating the probability of simple events. The classical definition (equal likelihood methods) is used when there is an equal probability of any item happening (rolling a die), the relative frequency definition is used when you have to experiment multiple times to calculate the probability and the subjective definition is used when you have to take a guess at the outcome (sports events or elections).
                                                When finding whether events are independent you can this of it as the probability of both events is equal to the probability of one events happening tims the other or P(CnB) = P(C) x P(B).
                                                A tree diagram is used to visually display all possible outcomes when calculating probability. Working backwards along a tree diagram is also known as Bayes’ Theorem.
                                                The sum of all possible probabilities must always equal a positive 1. To find the mean value of the experiment is to add up each possible outcome that is mul
                                                Lesson Summary
                                                Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                    Normal distributions are shown as symmetrical with the equally likely probability of events happening. Positive distributions are skewed to the left and negative distributions are skewed to the right. The probability of being within one standard deviation of the mean is 68%.
                                                    Binomial distributions always work with 2 possible outcomes. You can work with outcomes that are either dependent on the previous outcome or independent events.
                                                    When given the number of trials and a successful outcome in an exam question you can determine that you are being asked about binomial distribution, questions will rarely plainly say they are asking about binomials. In Microsoft Excel, you can use the built-in functions to calculate the probabilities and mean of binomial outcomes.
                                                    Cumulative frequency (CF) is used when you want to group things together, like lengths of cucumbers. CF is always found on the y-axis. When plotting the CF the line that you can draw to show the increase is referred to as the ogive curve. You can also use this graph to find the median (also known as the Q2), lower and upper quartiles. With this information, you can then create a box and whisker plot.
                                                    To find the mean of a data set find the sum through addition and divide that total by the number of values in that data set.
                                                    Lesson Summary
                                                    Having studied this module you are now able to:
                                                        When finding the frequency of ranges from a histogram you use the frequency destiny, which will also be how to find the area of the shape on the graph.
                                                        In stratified sampling, you look at the population and split them into smaller groups to find the probability. Cluster samples are more like a random sample, here you select a group to sample within the entire population. A quota sample is similar to the cluster sample, but you also want to add a specific group to be tested.
                                                        Studying the relationship between 2 variables is known as correlation. Scatter diagrams can be used to visually inspect the relationship. There are both positive and negative correlations.
                                                        A more precise measure of correlation is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, which is usually represented by an ‘r’. In Microsoft Excel, you can calculate this coefficient using an inbuilt function.
                                                        Any straight line, also known as the line of best fit, has the formula y = ax + b (where a is the gradient of the line and b is the intercept). There should always be a point that is the average of the x data and one that is the average of the y data. Excel has built-in functions to find the equation of this line.
                                                tiplied by the possibility of each outcome.

        Identify the key elements of active listening that improve communication.
        Describe the benefits of effective listening in personal and professional contexts.
        Explain the role of non-verbal cues in building strong communication.
        Outline the ways non-verbal communication influences relationships and career growth

    Lesson Summary
    The following are the key points covered in the module:

        Active listening entailed eye contact, summarizing key points, and assuming an open body position to gain the speaker's perspective. It also involves attention, a lack of distraction, and the reception of verbal and nonverbal messages.
        Active hearing has many benefits, such as learning new things, making connections, understanding, and bonding. To avoid interruption and personal experience, one must make a conscious effort, practice, and train one's focus.
        While informative hearing collects information for judgment, critical listening judges and analyzes information for judgment, appreciative listening is motivated by enjoyment and amusement, and sympathetic listening empathizes and identifies with the speaker's feelings.
        Nonverbal clues, such as body alignment and facial expressions, guide interactions. Being aware of these cues allows for more successful interactions.
        Hand gestures, voice tone, physical touch, posture, and eye contact are essential. Positive cues improve connection and empathy; negative ones might impede communication.
        Improving relational dynamics depends on a self-awareness of nonverbal communication. Learning these signals will enhance confidence and professional contacts.

        Lesson Summary
        The following are the key points covered in the module:
            Emotions can impede successful communication in various ways, including spoken, written, nonverbal, and visual, resulting in potential misinterpretations based on the receiver's perception of words and nonverbal clues.
            The delivery of messages depends on tone and inflexion. Good communication calls for authenticity.
            Detaching the ego helps one avoid "loaded" conversations assigning blame.
            "Unloaded" communication stresses sharing personal emotions free from accusations—that is, "I feel...".
            Unchecked emotions like insecurity and rage can compromise communication efficacy and clarity.
            Understanding how emotions affect ideas and behavior, building self-awareness, and applying self-reflective questions to clarify one's thoughts help one control emotions properly. Furthermore, stopping before significant talks and emphasizing controlling emotional triggers to reach the intended results are crucial.
            Good communication calls for verbal and nonverbal signals, including the conversational emotional tone.
            Understanding unclear or abrupt communication requires an awareness of underlying emotions.
            Giving time for emotions to calm enables more fruitful conversations.
        e shows warmth and captures an audience. Managing difficult circumstances requires awareness of others' nonverbal signals.

                Career Progression and Salary
                The career ladder for software engineers differs from company to company. Each level on this ladder is given a different name by the company. For example, a software engineer at Meta starts at E3 and climaxes at E9, while the lowest level in Google is L2 and their highest is L11.
                Level 2 - Internship and Apprenticeship
                When you get an internship, you'll be placed at this level. Many organizations also place their apprentices at this level. Apprentices are people who did not come into tech from the traditional route. They may have gone through a boot camp, learned by themselves, or moved through a path that does not involve a traditional education (a degree). They can also be people who transition into software engineering from a non-tech role. An apprentice would spend about 6 months to a year at L2 before moving to L3.
                An intern is expected to be someone willing to learn and take on assignments. He/she would be assigned a mentor to guide their learning for about 3 to 6 months. When you start as an intern, you should meet with your mentor almost every day for guidance. Don't be surprised if the work you are given is data entry or testing.

                Level 3 - Junior Software Engineer
                These are Junior engineers, usually fresh out of college, boot camp, or self-taught, who are looking for their first real-world experience in a full-time role. They are often required to learn at least one programming language, such as Java, PHP, or Cotlin, and understand the technologies and methodologies associated with that language. They work under the direction of a team lead. A junior engineer is often given small pieces of work that may have little significant impact on a software project - (feature level impact) and may be supervised through their work.

During the 3-6 months you'll work as an intern, the company will evaluate you as though you were a new level 3 enginndustry, build your skills in a practical environment, develop work ethics, and learn when and how to seek help
                Even with this difference in the numbering of each level, the responsibilities they carry and the requirements for promotion are the same. Most companies use a leveling structure similar to Google’s, so the career progression outlined in this topic is based on their model. The career progression discussed here is for individual contributors.

        For instance, they may be given a small feature to implement along with a description of how the feature works, the steps they should take to implement it as well as resources they'll need. As time progresses, perhaps in a year or two, your team would trust you more to build entire features on your own and would not hold your hand as much as when you were new. At this point, depending on the organization, you may need to focus on more than just the feature you're working on. You would consider the software architecture, monitoring the application, and how your code or feature fits with the goals of the project. Note that in this role you will mostly be writing code. If you work in a bigger company, you should expect more handholding and large amounts of resources for any project or task. On the othe

        Introduction
        Many of us can write functional code. We may have learned to do so at a boot camp, taught ourselves, or spent 4 years in university jumping from one project to another. But simply writing code doesn’t make someone a professional software developer—if it did, that would be too easy! So, what separates a hobbyist programmer from a professional one? Software engineering. Anyone can become a software engineer(SWE). Many shy away from this role, “saying it's too complex,” yet others jump into it all the same. Whether you've been in the tech industry or just came in, we developed this course to successfully prepare you for this role.
        As you examine this topic, try to understand:

    What is Software Engineering?
    To the outside world, software engineering seems like a job of just writing code after code and nothing more. In fact, some people even enter this career thinking that's all they'll do—write code. We have Hollywood, of course, to thank for this common misconception. If you have worked in any tech role, you'll notice that your function and responsibilities are not limited to one task, and software engineering is no different. Writing code is just one aspect of it.
    Software engineering is a process used to develop, design, test, and maintain software using standardized methodologies and processes to make sure it meets client goals and requirements. You can think of it as a process to build software systems from scratch to finish. This process, in itself, is ‘Software Engineering’
    Software Engineering Principles - 1
    Modularity
    Professional software engineers build and manage large software systems. To make them easy to scale and manage, they use a principle called ‘modularity.’ Modularity is the practice of breaking down software into smaller parts that can be scaled and maintained independently. This allows engineers to work on one part of the software without affecting the rest.

    Software Engineering Career Paths
    Software engineers are also qualified to work in various other roles in the tech industry. This is as a result of their diverse skill sets. There are multiple career paths you can choose to follow. The exact job opportunities available to a software engineer can vary. They depend on factors like location, area of specialization, and individual skill set. Note that you would not need to stay forever in the role you chose from the onset of your career. For example, if you choose to start out as a front-end engineer, you may decide to switch to the backend. The point to note is that you are not required to spend your whole work life on one career path in software engineering.
    Types of Software Engineers - 1
    Frontend Engineer
    A front end engineer builds and optimizes the user interface (UI) of applications. This means front-end engineers develop and maintain the part of software that users see and interact with, which is often called the ‘client side’ of software. For instance, in the case of YouTube, the interface is the part you see and interact with. (e.g., the subscribe and like button) are designed, positioned, and built by front-end engineers.

    Data Engineer
    A data engineer works on software systems that acquire and use large volumes of data. They build and manage the systems (often called data pipelines) that collect, store and analyze large volumes of data. They make sure that these systems that move data from one place to another within the software are efficient, reliable, and scalable. This allows them to prepare the data for analysis which would enable organizations to make informed high level business decisions.

        Daily Responsibilities of SWEs - 1
        Throughout the software development life cycle, software engineers work on various tasks. The main responsibility of a software engineer is to develop software systems that fulfill client needs and meet business requirements. Oftentimes, the software is complex, so this responsibility is usually divided among teams. The daily responsibilities of software engineers would depend on the team they are deployed in, the project and the organization they work for. But oftentimes, these responsibilities include the following:
        Writing and Testing Code
        Software engineers spend a reasonable part of their day testing code. This involves writing code, improving code quality, fixing issues like bugs, and implementing new features.
        Code Reviews

        Design and Planning

        Meetings and Collaboration
        Software engineers attend daily meetings with other team representatives to discuss project progress, requirements, or blockers. They also work with cross-functional teams like (1)Product Managers - to align their work with project goals, timelines, and requirements. (2) Designers - to ensure that user interfaces and experiences align with the technical capabilities of the software and are visually appealing. (3)Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers - to test the software and make sure that it meets the required quality, standard, and function.

        Introduction
        In this topic, we’ll consider the professional qualifications and skills you need to become a capable software engineer. It’s important to note that while not all the skills we discuss will be relevant to every software engineering role, they apply to most roles and will make you a more versatile engineer if you develop them. As you examine this topic, try to answer this question for yourself: What technical and interpersonal skills are necessary to become a software enginee
        Your Skills
        As we considered in the previous topic, a software engineer can qualify to work in a plethora of tech positions. Their skill set is what makes this versatility possible. So, what are these skills? There are two layers of skills to note here:
            The skills necessary for the particular subset of software engineering you choose to work in.
            These are the general skills every software engineer must possess.
        For example, a machine learning engineer must have a deep understanding of data science and be proficient in mathematical concepts related to data science. These same skills may not be as important for a front-end engineer whose f
        ard Skills - 1
        Hard skills are technical skills that are learned through education, training, or hands-on experience. They can be measured for proficiency and competency. These skills are necessary for performing the specific tasks required in your role and can be demonstrated through tests and certifications. For a software engineer, the essential hard skills include the following:
        Programming Languages
        Learning how to code is likely the first technical skill that comes to mind—it’s the bedrock of software engineering.
        This skill is critical because it enables you to create software, make informed decisions, guide the technical aspects of projects in the right direction, lead code reviews, and mentor team members.
        You don’t need to master every language out there; being proficient in at least one is enough. The four most commonly used languages in software engineering are Python, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS (though technically not a programming language, it’s essential for presenting UI to users).
        Data Structures and Algorithms


        Version Control Basics (Git, GitHub/GitLab)
        Hard Skills - 2
        Database Knowledge (SQL, NoSQL)
        When building software, you'll often deal with unorganized data stored in databases.
        To properly manage this data, you'll need to understand how databases work—how to structure, retrieve, and store data efficiently. SQL is the most popular language for organizing such data, while NoSQL offers alternative approaches for unstructured data.
        Testing and Debugging



        Software Development Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Waterfall)


        Knowledge of Development Tools and Ecosystems






        Containers
        Building Hard Skills
        So now you know these skills. How can you build them? One effective way to develop hard skills is by solving creative coding challenges. You can find such challenges on platforms like:
            Advent of Code
            Codewars
            LeetCode
            HackerRank
            Exercism
        Start practicing, and you’ll see yourself improving in no time!
        Soft Skills - 1
        Soft skills are behavioral and interpersonal skills that determine how you relate to people in your workplace. Unlike hard skills, they’re not easily measured and are largely influenced by your personality. These skills are necessary to build a safe, productive, and collaborative work environment. Here are the top soft skills every software engineer should develop:
        Problem-Solving
        Your ability to solve problems is essential in every aspect of software engineering. You'll find yourself face to face with problem after problem, both technical and non-technical, such as Deadlines, Customer requirements, Bugs, Broken code, and Miscommunication
        It is important to develop the skill to approach problems thoughtfully and curate the most appropriate solutions for each one. Problem-solving is so valuable that it’s often tested during job interviews and techn
        Soft Skills - 2
        Attention to Detail
        Software engineering requires precision. You'll need to pay attention to what you do from coding and testing to debugging and documenting—every detail matters.
        Paying attention to detail minimizes mistakes and ensures accuracy in your work. Remember that computers only understand you when you tell them precisely what to do.

        Certifications and Degrees
        The traditional way to become a software engineer is to get a degree. But today, many software engineers are self-taught. Regardless of the route you choose, you’ll need a way to demonstrate your skills to employers. Certifications and degrees serve as formal proof of your expertise. You can gain these certifications and qualifications through a number of ways. These include:
            Boot camps
            Apprenticeship programs
            Professional certification programs
            University degrees
        As you examine this topic, consider these questions:
            What certifications do I need to possess?
            Should I get a degree for this role?
            Will this role be a good fit for my personality and aspirations?
            Is a Degree Necessary?
            The short answer is No! But when you look deeper, you'll see that it depends on (1) Your location. (2) The company you want to work for. For example, some companies prefer people who have a bachelor's or master's over someone who is self-taught or went through a boot camp, but these are not the majority. Most companies, though, don’t really care about your educational background as much as your skills and practical experience—your ability to do the work. Before drafting your personal learning and certification path, it’s important to research the qualifications required by the company you aim to work for. The main purpose of a degree or certification is to verify your skills and qualifications. Understanding what’s valued by your target employers will guide your decisions. In the following pages, we’ll explore each of these routes in detail.
            chelor's Degree - 1
            An undergraduate degree is one of the most common routes to becoming a software engineer. Even though it’s not required by many organizations for entry-level positions, it can give you an edge over other candidates. Some employers require candidates to hold a bachelor’s degree for specific roles to demonstrate their ability, skills, and experience in building complex systems. For senior-level positions like Lead Engineer or Senior Developer, a bachelor’s degree is often a minimum requirement.
            Bachelor's Degree - 2
            For a career in software engineering, you can pursue a bachelor’s degree in any computing-related field, such as:
                Computer Science
                Software Engineering
                Mathematics
                Data Science or Data Analytics
                Computer Engineering
            This degree involves studying one or two subjects in great detail over four (4) years of full-time study. In software engineering, your coursework would include:
                Programming
                Networking
                Software architecture
                Mathematics
            A degree in software engineering would give you a deep understanding of b
            Master’s Degree
            A master’s degree can help advance your career in software engineering, but it’s not necessary. It can be used to:
                Progress to higher positions within an organization.
                Negotiate a higher salary.
                Simplify the hiring process when transitioning between organizations.
            However, it’s important to note that your skills and experience are the major players that will help you progress in this career, not your academic qualifications. Only a few organizations require a postgraduate degree, like a master’s, for higher-level positions. Ultimately, a master’s degree can give you some benefits, yet it’s not required.

        Level 5 - Senior Software Engineer
        If you spent anywhere from 3-7 years as a software engineer you most likely would be in this position. This is a terminal role, which means that your company would no longer expect you to keep climbing the career ladder unless you want to. You can spend the rest of your career at this level. Some individuals move over to a managerial position from here; either way, it's not a requirement. The work you do now would have a team-level impact. What does this mean?

    There are many ways to get your first role as a software engineer. The kind of job you'll get would depend on your location, experience and sometimes your education. Most people who have earned a degree go for internships, which they can use to transition into a full-time role later on. Other engineers who are self-taught or graduated from a boot camp may directly apply to an entry-level position or start freelancing to build their portfolios. Either way, there are a lot of strategies you can use to secure a role regardless of the position you are gunning for. From this topic till the end of this course, we'll discuss the following:

        How to write your resume and build your portfolio
        Preparing for the Job Search - 1
        Many people would be eager to jump into the job market and start applying for jobs, but that won't get you the best results. First, you need to understand what you're getting into, so you need to research the job market. This will allow you to put yourself in your employer's shoes to know what companies are currently looking for and how to tailor your application to their needs. To do this, look at listings on job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and AngelList. Each job posting you see would normally have listed requirements for each applicant, e.g., years of experience, proficiency in a list of languages and technologies, certifications, or soft skills relevant to the role.

    Where would you like to work, Google, Microsoft, Meta or Apple? These are the goto choice for many engineers. But there are alot of other industries and companies you can work for. Some of them are easier to get into than big tech.
    Tech Startups
    These guys are on the lookout for employees that can help the company achieve its goal. To that end, you'll rarely hear of a startup asking for your certifications and degrees. Rather, they are more interested in your ability to solve real-world problems with your technical and soft skills, whether you're self-taught or a degree holder. You can prove your worth to a startup by using projects in your portfolio. We'll discuss how to build a portfolio that's attractive to employers down the line.

    Your Resume
    A recruiter would spend about 7 seconds skimming through your resume. At that time, s/he would decide if it was worth paying more attention to or casting aside. Today, many recruiting organizations use software to decide whether or not a resume is worth looking at. This software often filters out 60% of resumes. So, it is important for your resume to stand out. We'll discuss how to structure and write each part of your resume to make yours stand out. Some general points to note are:

        First, make sure your structure flows. Don’t complicate things—keep it simple, neat, and consistent. No fancy fonts or colors; just black and white is enough. Stick to what matters and avoid distractions.
        Use numbers for accomplishments. They make things clear. Show how much you’ve done and improved. If you've boosted retention, say by how much. It's all about the action. If you increase something, give a percentage. Don't hide behind words; show results.
        For education and skills, don't get caught up in dates or proficiency levels. They don’t matter here. It’s about what you can do, not how long you’ve been doing it or how good you think you are.

        You'll need an online presence in this career, not just to land your first role but to place you in a position of authority in the field. It also allows other people to see your level of skill and dedication to your work. Today, many software engineers have secured tech positions simply by having an active online presence. So, how and where can you build one? We'll discuss three platforms. In addition to these platforms, you should join developer communities on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Slack. Members of these communities who share project progress and quality content consistently have been known to receive job offers.

        First, create an account and follow the people you would like to hire. In your bio, make it transparent that you are on a journey to land your first job in the tech industry. Then, you can begin commenting on other people's tweets with encouragement and positivity. This would make people see you as really nice, and many would follow you because they want to see you succeed on your journey. 
        Once you’ve got some eyes on you, start making meaningful contributions and posts. Make threads about anything you Learn(make it clean and useful). 
        LinkedIn 

        Github
        Portfolio-Building
        Before you can get employed by a company, you'll need to prove that you can do the job. This goes beyond your certifications. You'll need to find a way to showcase your abilities in practice. A portfolio would help you do just that. So, to define it, a portfolio is a piece of document or material that showcases your work in practice. For software engineers, this is best done with a website.
        ortfolio Website
        Image by Freepik
        Image by Freepik
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates. You can develop a website that will link its visitors to projects you may have worked on or contributed to. It should also include projects hosted on your GitHub or anywhere else. Once your portfolio website is set up, you can also add projects that demonstrate your use of languages you're proficient in, internships, awards and certifications you may have received
        Keep it simple and let the content speak for itself.

    Projects on Your Portfolio - 1
    How do you get projects to put on your portfolio? Oftentimes, most engineers work on solo projects like a budget app, cooking app, student study aid, or similar software. But if you want to stand out, you should showcase paid projects you have worked on and successfully completed—projects that actually generated revenue. You can get projects like this through freelancing. This is where you offer your services for a fee to the public. When you work on a project for a client, you may add it to your list of projects along with the revenue it generated for the client in specified numbers. Spice it up by stating the challenges for each project, as well as your thought processes and methodologies for overcoming those challenges to achieve the desired result.
    Projects on Your Portfolio - 2
    As a suggestion, you can add these two projects to your portfolio:

        A website where you can log in to an account and do something with it, like upload a picture or video or send a message. Most companies have software that allows users to log in and do something on their account. Working on this kind of project would prepare you to work on software like this on a large scale.
        Another project to work on is using external APIs, such as incorporating Google Maps into a project or using web sockets for real-time messaging apps.

    Finding Job Opportunities
    When job hunting, most people would first hit listings on job boards. It can be a challenge to stand out from the thousands of daily applications on each post. If you decide to use this method, filter for the most recent posting before applying. However, there is a much better way to get job offers—real-life networking. This is where you meet people and talk with them face to face, not on the Internet. Online interactions cannot replace the magic of face-to-face conversations. In fact, most high-quality business contacts come from physical interactions with people.
    How to Network
    One way to network is through meetups. Apps like ‘meetup’ allow you to meet with other programmers in your locality, connect with them, and eat free pizza. There, you might meet someone who would help you down your career. Another popular way to network is to attend conferences. This is usually more expensive but can get you high-quality connections.
    Before attending an event, practice small talk and self introduction

    Email Outreach
    One very effective way to get a software engineering job is to directly contact an individual in the company you wish to work for. Preferably, the person you contact should have decision-making power. To do this, send a direct email letting them know you are interested in working with their organization or company.
    Here is how to structure your email: THE INTRO The first part of your email should break the ice and build some form of rapport with him/her. It should notify the receiver that you have done some research about their company and that the email would not be a waste of their time. To do this effectively, you'll need to find a way to personalize it to them and what they're working on. You can't achieve this without researching the company and individual.
    You could say: “Hey (Name), Absolutely love what you're doing with/on [project they're currently working on]. I checked you [the main technology, tool, or structure they're trying to ach
    Passing Technical Interviews (PTI)
    Below are some tips to pass software engineering technical interviews:

        It is normal to get anxious when you are given a question or challenge to solve. You can reduce your anxiety by focusing on the problem preserved in the question itself rather than whether you impress the interviewer or the stakes at hand.
        To help you calm down and process the question, read them aloud to the interviewer. Start with writing pseudo code. It'll help you break down the problem into something simpler.
        Take your time to understand the requirements, so you don't waste your time writing code you would have to change later. You could ask clarifying questions like: “am I allowed to use this library?”
        Think aloud and explain the reasoning behind your decisions throughout your process. If this is a challenge for you, practice self-talk while you code privately to be comfortable with it before the interview date.
        Everyone gets stuck somewhere while coding. The way you react to roadblocks determines whether you get an offer or not. You can do either of these two things: (1) You may ask the interviewer for clarification for uncertainty, e.g., I think I'm on the right track if I know that X will cause Y outcome, which is not desirable. How do I prevent that? (2) You can always skip an issue and come back to it later.
        DON'T CHEAT!
        Avoid language-specific magic and use modulo operations instead, as it is found in most languages. Smile and speak clearly and confidently. If acceptable in your region, a sprinkle of casualty can help loosen the tension.

    ieve], and I love the work you put int
    PTI Continuation - The Big O Notation
    Big O Notation is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its performance or resource use as the size of the input grows. During the your technical interview, it's a prompt to remind you that you might need to:
    Understand Time Complexity
    Be prepared to discuss how long your solution takes to run as the input size increases. For example:
    O(1) means constant time (very fast).
    O(n) means linear time (grows with the input size).
    O(n^2) means quadratic time (much slower for larger inputs).
    Understand Space Complexity
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 1
    Topics You'll Be Tested On
    If you're applying to companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (shortened as FAANG), you'll be confronted with problems around Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming. Certain regions will answer your questions on dynamic programming. Other types of companies, e.g., banks, might give your take-home tests or behavior-style coding interview questions. 
    It is important for you to research the interview process for your company of choice to get a better idea of what to expect. 
    Choice of Language
    Preparing for Technical Interviews - 2
    Data Structures 
    There are a handful of data structures you should have a basic understanding of before the interview; these are Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Sets, Maps, Linked Lists, Trees (binary search trees), and Graphs. You should also learn the purpose of each of these structures, their common use cases, their time complexity using Big O notation, and all the different operations like adding and subtracting elements when you should and should not use them, their pros and cons, and how to implement them.

        The industries that hire software engineers include Gaming and Entertainment, Retail and E-commerce, the healthcare industry, financial institutions like banks, and Tech Startups.
        The structure of your resume should be as follows: The Header(this should have your name), Contact Details (email address (use a professional email if you have one), phone number, LinkedIn and GitHub.), Education, Experience (For your list of experiences you may use the ‘XYZ’ Google formatting: I used X to accomplish Y that had Z results.) Projects (Include their timeframe, the challenges you overcame, and the results they got). The last section on your resume should be about your technical skills.
        Some engineers use their GitHub as their entire portfolio homepage. While this is not bad in itself, it won't give you flexibility in design like your own portfolio website and make you harder to spot in a long list of job candidates.

                Outline the platforms and technologies used in Next-generation sequencing (NGS).
                Summarize the steps for interpreting pathway analysis results.
                esson Summary
                    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the sequencing of entire genomes from single cells or from entire organisms. It has enabled us to identify and measure genetic variation, enabling us to better understand the genetic basis of diseases and other biological processes.
                    Pathway analysis is often used in conjunction with other bioinformatics techniques such as gene expression profiling, and metabolomics.
                    Network analysis and control theory uses mathematical models to study the behavior of networks. These models are used to identify and analyze network parameters, such as topology, traffic flow, and routing.
                    There are several types of machine learning used in bioinformatics, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with supervised learning being the most common type of machine learning used in bioinformatics.
                    Clinical bioinformatics is used to identify, measure, and compare clinical features in order to make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
                    Integrating clinical laboratory data into a healthcare system requires the implementation of an electronic health record (EHR). An EHR is a digital record of a patient’s health information that can be accessed by healthcare providers from any location.
                    Lesson Summary
                        Biomedical engineering is a multifaceted discipline bridging medicine, biology, and engineering, dedicated to enhancing healthcare and quality of life.
                        Ethical considerations such as patient consent and data security, are pivotal as engineers navigate advancements like genetic engineering and AI in healthcare.
                        The most significant challenge of sequence alignment and database searching is the sheer amount of data that must be compared. With millions of sequences that need to be compared and analyzed, the process can be time-consuming and computationally intensive.
                        Protein structure prediction is an important task in the field of bioinformatics. The ability to accurately predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is important for understanding protein function and for drug discovery.
                        Phylogenetic analysis is an important tool for understanding evolutionary relationships between species and for identifying their relatedness.
                        There are a variety of techniques available for analyzing gene expression. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the research question and the type of data needed

            Introduction to Dementia
            INTRODUCTION
            DEFINITION
            As a care worker, there is a good chance that the majority of your clients will be in the 70 or older age bracket. Because of this, it is important that you have an understanding of the most common conditions that clients of this age experience.
            Research shows that when you reach 70 years or older, your chances of contracting Dementia increases significantly. 
            The purpose of this section is to introduce the person with Dementia and to set a context for caring for those who have Alzheimer's disease - a disease of the brain that forever changes a person's memory, behavior and ability to care for oneself.
            gnosed with dementia.
            Symptoms of Dementia
            SYMPTOMS
            TREATABLE
            It is important that care workers are familiar with the symptoms of dementia, as an early diagnosis of the condition may decrease it’s severity over the longer term.
            The symptoms of dementia are outlined below:
             
            - Decline in memory, thinking and reasoning. 
            - Changes in personality, mood and behavior.
            - Difficulties in the ability to communicate, to recognize people and places and to engage in activities.
            - Forgetfulness - forgetting names and appointments.
            - Difficulties with once-familiar activities.
            - Impaired judgment.
            - Problems with spatial and temporal orientation.
            Types of Dementia
            ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
            Alzheimer’s is by far the most common type of dementia, attributed to  approximately 2/3 of cases. It was first identified 100 years ago.
            The onset of Alzheimer’s can be slow and subtle, followed by a gradual decline. Changes in short term memory are noticeable, i.e. memory of recent events. This is typically the primary first complaint.

            Those at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer’s include:
            The Elderly - there is an increased risk after the age of 65. By age 85 or more, there is an almost 50% risk of acquiring the disease.
            Females - females are at a greater risk of contracting the disease than males.

            Genetics - if there is a genetic history of Alzheimer’s in the family, there is a greater risk of developing the disease.

        he Stages of Alzheimer's Disease
        STAGE ONE
        STAGE TWO
        STAGE THREE
        The early stage of Alzheimer's Disease usually lasts two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawing from activities. If these symptoms are recognized and diagnosed at an early stage, it can save both the individual and their families time and hardship.
        During this stage you can expect the person with Alzheimer’s to forget experiences, rather than details (like names). The person may need minor assistance or reminders, but may be able to live alone competently. Efforts to hide confusion from others (the person usually knows something is not right) are sometimes successful at this early stage
        Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain. Symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss.
        This is similar to Alzheimer’s disease, but characterized more often by early changes in movement or the development of extra pyramidal symptoms. This includes: tremors; tics; rigidity; shuffling; gait, which can make individuals look like they have Parkinson’s disease.

        Alertness and severity of cognitive symptoms may fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis. There is often a poor tolerance to medications, as well as autonomic nervous system dysfunction. An example would be wild swings in blood pressure.
        Lewy body dementia can be challenging to diagnose because of it’s similarities to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

        Treating Dementia Symptoms
        TREATMENTS A.
        Conclusion
        GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
        When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it is administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. The administration of medication should be tailored to the individual. 

        Carers should constantly be aiming to identify links between certain behaviors and medications. Carers should employ strategies that do not require medications. Medications can and should be considered when such strategies are ineffective or not effective enough. 
        RISKS & BENEFITS
        Carers need to remember the importance of limiting the number of medications administered to patients and monitor which medications patients react well to and which ones they react poorly to. 

        It is important to provide medication in a slow and infrequent manner, because elderly people do not tolerate medications as well as younger people.
        Avoid medications with undesirable side effects, those which can cause more confusion or sedation, or worsen a patient's condition.
        Introduction to The Philosophy of Dementia Care
        INTRODUCTION
        RIGHTS
        This unit is designed to provide an overview of the philosophy and values of good dementia care based on the following concepts:
        A. People are unique and bring to the caregiving situation different perspectives and needs that shape the care environment.
        B. The essence of good Dementia care is the maintenance and enhancement of personhood within this environment. This approach to caring involves having respect for the personhood of those who have Dementia. This includes the equal respect for the personhood of those doing the work of caregiving.
        Care workers need to recognize that clients who have Dementia need to be treated the same as a client who has a broken hip. This unit will allow you to see clients who have Dementia as the patients that they really are.  
        This section focuses on medications that have been proven to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s. 
        COGNITIVE
        Aricept, Exelon, Razadyne: Indicated for mild dementia; used throughout the course of the disease. Side effects are mainly gastro-intestinal (GI) in nature, minimized by giving in the morning with food. There may also be vivid dreams or leg cramps.
        Namenda: Indicated for moderate dementia, used either alone or together with one of three medications previously noted.
        MOOD
        Antidepressants of the class known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally used. They address depression and anxiety. Medications such as tricyclics (for example, Elavil) and benzodiazepines (such as Lorazepam or Valium) should not be used because of the potential for increased confusion and dizziness and the increased risk of falls with potential injury.
        TREATMENTS B.
        The Condition of Alzheimer's Disease
        BEHAVIOURS
        EMOTIONS
        SLEEP/DELIRIUM
        When you work with a client who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (at any stage), it is important to know that their behavior can be unpredictable.
        This is often a response to discomfort, an unmet need, and increasing confusion. Patients also develop an increase in difficulty communicating, progressive loss of independence and poor insight and judgment.

        Key to reducing behavioral disturbances is to identify triggers. These include: pain; fatigue; acute illness; sensory deficits; hallucinations and/or delusions.
        Behaviors may be psychomotor (pacing, wandering, repeatedly crying out, etc.); verbal (belligerence, nastiness towards others, repetitiveness) and/or physical (combativeness, inappropriate touching). Careworkers need to be aware of these types of behaviors which can be expected from their clients. 
        Promoting a Caring Culture
        CARE CULTURE 1
        CARE CULTURE 2
        The new culture (N) of Dementia care outlined below, describes how care workers should go about their work when working with clients who have Dementia. Note how it contrasts with the old culture (O).
        O1: Dementias are diseases of the central nervous system. Personality and identity are destroyed.
        N1: Dementing illness should be seen as a form of disability. How a person is 
        affected depends on the care received.

        O2: The people with the best knowledge are doctors and brain scientists.
        N2: The people with the best knowledge are skilled and insightful caregivers.
        O3: Research is focused on a medical breakthrough. Until that comes, there is not much we can do for the person with Dementia.
        N3: There is a great deal we can do through human caring, insight and skill. This is the most urgent matter for research.

        Introduction to Working With Patients’ Families
        INTRODUCTION
        ADJUSTING
        CAREGIVING
        The purpose of this unit is to discuss the realities of working with the families and friends of the client with Dementia and to determine methods for assisting families cope.
        Watching someone progress through the stages of Alzheimer’s or other dementia is very stressful. Also, there may be guilt associated with the inability to “do more to help the person.” When working with the families of a client, it is important to remember the following:
        - Family members adjust to the client's condition in unique, individual ways.


        - The process of adjustment involves grief and loss - anticipatory grief, i.e. grieving before death occurs.
        As a caregiver you need to be aware of people's attitudes - personal biases, prejudices and stereotypes. 

        Understanding different values and being aware of cultural differences, where it's applicable, will make you a better carer.

        Where necessary, try to get information about the patient’s culture/preferences. Make sure you adapt the care to fit their preferences and demands. Diversity includes race, ethnicity (culture), nationality, religion (or none) and sexual orientation.
        At times, it can be quite difficult for care workers to empathize with a patient with Dementia. Let’s take some time to complete this exercise that could help you see Dementia from a different perspective.

        Imagine a future in which you are in your seventies or eighties and suffering from Dementia. None of your family is able to care for you at home and you have moved into residential care. In the present, you know yourself and your personal history very well. Use your knowledge about yourself as you are now to pick out the information which would help the people who care for you in this imaginary future to maintain your well-being as far as possible. What would you need to sustain your well-being?
        QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
        1.  Everyday tastes and habits: How could it help you feel more settled if your caregivers knew about them?
        2.  Your body and your health: What should they know?
        3.  Fears and past events - If they understood these, could they respond more sympathetically?
        4.  Interests and activities - How can they help you sustain your sense of independence?
        5.  Still thinking of you as an older person with dementia: What do you most dread? What is your greatest hope?
        RULES A.
        Acknowledging the Experiences of Family Members
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES A.
        FAMILY EXPERIENCES B.
        Family members can react in unique and individual ways when a loved one is diagnosed with Dementia. The most common reactions are outlined below:

        DENIAL: Reflects the initial response that nothing is wrong. Denial is a natural reaction; can prevent a family from seeking help; can create family conflict. Helpful Interventions: Provide accurate information on Dementia when appropriate; Listen without judging; Do not assume person is in denial. There may be a lack of information amongst family members.

        OVER INVOLVEMENT: The primary caregiver may try to meet all the needs of the person with memory loss and refuse help from everyone; caregiver believes they are helping; can create a barrier to getting further help. Helpful Interventions: Involve family member in care and care planning; Encourage family member to express painful feelings such as guilt, loss and anger.

        ANGER: Resulting from the physical, emotional, financial burden of providing care. Can stem from feelings of loss and abandonment. Angry feelings can cause guilt. Helpful Interventions: Discuss anger at the disease rather than at people. Encourage interaction with other families going through the experience. Listen without judging or taking sides. Encourage caregiver to take some time for his/her self.
        Lesson Summary

            Dementia refers to a spectrum of brain disorders, involving difficulty with memory and thinking; symptoms vary in their causes, courses and prognoses.
            Symptoms of Dementia include: decline in memory, thinking and reasoning; change in personality, mood and behavior; difficulty communicating, recognizing people and places and engaging in activities.
            Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of Dementia. It is progressive and irreversible. Early diagnosis and recognition of symptoms is important for care.
            When treating an Alzheimer’s patient with medication, remember that it should be administered for the benefit of the patient and not for staff convenience. 
            Vascular or Multi-Infarct Dementia, is the second most common form of Dementia, estimated to account for approx. 20% of cases. It is caused by reduced blood flow to parts of the brain, often due to tiny strokes which block small arteries.
            Fronto-Temporal Dementia causes personality and behavioral changes and loss of language function. 
            Lewy Body Dementia is caused when abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies are left in the brain; symptoms include hallucinations and memory loss. The early stage lasts for two to four years. It is characterized by forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with problem-solving and withdrawal from activities. The middle stage is characterized by increase in memory loss, confusion, shorter attention span, increase in language difficulties and repetitiveness. The late stage is a period of severe confusion and loss of all functional skills; the person has no awareness of their condition. This lasts for approx. 1-3 years and ends in death.
            Caregivers (professional or family members), must take steps to safeguard their own health and well-being when caring for

            Effective Approaches
            INTRODUCTION
            APPROACH
            This unit is designed to provide guidelines for communicating with the person with Alzheimer’s Disease. This unit expands on the culture of care section and suggests practical applications for handling communication by using the “soft approach” and redirecting the person with Dementia, where possible, to produce a more positive interaction.
            In communicating with the person with Dementia, you will need to:
            - Introduce yourself by name/association.
            - Validate responses and feelings verbally.
            - Use short simple sentences.
            - Ask primarily yes/no questions.
            - Allow time for responses.
            Verbal and Non-Verbal Techniques
            VERBAL
            NON-VERBAL
            In the early, and for part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person with Dementia. They allow you to redirect the person to achieve a more positive interaction.
            Consider the following example. The client says:
            Scenarios: Self-Reflection Exercise
            COMMUNICATION SCENARIO A.
            The following scenarios represent situations that will allow you to consider the communication techniques necessary when treating clients with Dementia. 
            CASE SCENARIO ONE: Margaret at Bedtime
            Laurie was assigned to assist Margaret with getting ready for bed. Margaret was accustomed to putting her nightgown on by herself and was very shy about being undressed. Laurie knocked on the door and entered Margaret’s room to assist her. She found Margaret had put her nightgown on over her clothes. Laurie didn’t think that Margaret would be comfortable sleeping in her clothes, so she wanted to convince Margaret to take off the nightgown. Margaret resisted and Laurie began using a hands-on approach to help her. Since Margaret’s ability to communicate is moderately impaired and she was unable to express her fears and frustration, she became increasingly agitated. She tried to tell Laurie that she was shy and embarrassed, but could not verbalize her feelings and instead pushed Laurie away and threw the nightgown on the floor.


            QUESTIONS:
            (a) What would you do to help Margaret cope with her escalating behavior, help restore her dignity and provide assistance in getting ready for bed?
            (b) Think about this scenario and determine which communication
            “My mother is coming to get me.” If you said, “No, your mother died years ago,” the client would either begin to grieve for her or refuse to believe what you are saying. Instead try something like: “You must miss her. What kind of work did she do?” or “What things did you enjoy doing together?”
            These statements allow the client to respond to the idea of the lost person and go with the flow of the ideas. Direct the client to think about positive memories of the person, rather than the idea that their mother is no longer aliv

            - Use word cues - try to guess what the person want

        Communicating with Colleagues
        If you are providing care to a patient with Dementia in a formal setting (i.e working for a care agency), chances are that you administer care to your patient with the support of at least one of your colleagues. It is vital to maintain a professional and healthy relationship with your colleagues. If you fail to do so, it will effect the standard of care you can provide to your patient. 
        Follow the tips outlined below in order to maintain a healthy relationship with your colleagues:
        Maintain good eye contact.
        Speak clearly and directly.
        Use the person’s name whenever possible.
        Use a friendly tone of voice. 
        Ask for repetition or clarification if you are unclear about a message. 	Never yell or discuss client care in front of that client or other people
        Carefully report critical information related to a client's achievements and challenges.
        Take notes when a
        Teamwork
        It is important to remember that one person cannot administer care to a person with Dementia. It takes a team. This team will not always be a formal team consisting of coworkers. It can also consist of family members or friends. 
        To build a strong team, follow the T.E.A.M. guidelines below:
        Trust yourself and others. Trust builds a sense of acceptance of others. Trust creates confidence in self and others. Trust establishes a “safe harbor” and feelings of security.
        Empower yourself to be your best. Empowering gives permission to excel. Empowering challenges your ability to be creative and innovative. Empowering authorizes you to explore your talent and uniqueness.	Attitude can be your best friend (you decide). Attitude creates positive and negative reactions. A “Can do” attitude motivates others. Attitude reflects your true character.
        Model teamwork to others. Modeling good teamwork is an example for others. Modeling exhibits a sense of cooperation. Modeling encourages others to be “team minded”

        Dealing with Difficult Behaviour
        INTRODUCTION
        CAUSES
        APPROACH
        Caregivers need to be aware of the types of behaviors they are likely to encounter when working with clients with Dementia. 
        This unit defines “problem” behaviors commonly seen and provides methods for assessing, preventing and dealing with difficult situations.
        COMMON BEHAVIORS:
        - Resisting/fighting hands-on caregivers
        - Wandering and rummaging
        - Physical restlessness
        - Eating problems
        - Sleep disturbances
        - Disruptive yelling or moaning
        - Problematic sexual behavior/ disrobing
        Effective Approaches to Care
        INTERVENTION
        COMFORT
        ANTICIPATE NEEDS
        Do not intervene when a person with Dementia is exhibiting “problem” behavior, unless one of the following applies:


        - The behavior violates the rights of others.
        - The behavior poses a threat to someone’s health and safety.
        When it is necessary to intervene, make sure you do so in a manner that does not endanger the client or other people.
        Turning Negatives into Positives
        SOLUTIONS A.
        It can be useful to engage the client in personally meaningful activities that draws their attention away from upsetting and distressing situations. Examples include:
        - Offer something to eat or drink.
        - Go for a walk; go outdoors.
        - Talk in a calm, soothing way.
        - Play music; sing a song.
        - Look at pictures.
        - Say a prayer; sing a hymn.
        - Pleasant exercise.
        - Reminiscing.
        Therapeutic Activities
        INTRODUCTION
        ACTIVITIES
        BENEFITS
        GUIDELINES
        In this unit, you will learn that activities are the foundation of care. Every event, encounter or exchange is an activity. The scope of activities includes everyday interactions with staff, volunteers, relatives and other individuals.

        In this topic, you will learn how to determine which type of activity is best to suit your client at different times. You will examine activities that are suited to all forms of Alzheimer’s in particular. However these can be used for clients with other forms of dementia.

        The activities that make up a client's daily experience should reflect as much as possible that person's preferred individual lifestyle, whilst enabling a sense of usefulness and success at their level of functioning.

        Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disease. The person with dementia has difficulty doing, or is unable to do, the things that he/she previously enjoyed doing. Cultivating activities with meaningful interactions for the person with memory loss is part of providing successful experiences.
        Lesson Summary

            When communicating with a person with Dementia, one should: introduce oneself by name and association; validate responses and feelings verbally; use short simple sentences; ask primarily yes/no questions; allow time for responses; use word cues; try to guess what the person wants.
            In the early and part of the middle stages of Dementia, verbal techniques may be used to calm and reassure the person. This allow you to redirect the person and to achieve a more positive interaction with them.
            When communicating with a client, the goal is to avoid situations likely to create anxiety and conflict, as both will cause the client stress.
            Caregivers must be proactive by anticipating the client's needs ahead of time, especially since clients may not be able to verbalize their needs.
            The activities that make up a client's daily experience, should reflect as much as possible that person's individual preferences. They should enable a sense of usefulness and success at as normal a level of functioning as is possible.
            Activities should help to maintain the independence and physical well being of patients and enhance their quality of life, by providing them with mental stimulation and opportunities to engage in socialization.
            The guidelines for choosing activities include selecting activities that are interesting and stimulating and that consider the person's individuality and environment.
            One person only cannot administer care to a person with dementia; it takes a team.

            SUCCESS
            In 2006, Californian vocalist Colbie Caillat was an aspiring singer-songwriter. Although her audio engineer father, Ken Caillat, coproduced one of the biggest selling albums of all time, Fleetwood 
            Mac’s Rumours, Colbie had never considered booking a studio, much less campaigning for a record deal.

            TWITTER
            Social networking sites, such as MySpace and virtual worlds, such as Second Life, make it easier for fans to search for new music and easier for artists to
            communicate with their fans. 
            In fact, MySpace has been so influential that it has teamed up with several major labels, to create the MySpace music website. Generating a buzz on social networking sites is sometimes enough to achieve fame and stardom. 


            She considered her music to be a hobby rather than a career choice. [1] Fast-forward a year later and Caillat’s debut album, Coco, was at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, on its way to achieving platinum status. How did an unknown artist from Malibu, California, become a best-selling star in so little time? Caillat’s success can be attributed, in part, to the social networking website 'MySpace'.

        Early Music Technology
        PHONOGRAPHS
        The first stirrings of popular or pop music—any genre of music that appeals to a wide audience or subculture—began in the late 19th century, with discoveries by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner.
        In 1877, Edison discovered that sound could be reproduced using a strip of tinfoil wrapped around a rotating metal cylinder. Edison’s phonograph provided ideas and inspiration for Berliner’s gramophone, which used flat discs to record sound.
        Copyright and New Music Genres
        COPYRIGHT
        POPULAR GENRES
        In the late 19th century, the lax copyright laws that existed in the United States at the beginning of the century were strengthened, providing an opportunity for composers, singers, and publishers to work together to earn money, by producing as much music as possible. 
        Numerous publishers began to emerge in an area of New York that became known as Tin Pan Alley. Allegedly named because the cacophony of many pianos being played in the publishers’ demo rooms sounded like people pounding on tin pans. 
        Tin Pan Alley soon became a prolific source of popular music, with its publishers mass-producing sheet music to satisfy the demands of a growing middle class.

        RADIO
        Radio was an affordable medium that enabled listeners to experience events as they took place. Better yet, it offered a wide range of free music that required none of the musical skills, expensive instruments, or sheet music necessary for creating one’s own music in the home, nor the expense of purchasing records to play on the gramophone.

        This development was a threat to the entire recording industry, which began to campaign for, and was ultimately granted, the right to collect license fees from broadcasters. With the license fees in place, the recording industry eventually began to profit from the new technology.
        The Tin Pan Alley tradition of song publishing, continued throughout the first half of the 20th century, with the show tunes and soothing ballads of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. This included songwriting teams of the early 1950s, such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. 
        By hiring songwriters to compose music based on public demand and mainstream tastes, the Tin Pan Alley publishers introduced the concept of 'popular music' as we know it.

        BIG JAZZ BAND
        INTEGRATION
        BLUES
        Jazz became a "legitimate form of entertainment" during the 1930s, when white orchestras began to incorporate jazz style into their music. 
        During this time, jazz music began to 
        take on a big band style, combining elements of ragtime, black spirituals, blues, and European music. 

        Key figures in developing the 'big jazz band' included bandleaders Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, and Glenn Miller. These big band orchestras used an arranger, to limit improvisation, by assigning parts of a piece of music to various band members. 
        Electric Guitar and Radio
        ELECTRIC GUITAR
        RADIO STATIONS
        Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, were the first to electrify the blues, through the use of electric guitars and to blend an urban style with classic Southern blues. 

        The electric guitar, first produced by Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931, changed music by intensifying the sound and creating a louder volume that could cut through noise in bars and nightclubs. [4] 
        By focusing less on shouting, singers could focus on conveying more emotion and intimacy in their performances. This electrified form of blues provided the foundation for rock and roll.

        RECORDS
        Technological advances during the 1940s, made it even easier for people to listen to their favorite music and for artists to record it.
        The introduction of the reel-to-reel tape recorder, paved the way for several innovations that would transform the music industry. 
        The first commercially available tape recorders were monophonic, meaning that they recorded sound onto magnetic tape, using only one track. This may seem limiting today, but at the time it allowed for exciting innovations.

        PAYOLA
        During the 1940s, a mutually beneficial alliance between sound recording and radio existed. Artists such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald profited from radio exposure. Until this time, music had primarily been recorded for adults, but the popularity of Sinatra and his contemporaries revealed an entirely untapped market: teenagers. 

        The postwar boom of the 1930s and early 1940s, provided many teenagers with the spending money for records. Radio airplay helped to promote and sell records and the recording artists themselves, which in turn stabilized the recording industry. The near-riots caused by the appearance of New Jersey crooner Frank Sinatra in concert, paved the way for mass hysteria among Elvis Presley and Beatles fans during the rock and roll era.
        Rhythm and Blues
        R & B
        Technology wasn’t the only revolution that took place during the 1950s. The urban Chicago blues, typified by artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, and B. B. King, surged in popularity among white and black teenagers alike.  
        Marketed under the name rhythm and blues, or R&B, the sexually suggestive lyrics in songs such as “Sexy Ways” and “Sixty Minute Man”; the electrified guitar and wailing harmonica sounds, appealed to young listeners.

        Prior to 1964, rock and roll was primarily an American export. Although U.S. artists frequently reached the top of the charts overseas, few European artists achieved success on the U.S. side of the Atlantic. 
        This situation changed almost overnight, with the arrival of British pop phenomenon the Beatles. Their music combined elements of skiffle—a type of music played on rudimentary instruments, such as banjos, guitars, or homemade instruments—doo-wop and soul. The four "mop-haired" musicians from Liverpool, England, created a genre of music known as Merseybeat, named after the River Mersey
        Although banned from some stations, others embraced the popular new music. In 1951, DJ Alan Freed started a late-night R&B show called 'The Moondog Rock & Roll House Party' and began referring to the music he played as rock and roll. [5] 
        Taking its name from a blues slang term for sex, the music obtained instant notoriety, gaining widespread support among teenage music fans and widespread dislike among the older generation. [6] 
        Frenetic showmen Little Richard and Chuck Berry were early pioneers of rock and roll, and their wild stage performances became characteristic of the genre. 
        Emerging Genres
        SOUL MUSIC
        In Detroit, some black performers were developing a sound that would have crossover appeal with both black and white audiences. Combining R&B, pop, gospel, and blues into a genre known as soul, vocalists such as James Brown and Aretha Franklin sang about the lives of black Americans. 

        Producer and songwriter Berry Gordy Jr., developed soul music through the creation of his Motown label, which would become one of the most successful businesses owned by a black person in American history. [10]
         
        Capitalizing on the 1960s girl-group craze, Gordy produced hits by the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas and, most successfully, Diana Ross and the Supremes. For his bands, he created a slick, polished image, designed to appeal to the American mainstream.

        GANGSTA RAP
        RIVALRY
        In the early 1980s, a second wave of rap artists brought inner-city rap to American youths, by mixing it with hard guitar rock. Pioneered by groups such as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, the new music appealed to black and white audiences alike.
        Another subgenre that emerged was gangsta rap, a controversial brand of hip-hop, epitomized by West Coast rappers such as Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur. Highlighting violence and gang warfare, gangsta rappers faced accusations that they created violence in inner cities—an argument that gained momentum with the East Coast–West Coast rivalry of the 1990s.
        Whereas many British youths expressed their displeasure through punk music, many disenfranchised black American youths in the 1980s, turned to hip-hop—a term for the urban culture that includes break dancing, graffiti art, gangs and the musical techniques of rapping, sampling, and scratching records.

        COMPACT DISCS
        MP3s
        In the mid-1990s, CD sales were booming. Cassette tapes were all but obsolete, and record companies were reaping the benefits of sales to consumers, who wanted their music collections in the latest technological format. 
        This boom was a familiar step in the evolution of technology. In past decades, records seemed to have an ironclad lock on sales, but they were eventually surpassed by cassette sales. Cassettes were then surpassed by CD sales. 
        However, despite a few advantages in quality and convenience, there were several areas in which CDs were lacking. They were expensive for consumers to purchase, and consumers had to buy a full album, even if they were only interested in listening to one or two songs, because every album came as a complete package.
        In Weezer’s 2008 song “Pork and Beans,” vocalist Rivers Cuomo sings, “Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts...Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art.” [1] 
        The lyrics, a reference to hip-hop producer Timbaland’s multiple high-profile collaborations, are an angry reaction to a meeting between Cuomo and record executives at the band’s Geffen label. 
        During the meeting, the executives told the band members they needed to write more commercial material, prompting a defiant (though commercially successful) response. [2] 
        The tight-knit relationship between music and culture is almost impossible to overstate. For example, policies on immigration, war, and the legal system, can influence artists and the type of music 
        they create and distribute. 

        Music may then influence cultural perceptions about race, morality, and
        gender that can, in turn, influence the way people feel about those policies.

        Reacting against the extravagance of disco, many poor urban "rappers" developed a new street culture, by adopting a casual image consisting of T-shirts and sportswear. 
        They developed a language that reflected the everyday concerns of people living in low-income urban areas and embraced the visual art form of graffiti. They described their new culture as hip-hop, after a common phrase chanted at dance parties in New York’s Bronx borough.
        MUSIC
        After the Vietnam War ended, college students began to settle down and focus on careers and families. For some, selfish views took the place of concern with social issues and political activism, causing writer Tom Wolfe to label the 1970s the “me” decade. [13] 
        Musically, this ideological shift resulted in the creation of glam rock, an extravagant, self-indulgent form of rock that incorporated flamboyant costumes, heavy makeup, and elements of hard rock and pop. 
        A primarily British phenomenon, glam rock was popularized by acts such as Slade, David Bowie, the Sweet, Elton John, and Gary Glitter. 
        Having earned himself a reputation as a political spokesperson, Dylan was
        lambasted by traditional folk fans, for playing an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.
        However, his attempt to reach a broader crowd, inspired the folk rock genre, pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds [11]. Even though many fans questioned his decision to go electric, Dylan’s poetic and politically charged lyrics were still influential, inspiring groups like the Beatles and the Animals. 
        File Sharing and Napster
        FILE SHARING

        LAWSUITS
        FIGHTBACK
        Initially done only by a tech-savvy elite, the process of downloading and sharing audio files was a painstaking process, because MP3 files were not in one centralized location. 
        Peer-to-peer file sharing—the process in which two or more computer
        systems are connected over the Internet, for the purpose of sharing music or video files—became a worldwide phenomenon in 1999, with the development of the centralized online file-sharing system 'Napster'.

        iTUNES STORE
        Not content with pursuing providers of illegal music downloads, the RIAA also took legal action against the users of sites such as LimeWire and Kazaa. In 2003, the recording industry sued 261 American music fans, for illegally sharing songs on P2P networks. [7] 

        Although fines under U.S. copyright law can rise up to $150,000 per illegally downloaded track, most of the cases were settled for much less. In 2008, the RIAA had sued or threatened to sue more than 30,000 individuals for copyright infringement. [8]
        The Gnutella network, which serves clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX, avoided maintaining a central database. 
        Instead, it dispersed information about file locations, across computer “nodes” around the world. Users were able to find each other, but the service could disclaim the ability to prevent copyright infringements. 
        The lack of a centralized server and multiple client base meant that, unlike Napster, it would be impossible to shut down the entire Gnutella network through a simple court order. Courts would need to block all Gnutella network traffic at the Internet service provider (ISP) level of the Internet, a far trickier prospect than simply shutting down a central database.
        Most recording artists sided with the record labels, with heavy metal rock group Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre launching their own separate lawsuits against Napster in April 2000. However, some bands discovered a way to use the site to their advantage.
        Alternative rock group Radiohead promoted its album 'Kid A', by secretly releasing the record to Napster, 3 weeks before its street release date, creating a wave of publicity that launched the album to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart in October 2000. [4] 
        Reggae-rock band Dispatch poured free recordings onto the site, increasing its fan base to such an extent that it sold out multiple nights at Madison Square Garden in early 2007. [5]

        Several companies have attempted to cash in on the success of iTunes, with varying results. In 2007, Internet giant Amazon.com launched the Amazon MP3 digital music download store, that initially offered more than 2 million songs, priced between $0.89 and $0.99. [11] 
        Amazon’s major selling point was its lack of digital rights management (DRM) software, which enabled music downloads to be played on any hardware device. 
        In contrast, songs downloaded through iTunes, could only be played on Apple products. Apple removed these restrictions in 2009, after negotiating an agreement with the major record labels.

        ADVANTAGES
        iPOD
        Once digital music technology was introduced to the world, its domination of the music industry was almost instantaneous. 
        MP3 players have several key advantages over CD players. They are smaller and more portable, eliminating the necessity of lugging around bulky CD carrying cases. 
        Whereas CDs can only hold a relatively small amount of data, MP3 players are able to compress thousands of songs onto a single device (however, this lack of packaging and manufacturing has caused disputes between artists and labels over royalties). 

        The lack of moving parts, means MP3 players can be taken jogging or cycling, without the risk of a song skipping every time the user hits a bumpy patch of road. Users are also no longer obligated to buy entire albums; instead, they can pick and choose their favorite songs from a catalog of online music.
        Module One Summary

            Popular music as we know it, originated out of the Tin Pan Alley tradition that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century in which composers, singers, and publishers worked together to create hit songs. 
            Whereas classical music was exalted for its individuality and stylistic differences, popular music is praised for conforming to the tastes of the audience.
            Technological developments played a crucial role in bringing popular music into people’s homes. 
            The invention of the phonograph and gramophone in the late 19th century, enabled the reproduction and mass distribution of sound recordings. 
            The invention of the reel-to-reel tape recorder and the development of vinyl records in the 1940s, significantly improved the music recording process. 
            The postwar prevalence of radio, hugely impacted popular music, with radio airplay of popular songs promoting record sales.
            Jazz and blues originally emerged from New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s. As many people migrated to Northern urban areas for economic reasons, this had an impact on the kind of music that was created.

                In 1983, radio station WOXY’s new owners bought the station and changed its format from a Top 40, to an up-and-coming alternative rock format, kicking off with U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday.” [1] 
                Then located in the basement of a fast-food restaurant in Ohio, the station was a risk for its purchasers, a husband and wife team, who took a chance by changing the format to a relatively new one. 
                Their investment paid off with the success of their station. By 1990, WOXY had grown in prestige to become one of Rolling Stone magazine’s top 15 radio stations in the country and had even been made famous by a reference in the 1988 film Rain Man. [2] 

                In 1998, the station launched a web cast and developed a national following, ranking 12th among Internet broadcasters for listenership in 2004. [3]

            HISTORY
            Wireless technology made radio as it is known today possible, but its modern, practical function as a mass communication medium had been the domain of other technologies for some time.  

            As early as the 1880s, people relied on telephones to transmit news, music, church sermons, and weather reports. In Budapest, Hungary, for example, a subscription service allowed individuals to listen to news reports and fictional stories on their telephones. [11] 

            Around this time, telephones also transmitted opera performances from
            Paris to London. In 1909, this innovation emerged in the United States, as a 'pay-per-play' phonograph service in Wilmington, Delaware. [12] This service allowed subscribers to listen to specific music recordings on their telephones. [13]
            When Marconi popularized wireless technology, contemporaries initially viewed it as a way to allow the telegraph to function in places that could not be connected by cables. 
            Early radios acted as devices for naval ships to communicate with other ships and with land stations; the focus was on person-to-person
            communication. 
            However, the potential for broadcasting—sending messages to a large group of potential listeners—wasn’t realized until later in the development of the medium.
            AMATEUR RADIO
            At its most basic level, radio is communication through the use of radio waves. This includes radio used for person-to-person communication, as well as radio used for mass communication. 
            Both of these functions are still practiced today. Although most people associate the term radio, with radio stations that broadcast to the general public, radio wave technology is used in everything from television to cell phones, making it a primary conduit for person-to-person communication.

        DEVELOPMENT
        After the World War I radio ban was lifted, with the close of the conflict in 1919, a number of small stations began operating using technologies that had developed during the war. 
        Many of these stations developed regular programming schdules, that included religious sermons, sports, and news. [16] As early as 1922, Schenectady, New York’s WGY, broadcast over 40 original dramas, showing radio’s potential as a medium for drama.
        The WGY players created their own scripts and performed them live on air. This same groundbreaking group also made the first known attempt at television drama in 1928. [17]

        In the mid-1920s, profit-seeking companies such as department stores and newspapers, owned a majority of the nation’s broadcast radio stations, which promoted their owners’ businesses. [23] 
        Nonprofit groups, such as churches and schools, operated another third of the stations. As the number of radio stations outgrew the available frequencies, interference became problematic, and the government stepped into the fray.
        The Radio Act of 1927 established the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), to oversee regulation of the airwaves. A year after its creation, the FRC reallocated station bandwidths to correct interference problems. 
        Not long after radio’s broadcast debut, large businesses saw its potential profitability and formed networks. In 1926, RCA started the National Broadcasting Network (NBC). 
        Groups of stations that carried syndicated network programs, along with a variety of local shows, soon formed its Red and Blue networks. 
        Two years after the creation of NBC, the United Independent Broadcasters became the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and began competing with the existing Red and Blue networks

        PRIME TIME
        The so-called Golden Age of Radio occurred between 1930 and the mid-1950s. Because many associate the 1930s with the struggles of the Great Depression, it may seem contradictory that such a 
        fruitful cultural occurrence arose during this decade. 

        However, radio lent itself to the era. After the initial purchase of a receiver, radio was free and so provided an inexpensive source of entertainment that replaced other, more costly pastimes, such as going to the movies.
        Radio also presented an easily accessible form of media that existed on its own schedule. Unlike reading newspapers or books, tuning in to a favorite program at a certain time became a part of listeners’ daily routine, because it effectively forced them to plan their lives around the

        NEWS
        WW2
        By the late 1930s, the popularity of radio news broadcasts had surpassed that of newspapers. Radio’s ability to emotionally draw its audiences in close to events, made for news that evoked stronger responses and, thus, greater interest than print news could. 
        For example, the infant son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Radio networks set up mobile stations that covered events as they unfolded, broadcasting nonstop for several days and keeping listeners updated on every detail, while tying them emotionally to the outcome.

        Despite the networks’ hold on programming, educational stations persisted at universities and in some municipalities. They broadcast programs such as the School of the Air and College of the Air, as well as roundtable and town hall forums. 
        In 1940, the FCC reserved a set of frequencies in the lower range of the FM radio spectrum, for public education purposes, as part of its regulation of the new spectrum. 
        The reservation of FM frequencies gave educational stations a boost, but FM proved intitally unpopular, due to a setback in 1945, when the FCC moved the FM bandwidth to a higher set of frequencies, ostensibly to avoid problems with interference. [12] 
        The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and ushered in a new era of government regulation. The organization quickly began enacting influential radio decisions.
        Among these was the 1938 decision to limit stations to 50,000 watts of broadcasting power, a ceiling that remains in effect today. [9] 
        As a result of FCC antimonopoly rulings, RCA was forced to sell its NBC Blue network; this spun-off division became the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1943. [10]

        Early radio network programming laid the groundwork for television’s format, with many different programs that appealed to a variety of people, broadcast at different times of the day. 
        As television’s popularity grew, however, radio could not compete and so it turned to fresh programming techniques. A new type of format-driven station became the norm. Propelled by the development of new types of music, such as psychedelic rock and smooth jazz, the evolution of radio station formats took place. 
        Since the beginning of this shift, different stations have tended to focus on the music that certain demographics prefer to hear. 
        MEXICO
        CONTROVERSIAL
        Another important innovation in radio in the U.S. was the growth of border stations. Located just across the Mexican border, these stations did not have to follow FCC or U.S. regulatory laws. 
        Because the stations broadcast at 250,000 watts and higher, their listening range covered much of North America. Their content also diverged markedly from that of U.S. stations.

        POP
        Pop contemporary hit radio, or pop CHR, is a subformat of contemporary hit radio (CHR). Other sub-formats of CHR include dance CHR and rhythmic CHR. Branded in the 1980s, this format encompassed stations that had a Top 40 orientation, but drew on a wide number of formats, such as country, rock, and urban. [4] 
        In 2010, pop CHR ranked first among teenage listeners, with 65 percent of its overall listeners aged under 35. This music, ranging from popular artists like Taylor Swift and Kanye West to Shakira, was played in the car more than at home or work and saw its largest listening times in the evenings. Rhythmic CHR, a subformat focusing on a mix of rhythmic pop, R&B, dance, and hip-hop hits, also ranked high in 2010. [5]
        Country music as a format includes stations devoted both to older and newer country music. In 2010, the country music format stood as the most popular radio format, beating out even such prominent non-music formats as news and talk. 
        The format commanded the greatest listener share and the second largest number of stations dedicated to the style. Favored in rural regions of the country, the country music format—featuring artists like Keith Urban, the Dixie Chicks, and Tim McGraw—appeals to both male and female listeners, from a variety of income levels.

        Since its inception, radio’s impact on American culture has been immense. Modern popular culture is unthinkable without the early influence of radio. 
        Entire genres of music that are now taken for granted, such as country and rock, owe their popularity and even existence, to early radio progr

        VOX POP
        INTEGRATED
        CONSUMERISM
        Radio programs reflected the nationwide cultural aspect of radio. Vox Pop, a show originally based on person-in-the-street interviews, was an early attempt to quantify the United States’ growing mass culture.
        Beginning in 1935, the program billed itself as an unrehearsed “cross-section of what the average person really knows”, by asking random people an assortment of questions. 
        Many modern television shows still employ this format, not only for viewers’ amusement and information, but also as an attempt to sum up national culture. [1] 'Vox Pop' functioned on a cultural level, as an acknowledgement of radio’s entrance into people’s private lives, to make them public. [2]

        BROADCASTING
        Although technological advances in the past 50 years, such as audio recorders and microphones, have made creating radio programs easier, finding a way to broadcast programs, presents a difficulty for the average person. 
        The technology of the Internet, however, has transformed this limitation, into a manageable hurdle for both businesses and individuals.
        STREAMING



        CUSTOMIZED
        Developed around 2001 to help terrestrial radio stations compete with emerging satellite radio technology, HD radio is essentially a digital transmission of radio signals, resulting in less static and better sound quality, even for AM stations. 
        Upgraded quality is not the major benefit of HD radio, however; the technology allows signals to be compressed, so that one station can air so-called "shadow stations" on the same frequency as its regular broadcast. 
        Although listeners need a HD radio to receive these channels, they pay no subscription fee, as independent stations provide their own programming, as they deem necessary. [3]
        Although the future of radio has been doubted many times throughout its history, it is still in existence. The inherent portability of the medium, gives it an advantage over other types of media, 
        that require an individual’s full attention, such as television or print. 

        The simplicity of radio has leant itself to a variety of uses. In recent years, new technologies have promised to expand the reach of radio and to expand the kinds of programming it offers. Satellite and HD radio have increased the amount and diversity of available programming, by making more stations available. 
        Internet radio has increased the accessibility of radio communication, and practically anyone who has access to a computer, can create subscription podcasts to distribute around the world. These new technologies promise to
        make radio an enduring, innovative form of media.

        SUCCESS
        Unlike Internet radio, podcasting employs downloadable rather than streamed content. The term podcasting, stems from the use of MP3 players, such as Apple’s iPod. 
        Many terrestrial stations have employed podcasting to supplement their traditional over-the-air broadcasting. Because these are single programs, rather than continuous streaming, podcasts are an easier medium to produce than Internet radio.
        Just as radio evolved from a medium for soap operas and live music to talk shows and recorded music, podcasts are a window into what radio may evolve into in the future.
        Despite the rise of Internet radio over the past several years, its success has never been a sure thing. As the trend gained momentum, many inexperienced broadcasters confronted the issue of 
        royalties, and many experienced broadcasters encountered new legal issues related to streaming. 

        Stations that broadcast over the airwaves must pay publishing royalties to the musicians and songwriters behind the recordings. Rather than pay an individual musician or songwriter each time a recording is played, however,
        broadcasters—including radio stations, coffee shops, and restaurants—pay for a blanket license, that allows them to play any song. 
        Lesson Summary

            The Golden Age of Radio covered the period between 1930 and 1950. It was characterized by radio’s overwhelming popularity and a wide range of programming, including variety, music, drama and theater programs.
            Top 40 radio, arose after most non-music programming moved to television. This format used short playlists of popular hits and gained a great deal of commercial success during the 1950s and 1960s.
            FM radio became popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, as commercial stations tried to appeal to new audiences, who desired higher fidelity and a less restrictive format.
            Empowered by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, media conglomerates have subsumed an unprecedented number of radio stations, merging them into single corporations. 
            Radio station consolidation tends to bring more predictability and profits, at the expense of independent programs.
            Radio station formats (interviews, news, music etc.) tend to use particular advertising products to target their particular audience demographic.
            Contemporary hit radio was developed as a Top 40 format and expanded beyond pop music to include country, rock and other genres.
            Spanish-language formats have grown in recent years, with the 'Mexican Regional' format moving into the to
            Nostalgia genres have developed to reflect the tastes of aging listeners, including music mixes from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
            Radio is unique as a form of mass media, as it has the potential to reach anyone, even the illiterate. 
            Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events directly to the listening public and was used to create a sense of national unity.
            Radio encouraged the growth of popular music stars and brought regional sounds to wider audiences. 
            The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated that radio stations must give equal time to contrasting points of view.
            An enormous rise in the popularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, when commentators were free to broadcast a biased perspective.
            The need for radio stations to generate revenue, places practical limits on what radio personalities can say on the air. 
            Shock jocks such as Howard Stern and Don Imus, test and sometimes exceed "acceptable limits". They have become controversial personalities, highlighting the tension that exists between freedom of speech on the one hand and the need for business to be profitable on the other.
            Radio’s flexibility as a medium, has allowed it to survive the fluctuations of audience tastes and markets.
            Satellite radio, as a monthly subscription service, provides access to unlimited, commercial free and uncensored broadcasting.

                In 2009, many moviegoers were amazed by the three-dimensional (3-D) film Avatar. Avatar grossed over $1.8 billion in theaters worldwide; $1.35 billion from 3-D sales alone. [1] 
                Following in that vein, dozens of other movie studios released 3-D films, resulting in lesser box office successes, such as Alice in Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, and Shrek Forever After. Many film reviewers and audiences seemed adamant—3-D movies were the wave of the future. 

                Throughout the history of film, Technicolor dyes, enhanced sound systems, and computer-generated graphics have boasted huge box-office revenues; however, it’s ultimately the viewers who determine what a good movie is and who set the standard for future films.

            MARKETING
            PROMOTION
            In the movie industry today, publicity and product are two sides of the same coin. Even films that get a lousy critical reception can do extremely well in ticket sales, if their marketing campaigns manage to create enough hype. Similarly, two comparable films can produce very different results at the box office, if they have been given different levels of publicity. 
            This explains why the film 'What Women Want', starring Mel Gibson, brought in $33.6 million in its opening weekend in 2000. However, a few months later, 'The Million Dollar Hotel', starring Gibson, only brought in $29,483 during its opening weekend. [1] Unlike in the days of the Hollywood studio system, actors alone no longer draw audiences in to see movies. 
            The first technology for home video recording, Sony’s Betamax cassettes, hit the market in 1975. The device, a combined television set and videocassette recorder (VCR), came with the high price tag of $2,495, making it a luxury still too expensive for the average American home. 
            Two years later, RCA released the vertical helical scan (VHS) system of recording, which would eventually outsell Betamax, though neither device was yet a popular consumer product. 
            Within several years however, the concept of home movie recording and viewing was beginning to catch on. In 1979, Columbia Pictures released 20 films for home viewing and a year later Disney entered the market with the first authorized video rental plan for retail stores. 
            While the development of narrative film was largely driven by commercial factors, it is also important to acknowledge the role of individual artists who turned it into a medium of personal expression. 
            The motion picture of the silent era was generally simplistic in nature; acted in overly-animated movements, to engage the eye; accompanied by live music, played by musicians in the theater and including written titles, to create a mood and to narrate a story. 
            Within the confines of this medium, one filmmaker in particular emerged to
            transform the silent film into an art and to unlock its potential as a medium of serious expression and persuasion; D.W. Griffith.

            STUDIOS
            ADVERTISING
            The Hollywood “dream factory,” as Hortense Powdermaker labeled it in her 1950 book on the movie industry, [3] manufactures an experience that is part art and part commercial product. [4]  The films the studios churn out, are the result of a capitalist enterprise that ultimately looks to the “bottom line” to guide most major decisions. 
            Hollywood is an industry and as in any other industry in a mass market, its success relies on the control of resources, access to mass distribution and effective marketing strategies. This helps to maximize the product’s reach and to minimize competition. [5] In this way, Hollywood has an enormous influence on the films to which the public has access to.
            Costs and Models
            COSTS
            While it may seem that the major studios are making heavy profits, movie making today is a much riskier and less profitable enterprise than it was in the studio system era. 
            The massive budgets required for the global marketing of a film, are huge financial gambles. In fact, most movies cost the studios more to market and produce—upwards of $100 million—than the returns generated at the box-office. 
            With such high stakes, studios have come to rely on a handful of blockbuster films that keep them afloat, [8] movies such as Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean and Avatar. [9] 
            Lesson Summary
                Early motion picture technology was first introduced to a mass audience through Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope in 1891.
                It wasn’t until the Lumière brothers released the Cinématographe in 1895, that motion pictures were projected for public audience viewing. 
                Film established itself as a popular form of entertainment in the United States, with Nickelodeon theaters in the 1910s.
                By 1915 most of the major film studios had moved to Hollywood in California, because of cheaper land and better outdoor filming conditions.
                D.W. Griffith’s silent film 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), presented a racial perspective on the U.S. Civil War and its aftermath and caused much controversy.
                The release of 'The Jazz Singer' in 1927 marked the birth of the talking film. By 1930, silent films were a thing of the past. 
                Technicolor emerged in film in the 1930s and found early success with movies such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind.
                The majority of films would continue to be made in black and white, until the late 1950s.
                    During the Golden Age of Hollywood (1920s - 1960s), the major studios controlled all aspects of the movie industry, from production to distribution and the movie theaters themselves. The audience numbers that regularly attended movie theaters during this period, has not been surpassed.
                    During World War II, film production was monitored by the government and tended to promote a patriotic, pro-war sentiment.
                    After World War II, the power of the studio system declined, as a result of antitrust legislation and the invention of television.
                    In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rise in films that celebrated the emerging youth culture and the rejection of conservatism, with films such as Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Easy Rider. This movement also encouraged looser attitudes towards sexuality and violence in film. 
                    After the failure of the Vietnam War (1975), films began to reflect a more ambivalent attitude toward war.
                    The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the blockbuster movie and bigger advertising budgets, with films such as Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather.
                    A film’s performance at the box office is often directly related to the marketing and advertising budget that promotes it.
                    The widespread use of the VCR in households in the 1980s, reduced movie theater attendance, but opened up a new mass market of home movie viewers.
                        Improvements in computer animation and digital effects in the 1990s, led to the success of films such as The Matrix, Jurassic Park and the first fully computer-animated film 'Toy Story'.
                        Movies and culture tend to have a symbiotic relationship, i.e. both reflect and influence each other. 
                        Movies are a powerful medium and audiences can adopt the attitudes and styles of the characters they watch on screen. 
                        Because of the high marketing and production costs, the major film studios have increasingly come to rely on blockbuster films to keep themselves profitable.
                        Independent films became more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, in part because they represented a break from the predictable material released by the big studios.
                        The VCR was replaced by DVDs in the late 1990s and by the Blu-ray Disc in the 2000s, when digital video sales and renta

                            In November 2007, more than 12,000 film, television and radio writers working in the United States, went on strike for fairer pay. 
                            Lasting for more than 3 months, the strike disrupted many hit shows in 2008 and cost the Los Angeles economy $2.5 billion. [1] 

                            While production for many television shows was on hiatus, several industry executives were thinking of new ways to reach their audience. Declaring that it was “time to change the face of Show Business as we know it,” Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator, Joss Whedon started writing a three-part musical series, specifically designed to be released on the Internet.

Shortly after the free viewing, the tragicomic musical was made available for purchase on iTunes, where it reached No. 1 on the video chart, totaling 2.2 million downloads per week. The soundtrack was also released via iTunes, obtaining the No. 1 spot on the first day of its release and debuting at No. 39 on the 'Billboard 200' chart. 

                        Capitalizing on the musical’s online success, Whedon authorized the creation of a DVD, which was released exclusively through Amazon.com on December 19, 2008. It reached the No. 3 position on Amazon’s movie and television sales. 
                        Television's Influence
                        IMPACTS
                        Since replacing radio as the most popular mass medium in the 1950s, television has played such an integral role in modern life that, for some, it is difficult to imagine being without it. 
                        Both reflecting and shaping cultural values, television has at times been criticized for its alleged negative influences on children and young people and at other times lauded for its ability to create a common experience for all its viewers. 
                        Early Television Technology
                        SYSTEM
                        CRT
                        SCANNER
                        Inventors conceived of the idea of television long before the technology to create it had appeared. Early pioneers speculated that if audio waves could be separated from the electromagnetic spectrum to create radio, so too television waves could be separated to transmit visual images. 
                        As early as 1876, Boston civil servant George Carey envisioned a complete television system and submitted drawings for a “selenium camera”, that would enable people to “see by electricity” a year later. [3]
                        In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used both the CRT and the mechanical scanner system, in an experimental system. With the CRT in the receiver, he used focused electron beams to display images, transmitting crude geometrical patterns onto a screen. The mechanical disk system was used as a camera, creating a primitive television system.

                        COMMERCIAL
                        LIMITATIONS
                        From early experiments with visual transmissions, two types of television systems came into existence: mechanical television and electronic television. 
                        Mechanical television developed out of Nipkow’s disk system and was pioneered by British inventor John Logie Baird. In 1926, Baird gave the world’s first public demonstration of a television system, at Selfridge’s department store in London. 
                        At the same time Baird was developing the mechanical model, other inventors were working on an electronic television system based on the CRT. While working on his father’s farm, Idaho teenager Philo Farnsworth realized that an electronic beam could scan a picture in horizontal lines, reproducing the image almost instantaneously. 
                        Electronic Television
                        TRANSMISSION
                        In 1927, Farnsworth transmitted the first all-electronic television picture, by rotating a single straight line scratched onto a square piece of painted glass, by 90 degrees.

                        Farnsworth barely profited from his invention. During World War II, the government suspended sales of television sets and by the time the war ended, Farnsworth’s original patents were close to expiring.
                        However, following the war, many of his key patents were modified by RCA and were widely applied in broadcasting, to improv

                        CONCEPT
                        PULLED
                        When television was in its infancy, producers modeled the new medium on radio. Popular radio shows such as police drama 'Dragnet' and western cowboy series 'Gunsmoke', were adapted for television. 
                        New television shows were sponsored by single advertisers, just as radio shows had been. Television was dominated by three major networks—NBC, ABC and CBS. These networks accounted for more than 95 percent of all prime-time viewing, until the late 1970s. 

                        Today, the television industry is far more complex. Programs are sponsored by multiple advertisers and programming is controlled by major media conglomerates. The three major networks no longer dominate the airwaves, but instead share their viewers with numerous cable channels. Several factors account for these trends within the industry, including technological developments, government regulations and the creation of new network
                        Since its inception as an integral part of American life in the 1950s, television has both reflected and nurtured cultural mores and values. 
                        The escapist dramas of the 1960s, consciously avoided controversial issues and glossed over life’s harsher realities, in favor of an idealized portrayal of life.
                        In more recent years, many television shows

                        DATA
                        The experience of watching television is rapidly changing with the progression of technology. No longer restricted to a limited number of channels on network television, or even to a television schedule, viewers are now able to watch exactly what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.
                        Non-television delivery systems such as the Internet, enables viewers to download traditional television shows onto a computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone and this is changing the way people watch television. 
                        Meanwhile, cable and satellite providers are enabling viewers to purchase television shows to watch at their convenience, through the use of video-on-demand services. This has changed the concept of prime-time viewing.
                        Lesson Summary
                            Two key technological developments in the late 1800s played a vital role in the evolution of television: the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk. 
                            The cathode ray tube, invented by German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897, was the forerunner of the television picture tube. It had a florescent screen that emitted a visible light (in the form of images) when struck by a beam of electrons. 
                            The scanning disk, invented by German inventor Paul Nipkow, was a large, flat metal disk that could be used as a rotating camera. It served as the foundation for experiments on the transmission of visual images for several decades.
                            Out of the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk, two types of primitive television systems evolved: mechanical systems and electronic systems. 
                            Mechanical television systems had several technical disadvantages: low resolution caused fuzzy images and the use of a spinning disk limited the number of new pictures that could be seen per second, resulting in excessive flickering. 
                            By 1939, all mechanical television broadcasts in the United States had been replaced by electronic broadcasts.
                            Early televisions were expensive and the technology was slow to catch on, as development was delayed during World War II. 
                                Following the Second World War, television rapidly replaced radio as the new main form of mass communication.
                                During the “golden age” of television in the 1950s, television moved away from radio formats and began developing new types of shows, including the magazine-style variety show and the television spectacular.
                                Color television gained popularity in the late 1960s and began to replace black-and-white television in the 1970s. 
                                Cable television, initially developed in the 1940s to cater to viewers in rural areas, switched its focus from local to national broadcasts, offering a variety of channels. 
                                In 2009, the traditional analog system, which had been in place for 60 years, was replaced with digital television, giving viewers a higher-quality picture and freeing up frequency space. 
                                In 2010, nearly half of American viewers used high-definition television, which offers a crystal-clear picture, with wide-screen, to provide a "cinematic experience" at home.
                                Television has reflected changing cultural values, since it first gained popularity, following the Second World War.
                                During the 1950s, most programs ignored current events and political issues, in favor of family-friendly domestic comedies, featuring mainly white suburban middle-class families.

                                    Entrepreneurship is an essential driver of economic development. It is also the process of planning, launching and running a new business with the motive of earning profit and creating wealth
                                    Entrepreneurship is important because it boosts economic growth by introducing innovative technologies, products and services
                                    Increased competition from entrepreneurs challenges and also motivates the established companies to become more competitive and to renew and review their own methods of doing. So the economy benefits because newer products and newer services are brought in by the entrepreneurs
                                    There are four different types of Entrepreneurs and they are: Innovative Entrepreneurs, Replicative Entrepreneurs, Opportunity Entrepreneurs and, Necessity Entrepreneurs

                                        Entrepreneurs have major characteristics that tell them apart from manager and those characteristics are: they have got lots of confidence in our own technical and managerial competencies which makes them to see a market opportunity or a product opportunity where other people do not see same
                                        Entrepreneurship is important to the economy because it creates great economic wealth and creates huge employment
                                        The triggers of the quest for entrepreneurship are: a dislike for the paid job system, a revulsion in working for someone else's satisfaction, a firm conviction in one's technical and managerial competencies, etc
                                        The three aspects to an entrepreneur are: they have a purpose, they are creative and they have passion for their vocation
                                        Entrepreneurs create an expanding role of entrepreneurship because they are inventors and they are builders of a nation's economy
                                        Entrepreneurial discovery is a combination of: intrinsic entrepreneurial personality, acquired entrepreneurial experience, organizational and environmental expectations
                                        Assessment of the intrinsic entrepreneurial personality can be achieved to a reasonable degree with personality tests and assessment
                                        There are quite a number of entrepreneurial personality assessment tests and here are a few: psychometric tools, the more sophisticated tests such as Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), BDC etc

                Below you will find key information covered in this module:

                    Criminology includes studying all aspects of crime and law enforcement—criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, and capture and punishment. 
                    Crime is an act or omission in violation of a law committed without defence or justification. The Revised Penal Code (RPC) of Reyes (2018) states that crime is committed not only by malice (dolo) but also by means of fault (culpa). There is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent. There is fault when the wrongful act result from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill
                    The criminal profile describes the likely social and mental characteristics of the criminal. Victimology is a field with a less generally agreed-upon theoretical framework or research paradigm than many longer-established disciplines. 
                     Various crimes exist, including crimes against persons, victimless crimes, violent crimes, and white-collar crimes. Criminology is the study of crime and criminal behaviour, informed by principles of sociology and other non-legal fields, including psychology, economics, statistics, and anthropology.
                    The roots of criminology trace back to a movement to reform criminal justice and penal systems more than 200 years ago. The first collection and use of crime statistics in the 19th century then Basics of Criminal Investigation

                        Key points covered in this module are:
                            The significant changes in force projection did not occur until the nineteenth century, a change in which motivation and technology played a key role.
                            The age of cavalry was the age of poor infantry, and it was a political, not a technological, phenomenon.
                            It is hard to separate military experience from war thinking because the past is a source of examples and ideas.
                            The 7th century saw the birth of Islam, which brought with it a massive conquest effort.

                            During the world wars, trench warfare was transferred by a gradual evolution of artillery and infantry tactics, integrating new technology effectively.
                            The prime functions of aircraft were reconnaissance and artillery spotting-giving army gunners feedback on where their shells had landed.
                            World War I and II saw progress in wired and wireless communications technology.

                            The development of weaponry and other technology products affected warfare and its course profoundly and continuously.
                            The most significant single element in maintaining high morale is leadership.

                            Fear is managed in combat by decisive and capable leadership.

                            Tools of war have been instrumental in conquests, invasions, and enslavement throughout history, but they have also been used to check evil and maintain peace.
                            Military Weaponry and Aviation:
                                Weapons have evolved to become both more lethal and complex.
                                A great part of technology development of weaponry has taken part in the last two centuries, especially the twentieth century.
                                From the beginning of World War I, aircraft were used to drop bombs or heavy steel darts on enemy forces.
                                The bomber aircraft blurred the lines between combatants and non-combatants.
                            British Military History:
                                Aden became a functional coaling station for the Royal Navy and merchant vessels on passage to the Far East.
                                British policy was to preserve Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and continued Russian expansion in central Asia.
                                Britain's maritime involvement in the Far East had hitherto centred upon the Indian Ocean. Understanding Veterans' Mental Health

                    Lesson Summary
                        The United States has approximately 3.5 million military personnel comprised of various active duty, reserve, and Department of Defense civilian personnel.
                        The Army is the largest service branch with nearly 500,000 members followed by the Navy, Air Force, and Marines.
                        According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States has approximately 20 million veterans.
                        Military personnel face the full range of traumatic events experienced by civilians as well as events unique to military service.
                        Common traumatic events associated with military service include coming across a dead body unexpectedly and witnessing the injury or death of another person.
                        Military sexual trauma is defined as “sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment that occurred while the victim was in the military”.
                        Any deployment, even those to non-combat areas, is a significant event that can disrupt the lives of the service member and their family. 
                        A successful reintegration following a long or especially difficult deployment requires the entire family. 
                        Despite the benefits of seeking early mental health care, many of the mental health resources available to veterans remain vastly underutilized.
                        To ensure a standardized approach to mental health care throughout the entire VA system, the VA has established guidelines as to the types of mental health services that VA hospitals and clinics must offer to veterans and their families.

                    For many of us, the prospect of nuclear warfare raises fears of the end of life as we know it. 
                    Air Tests
                    Into the Deep
                    You may be surprised to learn that hundreds of nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmo
                    e Race for the First Atomic Bomb
                    The first nuclear bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. The project was launched in response to fears that the Nazis might try to construct an atom bomb after a major research breakthrough in 1938.

                    American Reaction
                    'Father' of the Atomic Bomb
                    German scientists Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann and Lise Meitner had discovered how to bombard uranium with neutrons, causing it to break up and release vast amounts of energy. The process is called splitting the atom, or nuclear fission. The trio received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966 for their discovery.

                    The First Test
                    On July 16, 1945, under President Truman, the Americans successfully detonated the first atomic bomb, in the Trinity Test. Those present watched in awe as an explosion equivalent to about 21,000 tons of the explosive TNT created a mushroom cloud that was over 3,000 feet wide and soared 40,000 feet in the sky.

                    Just one month later, the USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, forcing an end to World War II. 
                    We will look at that in more detail later.
                    The Arms Race
                    In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a burgeoning arms race saw the USA and USSR develop and test new types of bombs, with the USA focusing on methods of delivery and the Soviet Union aiming for maximum size or ‘yield’.
                    In the ensuing years, the UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also began to develop nuclear arsenals.

                    Decommissioned Weapons
                    Opt Outs
                    In 1970, after a period of escalation, the USA, USSR and UK, France and China signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT or Non-Proliferation Treaty), along with 38 other countries.
                    Atmospheric Tests
                    With so many countries developing nuclear weapons, you have probably already been exposed to fallout from  weapons tests in your lifetime, especially if you live in the northern hemisphere. Over 500 missiles have exploded above ground and in the skies above our heads.
                    UN: Radioactive Materials 'Everywhere'
                    In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reported to the General Assembly that: “The main man-made contribution to the exposure of the world's population has come from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, from 1945 to 1980. Each nuclear test resulted in the unrestrained release into the environment of substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface.”

                    543 Atmospheric Tests
                    Dangers Not Recognized
                    Annual Radiation Doses LowThe UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reported that levels of contamination had continued to drop since testing ended. “The average annual doses are 10% higher in the northern hemisphere, where most of the testing took place, and lower in the southern hemisphere. Although there was considerable concern at the time of testing, the annual doses remained relatively low, reaching at most about 7% of the background level from natural radiation sources.”
                    Monitoring ShortfallsWhile atmospheric tests were carried out above ground, an estimated 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990, according to UNSCEAR. Particularly during the early years, from 1945 to 1960, local populations that were

                    The events on the previous page chart the rapid transition of physics research from the blackboard to the test site. Most of the explosions yielded 15 to 23 kilotons, or the equivalent of 23,000 tons of TNT.
                    The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki yielded approximately 15 and 21 kilotons respectively. The death tolls on the previous page are a conservative estimate as tragically, the exact number of deaths has never been established.

                    Biggest Debut
                    The arms race began when the USSR detonated its first nuclear explosive in 1949 at the Semipalatinsk test site in modern-day Kazakhstan. Code-named RDS-1, the device had a yield of 22 kilotons and the fallout was detected by the USA.

                    The mushroom cloud soared 40 miles into the skies and was almost 60 miles wide. Severe damage was experienced up to 150 miles away with light damage as far as Norway and Finland.

                    North Korea
                    1963: As a consequence of Tsar Bomba, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain on August 5. It prohibits testing in the atmosphere, in outer space, under water, or in any area within a state’s territory that would cause ‘radioactive debris’ to fall outside the state's territory. There are now 126 parties to the PNTBT.
                    Since 1980, all nuclear tests have been conducted underground.
                    Current Nuclear Arms Treaties
                    Over the decades a number of treaties have been agreed upon, which attempt to ensure transparency and accountability worldwide. The most significant include:

                        Partial Ban: As mentioned, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banned testing in the atmosphere, outerspace, underwater or anywhere that might contaminate a neighboring country.
                        Comprehensive Ban: The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996 bans all nuclear explosions, for civilian or military purposes, however, it has yet to be enforced.
                        New START: A third arrangement is the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. New START came into force on February 5, 2011, and lasts until February 4, 2026. It imposes limits on both countries so long as the treaty remains in force.
                        JCPOA for Iran: Finally, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an agreement between Iran and China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the USA dated July 14, 2015. It allows for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify Iran’s nuclear capability. On May 30, 2022, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to credibly explain the presence of altered uranium at Turquzabad, Varamin and ‘Marivan’, or the location(s) of the nuclear material that was moved from Turquzabad in 2018. Further, nuclear activities and nuclear material used at Lavisan-Shian were not declared as required under the Compreh
                        What Causes a Nuclear Explosion?
                        About AtomsAll matter is made up of atoms - minute structures that combine a mix of three particles called protons (which have a positive electric charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge). 
                        Each atom has a nucleus at its center, where the neutrons and protons are close together.
                        Splitting the Atom
                        Breaking a nucleus by bombarding it with neutrons causes the amount of energy associated with explosives to be released.
                        Fission and Fusion
                        Nuclear explosions are divided into two types. In both instances, some sort of conventional explosive is needed to trigger the initial reaction.
                        Nuclear Fission
                        Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Not all elements lend themselves to the process. The most commonly used isotope is uranium-235. This is because uranium ore (pictured) occurs naturally in the earth and in seawater and can go through an ‘enriching’ process to become fissionable U-235.
                        Plutonium-239, uranium-233, and thorium-232 may also be used. These isotopes are variations of the element with different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Plutonium is a byproduct of nuclear fission and can be reprocessed for use more easily than uranium can be enriched, however, it is extremely radioactive. Needless to say, both enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium are complex and expensive procedures.

                    What Impact Would a Nuclear Explosion Have?
                    Many factors influence the severity of the damage caused by an explosion - the materials used in the weapon, the size of it, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and what the weather is like at the time. These factors also affect the resulting shockwave, thermal radiation, light and radioactivity, therefore it is difficult to generalize about the impact of any given explosion.

                    The only certainty is that those closest to the explosion are most at risk from the intense heat of the fireball, the powerful shockwave created by the blast, and ionizing radiation, but the chances of survival increase rapidly the further you are from ground zer

                    The Emergency Response
                    In the event of a blast, emergency planners would divide the area around a blast site into Severe, Moderate and Light Damage zones. The following information, courtesy of the USDHHS Radiation Emergency Medical Management, describes what emergency workers might expect as they approach from the Light Damage Zone and proceed towards ground zero:
                    Light Damage (LD) Zone
                    Litter and Rubble
                    Blast Overpressures
                    Damage is caused by shocks, similar to those produced by a thunderclap or a sonic boom, but with much more force. 


                    Although some windows may be broken over 10 miles (16 km) away, the injury associated with flying glass will generally occur at overpressures above 0.5 psi. 


                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about 3 miles (4.8 km) from ground zero for a 10 KT nuclear explosion. The damage in this area will be highly variable as shock waves rebound multiple times off of buildings, the terrain, and even the atmosphere.
                    The Moderate Damage Zone
                    Responders may expect they are transitioning into the MD zone when building damage becomes substantial.
                    Structural Damage
                    Street Clearing
                    Hazards
                    This damage may correspond to a distance of about one mile (1.6 km) from ground zero for a 10KT nuclear explosion. The determination is made by ground-level and/or overhead imagery.


                    Observations in the MD zone include significant structural damage, blown-out building interiors, blown-down utility lines, overturned automobiles, caved roofs, some collapsed buildings, and fires. Some telephone poles and street light poles will also be blown over.

                    Sturdier buildings (e.g., reinforced concrete) will remain standing, lighter commercial and multi-unit residential buildings may be fallen or structurally unstable, and many wood-frame houses will be destroyed
                    The Severe Damage Zone
                    Few Survivors
                    Rubble
                    Hiroshima
                    Few, if any, buildings are expected to be structurally sound or even standing in the Severe Damage (SD) zone, and very few people would survive.


                    However, some people protected within stable structures (e.g., subterranean parking garages or subway tunnels) at the time of the explosion may survive the initial blast.


                    Very high radiation levels from prompt and residual origin and other hazards are expected in the SD zone, significantly increasing risks to survivors and responders. Responders should enter this zone with great caution, only to rescue known survivors.

                    The previous pages consider the degrees of damage from a 10-kiloton explosion, however, as we have already stated, everything from the position of a device when it is detonated to the weather on the day can have a bearing on the outcome.
                    Yields
                    Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs are a great deal more destructive, or give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs. While many weapons tests have been carried out over the years, governments have been loath to reveal full details due to military sensitivities. The overall yield of explosions has been documented, however, the amount of fusion and fission yields from each test remain unknown, making it difficult for scientists to predict the degree of hazard posed by future explosions.
                    Remote TestsFurthermore, the sites of all the tests carried out over the years have been oceans or deserts, which limit the creation of fires and smoke, and therefore give a less than accurate portrayal of the impact of an explosion in the sort of urban setting that might be targeted in a military attack

                    Nuclear weapons in the modern era tend to be classified as either ‘tactical’ or ‘nonstrategic’ nuclear weapons or as ‘strategic’ or ‘long range’ weapons. Tactical or nonstrategic weapons are regarded as ‘battle’ weapons, with a shorter range and lower yield than ‘strategic’ or long-range weapons, which are more powerful and are designed to attack another country. Tactical weapons do not appear to be included in the New START treaty between the USA and the USSR. See https://www.state.gov/new-start/ for details.

                    'Cannot Be Won'
                    In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.  In June 2022, tensions rose over Russian fears that Ukraine's allies in the EU might supply it with nuclear weapons following the Russian invasion.
                    Nuclear Tests Underground
                    We have seen that the place where an explosion happens - in the atmosphere or on the ground - has an impact on the degree of devastation caused. Devices that explode in the air create less fallout than those on the ground. But what do we know of the impact of an explosion underground or underwater?
                    In the case of an explosion at ground level, radioactive fallout is a much more pressing danger than it is in the case of an atmospheric or air explosion, as the blast causes much dirt and debris to be sucked up from the ground and irradiated.
                    Underground Tests
                    Between the year of 1963 when the Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, until 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed, the world’s major nuclear powers tested hundreds of weapons underground. In fact, the USA alone performed 815 underground tests over the decades, mainly at the Nevada Test Site (pictured).

                    o Nuclear Tests Trigger Earthquakes?
                    The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation is often compared to or measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, that does not necessarily mean that the explosion has caused an earthquake. For instance, the Cannikin test in Alaska released energy equivalent to a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, however, it did not trigger any earthquakes in the seismically active Aleutian Islands.

                    The seismic waves produced by underground nuclear explosions have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes. 

                    The US Geological Survey acknowledges that nuclear explosions may cause earthquakes, however, these are much smaller than the explosion, and the aftershock sequence produces fewer and smaller aftershocks than a similar size earthquake. The range of a possible earthquake triggered by an explosion is limited to a few tens of kilometers.
                    Hiroshima and Nagasaki
                    There have been numerous weapons tests and many serious accidents in which radioactive material was leaked, however, there remain just two occasions when nuclear bombs were deliberately unleashed in an act of war. The fact that both targets were urban areas gives a different perspective on the consequences of a nuclear explosion from tests in unpopulated areas.
                    The former Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall was one of the few buildings to survive the bombing of Hiroshima. It’s now famous as the A-Bomb Dome, or the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.

                    Lesson Summary
                    The main points you have learned from this module are as follows:

                        Nuclear weapons tests over the 35 years from 1945 to 1980 have unleashed the equivalent of 29,000 Hiroshima size bombs in the earth’s atmosphere.
                        German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered how to split the atom by bombarding uranium with neutrons in a process called nuclear fission, in 1938.
                        The race to build the first nuclear weapon began when Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt about their concerns that the Nazis might weaponize Hahn and Strassman’s discovery.
                        The first atomic bomb was developed by the Manhattan Project, headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. It was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity Test and its 21 kiloton yield created a mushroom cloud over 3,000 feet wide and 40,000 feet high.
                        The USA dropped bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945, bringing an end to World War II.
                        The Arms Race began in the late 1940s and early 1950s between the USA and USSR. The UK (1952), France (1960) and China (1964) also developed nuclear arsenals. In 1970, all five countries signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
                        Other nuclear powers include Pakistan (1972), India (1974), Israel and North Korea. South Africa, Ukraine and Uzbekistan dismantled their nuclear arsenals.
                        Lesson Summary
                            In 2000, the UN’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation said that from 1945 to 1980, nuclear tests had released ‘substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface’.
                            The USA and the USSR tested thermonuclear weapons in 1952-3, spreading fallout worldwide. In 1958 the US Food and Drug Administration reported that tea harvests from 1956 and 1957 had 30 times more radioactive isotope strontium-90 than pre-1945 samples.
                            In October 1963, after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USA, the UK and the USSR signed a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; France and China continued atmospheric tests.
                            Atmospheric tests ceased in 1980 after 543 tests caused radionuclides, particularly strontium-90 and cesium-137 to be dispersed throughout the atmosphere.
                            Approximately 50 tests were carried out underground each year from 1962 to 1990.
                            The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was opened for signatures in 1996, however, it has not been enforced yet.
                            According to the geomapping company Esri UK , there have been 2,624 nuclear detonations across the world since 1945.
                            The sites of all the tests ca
                            Lesson Summary
                                Modern weapons are classified as either ‘tactical’ or ‘nonstrategic’ nuclear (battle) weapons or as ‘strategic’ or ‘long range’ weapons designed to attack another country.
                                In January 22, five nuclear powers - China, the USA, Russia, France and the UK reaffirmed the declaration from President Ronald Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’.
                                Many factors influence the destructive capacity of a nuclear explosion - the materials used in the weapon, its size, whether it explodes in the air, on the ground, in the sea or underground, whether the target area is urban or rural and the weather.
                                In the case of a 10 kiloton explosion, the Severe Damage Zone is estimated at about a half-mile radius (0.8km); the Moderate Damage Zone would be about one mile, or 1.6km; the Light Damage Zone is likely to extend about 3 miles or 4.8km from ground zero.
                                Atomic bombs use nuclear fission where an atom is used to split a heavy nucleus into lighter ones, creating energy. Thermonuclear or Hydrogen bombs use fission for the initial explosion followed by nuclear fusion where further energy is released as two nuclei are fused to become one. Thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs give a much higher ‘yield’ than atomic (fission only) bombs.
                                Thermal Radiation consists of an initial rapid burst of ultraviolet radiation, followed by a second, more sustained pulse. It reaches temperatures of up to 100 million degrees centigrade, causing combustible materials to ignite. Smoke or clouds can mitigate this risk.

                            Lesson Summary
                                The strength of the blast is measured by the pound per square inch (psi) of pressure above the normal atmospheric amount. The blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound. In an atmospheric explosion, the first and second blast waves merge to form a Mach Stem.
                                1963’s Test Ban Treaty barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater, so nuclear powers tested their weapons underground.
                                The first underground test took place at the Nevada test site in the USA in 1951 while the US conducted its last nuclear test, codenamed Divider, at an underground facility in Nevada on September 23, 1992. It carried out 815 underground tests. In 1996 the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty officially ended all testing. 
                                The largest underground US nuclear explosion was the Cannikin test on Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, on November 6, 1971. The shock registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. Wildlife was badly affected locally but there was no tsunami and almost no radioactivity. Seafood is safe for human consumption.
                                The size of explosion caused by an underground nuclear detonation may be measured in terms of the energy released by an earthquake, however, the seismic waves have unique characteristics which enable geologists to differentiate between explosions and earthquakes.
                                In 1969, research at the Nevada Test Site found the tests did not trigger earthquakes in earthquake-prone California.

                        Introduction
                        Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the landscape of contemporary mental health and criminology. As society grapples with increasing challenges at the intersection of mental health and violent behavior, it is crucial for professionals navigating these terrains to be deeply informed, both theoretically and pragmatically.
                        This course delves into the pertinence of understanding this complex interplay, beginning with an exploration of the key findings from the Bureau of Justice Report - Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement from 2011. Armed with this data-driven context, participants will transition into mastering basic initial screening techniques, subsequently diving deep into the intricate relationships between various mental health disorders and the potential for violent behavior.
                        Anchored by robust guiding studies, an exploration into the nuances of psychopathy, and a meticulous understanding of homicide typology, the course offers a comprehensive look into the subject. Moreover, as firearms remain a significant factor in the equation, emphasis on promoting firearm safety with patients becomes paramount, a theme accentuated by scrutinizing firearm availability statistics. By the culmination of this course, participants will possess a sophisticated, multidimensional grasp of Homicide Risk Evaluation and its intrinsic tie to Firearm Safety
                        The Relevance
                        Among U.S. citizens, homicide is still the second leading cause of death (tied with suicide) between the ages of 1-24 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) and between the third to fifth leading cause of death between the ages of 25-44 (Miniño, 2013; Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016) depending on how you split up the age range (25-44 vs. 25-34). The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations; with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.
                        Shift in Trend
                        The U.S. Annual Homicide Rate
                        Gun-Related Homicides in the U.S.
                        Although violent crime rates fell over 50% from 1993 to 2015 (e.g., Gramlich, 2017), the more than two-decade downward trend for violent crime in the U.S. appears to be shifting and rates have been rising in recent years. For example, an estimated 14,827 persons were murdered in the U.S. in 2012 (FBI 1, 2012); a number that while not including “justifiable” homicide, represents a slightly higher homicide rate than the 2011 rate of 4.7 homicides per 100,000 persons that was the lowest homicide rate since 1963 (Smith & Cooper, 2013).
                        The Relevance (Contd)
                        In comparison to other high-income nations, overall, Americans are:

                            Seven times more likely to be violently killed
                            Twenty-five times more likely to be violently killed with a gun
                            Six times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun
                            Eight times more likely to commit suicide using a gun
                            Ten times more likely to die from a firearm death overall (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).

                        In 2014, the overall rate of death by firearms in the United States was 10.3 per 100,000 people — the same as for death by motor vehicles — with suicides accounting for roughly two out of every three gun-related deaths. 
                        To illustrate the recent upward trend consider that in the first 200 days of 2014, there were 6,206 gun deaths on record, not counting suicides. Data collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit organization that tracks shootings via media reports and law enforcement records, show that within the first 200 days of 2017, that figure jumped by well over one-third to

                        From 2002 to 2011, young adults ages 18 to 24 had the highest homicide rate of any age group and experienced the greatest rate decline (down 22%) over the 10 years, from 15.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 11.9 in 2011.	The rate of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 49% from 1992 to 2011, while the percentage of homicide victims killed by a firearm (67%) remained stable.
                        Large cities with 100,000 or more residents experienced the largest decline (23%) in homicide rates from 2002 to 2011, compared to communities with less than 100,000 residents.	From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide incidents involved a single victim. In 2011, 66% of homicides with a single victim involved a firearm, compared to 79% of homicide incidents with multiple victims.

                        What Do Clinicians Need to Understand
                        Assessments, Screenings and Guidelines for Clinicians
                        America’s unique gun culture has dire consequences. The U.S. has the most firearms per capita in the world. Despite having only half the population of the other 22 high-income nations combined, data suggests that the U.S. accounts for 82% of all firearm deaths globally, and that the U.S. accounts for 90% of all women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, and 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years who were killed by firearms worldwide (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016). Moreover, while the overall suicide rate in the U.S. is on par with other high-income nations, the gun suicide rate in America is eight times higher (Grinsheteyn & Hemenway, 2016).

                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques
                        When patients admit to homicidal ideation, mental health providers ask the following questions to assess risk (Pinard & Pagani, 2001):

                            Is there an identifiable victim - a specific person(s) or a specific location, such as an office building?
                            Does the patient have a plan? Is the plan rational and lethal? Has there been any progression in planning?
                            Does he or she have access to the intended weapon?
                            Is the victim available, e.g. does the patient have access to him or her?
                            Has the patient taken steps to practice or prepare? For example, if the patient fantasizes about releasing a round of bullets at his previous place of work, has he engaged in any preliminary behaviors such as stalking, obtaining worker schedules, or creating a drawing of the building layout?
                            What, if anything, stops the patient from acting on his or her violent thoughts?

                        Questions like these can help determine if a patient needs to be evaluated in the inpatient setting or if the evaluation can be safely conducted in the outpatient setting.
                        Basic Initial Screening Techniques (Contd)
                        Also helpful in evaluating dangerousness are questions that address risk factors for violent behavior (Derefinko et al., 2011; Pinard & Pagani, 2001), such as:

                            Does the patient have a history of violent behavior toward people or animals? Does the patient have a criminal record?
                            Does the patient display problems with impulse control?
                            Has the patient ever been diagnosed with Axis I or Axis II disorders? If so, what disorder(s)?
                            If the patient is prescribed psychopharmacological medications, what are they? Has he or she been taking the medications as prescribed?
                            Is the patient abusing alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescribed medications?
                            If the patient receives services from a primary care physician or psychiatrist, when was he or she last seen?
                            What if any sources or recent events have occurred that might lead to major disappointment or anger?

                        Violent sprees are often preceded by a trigger related to losses or perceived rejections, such as a breakup, being fired from a job, or being rejected for admission into a college or the military (Pinard & Pagani, 2001).
                        Adjunct consultation with other health providers, such as the patient’s primary care physician, will often provide valuable information about the patient’s prescribed medications, adherence to medications, psychiatric history, medical problems, and family history.

                        Reasons for Psychiatric Evaluation
                        A history of substance abuse, head injury, or a mental health disorder with the potential for psychotic thinking (e.g. mania, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, delusional disorder, and dementia) may be associated with detriments in self-control and should therefore be considered a strong indicator for immediate psychiatric evaluation. In addition, when a patient has made a direct threat of intent to harm, psychiatric evaluation should be obtained. Forced psychiatric evaluation raises issues related to morality (Bennett et al. 1993) and civil liberties (Testa & West, 2010).

                            Given the disparities in homicide rates across different demographic groups, how can healthcare professionals ensure they approach these statistics without bias, and provide equitable care and assessment for all patients, regardless of their demographic background?
                            How can mental health professionals effectively balance the need for safety precautions and risk assessments with maintaining trust and therapeutic rapport with their patients, especially when discussing topics as sensitive as violent ideation and firearm accessibility?
                            Considering the U.S. gun culture and the alarming statistics surrounding firearm deaths, how might healthcare professionals address the topic of firearm safety in therapeutic settings without triggering defensiveness or resistance, and promote a dialogue that prioritizes the well-being of the patient and the community?

                        Mental Health and Risk for Violent Behavior
                        Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. This finding is robust even when other risk factors are controlled, such as being male, growing up in a violent neighborhood, and being less educated (Link et al., 1992; Swanson et al., 1990).
                        Personality Disorders
                        Psychological disorders are quite common among violent individuals, especially Cluster B Personality Disorders: Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). 
                        While in most cases the suspicions of individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) provoke only insults and lawsuits, in a small number of cases they can foment violence (Tardiff, 2001). The key DSM 5 Criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for these disorders are summarized in the page titled–Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence.
                        Personality Disorders Associated with Risk for Violence
                        Antisocial Personality Disorder
                        Thrill-seeking, reckless, impulsive, deceitful, irritable, aggressive, irresponsible, violates the law, lacks remorse, and has a history of violence toward animals and/or people
                        Narcissistic Personality Disorder
                        Histrionic Personality Disorder
                        Borderline Personality Disorder

                        Dangerous Hallucinations 
                        Not all hallucinations carry the same risk for violence; some types of hallucinations are associated with a greater risk. Auditory “command” hallucinations that tell the patient to hurt him/herself or hurt another are significantly associated with potential future violence (Barrowcliff & Haddock, 2010). Visual hallucinations can also be dangerous.

                        Gellerman and Suddath (2005) reviewed court decisions on the matter and concluded “…the courts considered the expression of violent fantasies to be an indication that the patients were potentially dangerous, particularly in the context of having a history of violent or threatening behavior (p. 486).” To clarify, providers were not typically held responsible for failing in the duty to warn in the case of violent fantasy without a history of violence. There were some exceptions.

                        The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was tasked with assembling the current knowledge about violent risk assessment and creating an actuarial model that could successfully predict violence and be developed into a computer-based decision tree for practitioners. 
                        The MacArthur team interviewed male and female patients (N = 1,136) between the ages of 18 and 40 during an acute civil inpatient hospitalization who had a chart diagnosis of thought or affective disorder, substance abuse, or personality disorder. 
                        Participants were interviewed at ten-week intervals for one-year post-discharge to evaluate factors related to risk for violence (The MacArthur Research Network on Mental Disorder and the Law, 2005)1

                        Findings: The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study
                        The team’s findings about risk factors for violence are highlighted as follows:
                        Gender: Violence by Men Vs. Violence by Women
                        Men were somewhat more likely than women to be violent, but the difference was not large. Violence by women was more likely than violence by men to be directed against family members and to occur at home, and less likely to result in medical treatment or arrest.

The ICT will be discussed in more detail when we turn our discussion to assessment measures.

                        Premorbid and Contemporaneous Clinical Factors
                        Example of Two Patients
                        Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Van Dorn et al. (2012) conducted a large two-wave study of mental illness and violence. 
                        They concluded, “...there is a statistically significant, yet modest relationship between recent serious mental illness (SMI) (within 12 months) and violence, and a stronger relationship between SMI with substance use disorder and violence. 
                        Extrapolating from Van Dorn et al.’s work, it may be that to date the prediction of violence in clinical settings has failed largely due to the complexity of the predictive equation.
                        Evaluating the Potential for Violent Behaviour
                        Litwach et al. (2006) note that too little research has been conducted on psychiatric patients hospitalized for violent behavior, but they do provide a list of risk factors for violent behavior based on empirical studies currently available. This list serves as a good summary guide for mental health providers when evaluating a patient’s potential for dangerous behavior (p 503). According to their review, Litwach et al. (2006) suggest the most important risk factors to attend to include:

                            Active psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, plus a history of violence or current hostile attitudes
                            The presence of delusional beliefs about significant others and specific personal targets, especially that a significant other has been replaced by an imposter
                            Severe and chronic self-destructiveness
                            Command hallucinations to commit violence when the hallucinated voice is identified; when there is also a delusion related to the hallucination; or when the content of the hallucination includes reference to self-harm
                            Erotomania with multiple delusional objects and a history of serious antisocial behavior unrelated to delusions
                            Recent and currently active narcissistic injury; isolation of affect or grossly inappropriate affect; threatening or provocative behavior, which is usually minimized by the patient; and the availability of a weapon.

                        Psychopathy and Homicide Typology
                        Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. It is worth making a clear clinical distinction between the two. Let’s begin with psychopathy and then contrast it with homicide typology.

                        Dimensions that Define Psychopathy
                        Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised
                        Psychopathy, the first personality disorder listed in the DSM, was later subsumed by the current Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD). Curiously, many forensic specialists have retained the use of the term psychopathy for those whose affect and behavior suggest a level of deviance beyond that of the typical Antisocial individual. In other words, psychopathy can be thought of as the worst of the worst.

                        A Psychopath's Sketch
                        Based on Hare’s list of psychopathy traits, the psychopath’s interpersonal style would appear glib and superficial, manipulative and cunning. His shallow effect belies an inability to empathize or feel guilt for wrongdoing. An appealing veneer often obscures these character deficiencies. He is a con artist, a charlatan - not what he seems to be. The psychopath behaves in impulsive and irresponsible ways that feed an excessive hunger for stimulation. This can lead to trouble. While some psychopaths find a home in careers that reward risk-taking and cold efficiency, many end up in prison or leading a parasitic life on the fringes of society. In any case, the psychopath’s life is marked by failed relationships, numerous improprieties, and, sometimes, acts of violence.

                        If psychopathy can be reduced to abnormalities in brain anatomy and function, can we blame psychopaths for their actions? Are these abnormalities congenital and/or developmentally acquired? How does this information affect treatment approaches with psychopaths? The list of ethical, clinical, and biological questions generated by such findings goes on and on. The questions will grow even more complex as brain imaging and the study of genetics advances.

                        Other Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Homicide
                        The Most Common Method
                        Given the recent phenomena of T.V. programs like CSI and Criminal Minds, many people are familiar with the concept of profiling. Profilers make use of psychological research on violent crime and criminals to enhance law enforcement efforts. One specific way researchers study violence is to study the perpetrators of specific types of crime. As you’ll see below, much work has been done on three types of homicide, intimate partner homicide, spree killing/mass murder, and serial killing.
                        Intimate Partner Homicide (Contd)
                        A history of non-fatal strangulation is also a significant risk factor for intimate partner homicide. Glass and colleagues (2007) found that “women who were victims of completed or attempted homicide were far more likely to have a history of strangulation [p. 332]” when compared with controls. 
                        Moreover, women with a history of being strangled had seven times the odds of becoming a victim of attempted homicide. It is important, therefore, that mental health providers inquire specifically about choking and attempted strangulation when evaluating homicide risk.
                        Profiling Intimate Partner Killers
                        Role of Mental Health Provider
                        Things to Do
                        There is no clear profile of intimate partner killers, although insecure attachment patterns, cultural factors, childhood exposure to parental intimate partner violence, and external stressors have been implicated (Elisha et al., 2010). In light of the statistics and the consequences for harm, mental healthcare providers should regularly assess their male patients for perpetrator status. While men are somewhat reluctant to admit to current intimate partner violence, they are more willing to admit to past violence, and this may be used as a prevention measure. Additionally, men are more willing to admit to perpetrating violence anonymously; however, data from this type of assessment are less likely to result in effective prevention (Jaeger et al., 2008).
                        Spree Killing or Mass Murder
                        The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders (FBI 8, 2008). The term “mass murder” is sometimes used when the homicides occur in one location.
                        Profile of Spree Killers
                        The Motivation
                        In general, spree killers have an identifiable profile. They are most often white, middle-class males, single or divorced. They tend to be paranoid and depressive and have Cluster A or B personality disorders (i.e., Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal, Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic) or features of those disorders (Hare, 1993; Pinard & Pagani, 2001)
                        Structured Assessment Measures
                        Relatively little attention has been paid to risk assessment and prevention even though homicide is a leading cause of death in the U.S. While mental health professionals cannot definitively predict homicide, violence prevention in some cases may be enhanced through accurate mental health diagnosis and the use of objective screening measures or algorithms, especially in the cases of intimate partner violence and mass murder.
                        Premorbid Environmental Factors
                        Standard Measures
                        Clinicians who navigate the murky waters of assessing dangerousness need to consider premorbid environmental factors, such as childhood victimization, exposure to violence, and parental neglect; current environmental factors, such as negative peer influences, neighborhood violence, and reduced access to treatment; and clinical factors, such as severity of symptomology, symptom stability, co-morbid diagnoses, whether there is a history violent behavior, alcohol and/or substance abuse, the degree of insight, and the presence or absence of hostility (Van Dorn et al., 2012; Monahan et al., 2005). Clinicians should be aw
                        Structured Assessment Measures: Adult Measures
                        When assessing risk for violent behavior among adults, sole reliance on unstructured clinical judgments or clinical intuition is strongly ill-advised; use of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and/or other well-validated measures is recommended as standard care (Gendreau et al., 2006; Hare, 2006; Monahan et al., 2001; Quinsey et al., 2006).

                        The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare & Neumann, 2006) is the most used tool in the forensic psychologist’s bag. The PCL-R was initially developed to derive a clinical construct of psychopathy. The checklist’s 20 items load on four factors or dimensions - Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, and Antisocial - described in detail earlier in the course and summarized in Table 3. The test can be administered by a non-expert in an interview setting, and can take anywhere from a few minutes to much longer, depending on the patient’s history and whether there is any difficulty obtaining case history from external sources, such as parents or prison records.
                        are of the signs and symptoms of psychopathy as well so that they can advise potential victims and seek hospitalization for potential perpetrators.
                        Measures Specific to Intimate Partner Violence
                        The field of intimate partner violence (IPV) risk assessment (predicting recidivism and lethality) has been rapidly growing, with the majority of research conducted in the past decade. When assessing intimate partner violence (IPV), some measures are directed toward perpetrators, and some are directed toward victims of abuse.

                        Spousal Assault Risk Assessment (SARA)
                        The Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA; e.g., Hilton et al., 2004; Hilton et al., 2010) was created from research on nearly 600 cases of reported IPV and contains 13 yes/no questions that predict the risk of future assault with relatively high accuracy using these questions alone. Thus, it reduces the need for a comprehensive assessment to evaluate the risk of re-offense by male perpetrators.

                        Findings on Limitations
                        There are many helpful scales available to assess victim risk. One such scale is the HITS (Sherin et al., 1998), which involves asking the patient about the frequency with which his or her partner has “H” art, “I” insulted, “T” threatened, or “S” creamed. Answers to the four questions are provided using a 5- 5-point Likert-type scale (1=Never to 5=Frequently), yielding a total score.
                        The HITS is a validated instrument and a popular screen for the primary care setting because it is quick and easy to use. More information about the HITS links to a PDF of the measure and scoring instructions are available to view online1, but be mindful that the HITS is copyrighted and available for public use and can only be reproduced with the author’s permissio

                        PCL-R & PCL-YV
                        Copelan et al. (2006) devised and validated an algorithm, known as the Violence Ideation and Suicidality Treatment Algorithm (VISTA), for emergency department physicians to use in identifying adolescents at risk of serious violent behavior (See Table 5 on the next page). Using VISTA, adolescents could be successfully identified as being at low, intermediate, or high risk for violent behavior with a detection sensitivity of 80.3% and a specificity of 98.1%.

                        The key points that were covered in this module are:

                            Homicide Risk Evaluation and Firearm Safety form a critical nexus in the contemporary mental health and criminology landscape.
                            The U.S. has the unfortunate distinction of ranking first in homicide among high-income nations, with the overall homicide rate 6.9 to 10 times higher.
                            Psychiatric admission can be voluntary or involuntary. Mental health professionals often play a pivotal role in initiating involuntary assessment and hospitalization.
                            Most people suffering from mental health disorders are not violent; however, there is an increased risk for violent behavior among patients with mental health diagnoses, especially among those with serious mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse.
                            Mental health providers should be diligent in monitoring patients who suffer from disorders that can result in heightened paranoia and suspiciousness or other disturbances of thought, such as paranoid schizophrenia, dementia with frontal involvement, and, in some cases, organic brain disease. 
                            Since a delusion is a false notion inconsistent with the person’s background that is held with great conviction despite clear evidence to the contrary on a fundamental level, all delusions impair judgment, but not all delusions are imminently dangerous.
                            Fantasies, or daydreams, are distinguished from delusions by the patient’s control over their content, initiation, and cessation.

                        Lesson Summary
                        The key points that were covered in this module are:

                            The findings from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study led to the development of the measure, The Multiple Iterative Classification Tree or ICT.
                            Not all killers are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are killers. 
                            Psychopathy, characterized by a constellation of traits like lack of empathy and chronic manipulative behavior, does not inherently lead to violent acts like homicide, whereas homicide typology aids in categorizing different motives and patterns of lethal acts. 
                            Intimate partner violence (IPV) consists of mental, physical, and/or sexual abuse committed by an intimate partner. At the heart of IPV is the belief that one is entitled to control one’s partner and an obsessive need to exercise that control.
                            The FBI defines spree killing as a type of homicide involving at least four murders in close succession at multiple locations with no cooling-off period between murders. 
                            The FBI defines serial murder as “the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events.
                             The serial murderer often blends in with the community and may appear to others as a “normal” individual, although psychopathy and serial killing are closely linked.
